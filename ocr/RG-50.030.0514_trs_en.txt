Beginning Ta pe One 
 
Question: Good morning, Mr. Kagan. 
Answer: Good morning 

Q: We lcome  to Wa shington, and now
 Virginia. It™s nice to see you. 
A: Thank you. Nice to be here. 

Q: Your name  now is? 

A: Saul Kagan. S-
a-u-l K-a-g-a-n. 
Q: Is that the name  you were born with? 

A: I was born -- except in Yiddish 
it is not Saul, but it is Shaul, 
which is with an S-h in -- in 
Yiddish. But -- 

Q: But it -- but Kagan was your name? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Yes. 

A: As a matter of fact, it is essent ially all the 
c --  all the Jews who wa
s [indecipherable] na me  
was -- was supposed to be Cohen, and lived 
under the Tsarist rule, ended up being Kaggen, 
Kogen, Kaganovic, because the Russia
n alphabet does not have an H. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: If you pick up a Russian ma p of New York C
ity, the river is not Hudson River, but Kudson 
River. It™s it -- 

Q: That™s right. 
A: -- it literally is so. 
Q: Yes.

A: So as you know, Poland was disme mbered at the end of the 18
th
 century. The part which 
under the control of ei
ther Prussia or Austria,th-the -- the Jews there ar
e Cohens, with a C-o-h-e-
n. All the ones who were on -- on th
e eastern end of it, which is mo
st of what used to be Poland, 
eastern Poland and so on, ended up as Kagga
ns, Kogens, Koganovic™s and so on, but -- 
Q: So that™s how you got your name ? 
A: And that [indecipherable] name  is, if 
you™ll open up a f -- and 
-- the Manhattan phone book, 
or -- you™ll fi nd a lot of K-a-g-a-n™s,
 and so that -- that™s the name . 
Q: So when were you born? 

A: I was born in 1922, in Wilna. 

Q: And wha t  month? 

A: July the 20
th
. 
Q: July the 20
th
, in Wilna, and it was then Poland. 
A: Poland. It was -- if you look at the pre -- 
pre-World Wa r II ma p of Poland, the only time 
Poland existed as an independent count
ry was from 1918 to 1939, after which it was 
disme mbered again. And prior to 
that it -- it -- it wa -- ther e wa
s the independent Poland since 
1790-some thing. That™s how we ended up with 
Koshchensko and Pulaski highways around here. 
They -- yeah, they were running from -- they we
re fighting for i-independence of Poland. Poland 
was being disme mbered, so they had to run. Wher e 
did they run?  They ran to a country which -- 
which was trying to --  to -- to liber ate itsel
f, or -- or -- or to become  independent. 

Q: Right. 

A: Anyway, there was no independent Pola
nd really, for -- from the end of the 18
th
 century until 
1918. And in 21 years it disappeared again. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514

A: And Wilna was the northern -- 
th-the north --  the largest city in the northeastern part of 
Poland at that time , and 
it bordered on Lithuania. 
Q: And was it called Wi lno, or Wilna? 
A: It was called Wilna in Polish, and Vilna in Yiddish. 

Q: In Yiddish, oh. 

A: And it was a very active center of Yiddish li
fe. There were 60,000 Jews in Wilna, but they 

had a very active or ganizational institutional. For 
instance, the one scientif
ic institute focused on 
the history of central European Jewry, and the 
center for the study of Yiddi
sh as a language was 
established in Wilna, it™s called the YI VO. 

Q: Right. 

A: It is today in New York on -- on -- on We st 16
th
 Street. And -- and that was established there 
and it was there until at  the end of it, the -- the 
-- the Nazi [indecipherable] the Rosenberg™s team 
took over the yu -- the YIVO and -- a
nd to some  extent they -- they
 salvaged a good part of it, 
and the YIVO has it now in its archives. 

Q: Right. 

A: The U.S. army found it in -- yeah. 

Q: Do you know what the overall population of Wilno -- you said sixt -- 

A: Two hun -- 200,000 at that time. 

Q: And 60,000 were Jews. 

A: 60,000 were Jews, and y -- and [indeciphe
rable] probably around 120 or thereabouts 
[indecipherable] were Poles, and I -- I ma y be 
off by, but I mean it was -- and -- and a small 
number of Lithuanians, Ukrain
ians and so on. But -- and it -- it 
has, as far as the Jewish 
community is concerned, it has a very well deve
loped communal intra -- in
frastructure. It has 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
4 
 
 
day -- Jewish day schools, both Yiddish day scho
ols, Hebrew day schools.
 And it -- it had, as I 
say, it had a hospital, it had -- it had a very famo
us library, one of the ol
dest libraries, Jewish 
libraries in Europe called the 
Strashun Library, was located in 
Wilno. And of course the gowan 
of Wilno, who was the -- was the great rabbinica
l authority and scholar, 
and he lived in there 
latter part of the 18
th
 century, and to this day there is th
e -- the -- the home of the Gaon. Gaon is 
the sage of Wilna is -- is there, and he wa
s actually the -- the spiritual and the -- and the 
theologi cal head of -- of the [indecipherable] mo ve
me nt whi c h is the one he -- he considered that 
H-Has-Chasidism to be a -- actually a -- an aberration. 
Q: Right. 

A: Because -- because, as you know, the basic Je
wish theology is base
d on interpretation of 
books and of -- of commentary, etce
tera, etcetera. I™m not autho 
-- an authority on it, but I™m 
simply pointing out that W
ilno had that tradition. 
Q: Right. 
A: And in the post-war period, in some  ways, if
 you like analogies [indecipherable] in a sense 
like -- like Berlin in the Weimar days, in this ve
ry short period between Versailles and Hitler, it 
was -- was really a center of -- of 
a lot of culture, and [indecipherabl
e] in the Jewish world really 
was it. Between ™18 and -- and ™39 in this [inde
cipherable] period, it wa
s a lot of young poets, 
you know, K-Kovner and all -- all kinds
 of others, and -- and writers
, and -- and idealogues of all 
kinds, I mean it had every political moveme nt fr
om -- from the Agudas Yisroel, which was the 
very -- the very Orthodox political moveme nt, a
nd it was a political move me nt alongside to the -
- through all the variations for Zionist move me nt
s, up to and including the Bund, which was a -- 
a social democratic labor move me nt with -- with
 very strong trade unions and so on, with a very 
active political life because, for instance, th
e boards of [indecipherable], the boards of the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
5 
 
 
communities were boards that were  el ected in politi
cal -- in political  campaigns. There were fi ve 
parties or six parties, or whatever it is, th
roughout Poland. And -- and so th-there was a very 
lively, active -- active youth move ment
 of all kinds, and -- and -- 
Q: So your life was a very full one when you lived there?  
A: Absolutely. 

Q: What was -- what was your family
 like?  What did your father do? 
A: My father was the head of the j -- of the singl
e -- of the one Jewish hospital in Wilna. And our 
apartment was on the top floor of that hospital. 
So as a child I would -- 
I would look out in the 
windows and see -- and see patients walking ar
ound in the courtyard [indecipherable] and -- 
Q: Did every religious group have their own hos
pital?  Why was there a Je-Jewish hospital? 
A: No, no, no, defin -- no, besides, you should know th
at Jewish communal life 
in contrast to this 
c-country was an organized -- the Jewish kehi
lla -- the Jewish commun
ity was an organized, 
legal entity, like in Germany, for 
instance, the Geme inde was an en
tity under public law, and it -- 
and it had the border directors, or -- or wa -- the 
equivalent , which was elec ted in these political  
elections. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: And dic -- and dic -- and the kehilla and the 
co-community had institu
tions; it ha -- it had 
orphanages, it had -- it had all types of ins
titutions. The hospital in-i nter estingly enough was 

created, I guess, and born as a Jewish hospita
l, I don™t know how far back. But it was a -- a 
hospital which was also a municipal hospital. In
 other words, it was unde
r the -- the -- the 
Departme nt of Heath of the municipality. 
But it was known as th
e Jewish hospital. 
Q: Wa s your father a doctor, or
 -- no. He was -- admi nistrator. 
A: No, he was -- admi nistrator. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514

Q: And -- and did you mother work as well? 
A: Not -- not by the time I was born. She was -- she 
was traine d as a teacher. You also have to 
re-reme mbe r that my pa rents were a generation th
at was educated in Russian schools. Their -- 
their language of, let™s say of academic educati
on or professional education was Russian. Think 
about it. until 1917, Ru-Russia, or [indecipherable] 
whenever it was, untillet™s say, the -- the end 
of 1916, the beginning of 1917, when the -- the revol
ution started and the Russian armi es were 
pulling eastward, Wilna was -- was under Russian 
rules for -- for -- for over a hundred years. 
Q: Right. 

A: Goes back to the [indecipherable] 

Q: Right, right. 

A: -- goes back to the end of the 18
th
 century. 
Q: So what language did you speak at home? 

A: Mostly Yi ddish. 
Q: Uh-huh. 
A: Although my parents would have a tendency natura
lly so -- also to -- oc
casionally to fall back 
into Russian, but -- but Yiddish was -- Yiddish 
was really the language
 of that -- of the 
population. 

Q: Right. 

A: Of the Jewish popul
ation [indecipherable] 
Q: And wha t  was your father™s name ? 

A: Solomon. 

Q: Solomon ?  

A: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514

Q: And your mother? 
A: Leah. 

Q: Leah. 

A: Leah, L-e-a-h. 

Q: And you -- you had a brothe
r who was older or younger? 

A: I had a brother who was much older than I was, and -- 

Q: Much older? 

A: Yes, well, he was eight years older than I wa
s, and -- and that was it. There [indecipherable] 
there were two children the -- the -- the f -- it 
was -- what was -- what do we call it now, a 
nuclear fami ly? 

Q: The nuclear family of four, right. And were
 most of your friends Jewish?  Did you live in a 
Jewish neighborhood? 

A: Yes. I would say that -- I w
ould say that I hardly had any n
on-Jewish friends. I mean, I have 
known non-Jews because people in th -- in the sta
ff of the hospital, and -- and nurses and doctors 
and so on. We had very good and friendly relations 
with -- with people, but
 -- yet they were not 
social relations, they were essentially sort of -- 
I mean, I was the son of the -- of the boss of the -- 
the hospital and there, of course, as a kid, I 
-- I -- I moved around, and the -- the people around 
and everybody was -- certainly the pe
ople were -- of course we ha
d the -- we had the ma id and 
we had the cook and we had whatever. 

Q: You did? 

A: Oh yeah, they were 
-- these were non-Jews. 

Q: So you were fairly well off, or was this typical, to have a ma id and a cook? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514

A: We ll, I would say by today™s standards, I wo
uld say it was upper mi ddle class. I me an, it was 
not where -- it was -- it wa
s not businessman™s wealth. 
Q: Right. 
A: I mean, he was a salaried person, but, fact
 he was relatively well,
 by the standards -- 
Q: Standards. 

A: -- of the time , compe nsated, and -- and the ap
artment that we had was an -- was an apartment 
which -- which he had as part of -- of his job. 
That was on -- it was part of hospital property. 
Q: I see.  

A: It was the top floor of one of the wings of the -- 

Q: Wa s it big?  Did you have your own bedroom? 

A: [indecipherable] yes, of course, we had thr
ee -- we had three bedrooms and we had the living 

room, and we had the sa -- 

Q: Two bedrooms or three? 
A: Three. 
Q: Three, so ea -- s -- uh-huh. 

A: And we had the [indecipherable] which wa
s going -- which was going, I would say 18 hours a 
day -- 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- but I grew up with -- with [indecipherable]
 which was -- which came from an old fashioned 
[indecipherable] with the essence of tea on top. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
9 
 
 
A: Which was as black as black 
ink was. But was hot water which 
was there all the time, and th-
th-this charcoal that kept it going. And you turn on
 this thing and you break a piece of the sugar 
and throw it into -- 
Q: And throw it in?  Did you have favorite foods 
when you were growing up?  You don™t re -- you 
don™t remember. 

A: I don™t -- I don™t remember th -- I was --  

Q: Did you like school? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Where™d you -- what -- what subjects 
did you like in partic
ular?  Do you know? 
A: We ll, th -- I like languages, I like histor
y. I was not a -- I wa s not a -- a gr -- a great 
[indecipherable] but I -- I s -- I 
-- I actually did very well in 
school, I mean, I was no, in that 
respect -- 

Q: So you were serious as a kid? 
A: De-De-Dead serious. 
Q: Dead serious.  

A: That™s true.  

Q: We re you close with your fa mil
y, with your mother and father? 
A: Oh yes, yes. We  were -- we were a close fa
mily and there --  reme mber with -- in a family 
where -- where you have a -- an -- 
an eight year interval betw
een the two children, the youngest 
child almost ends up growing up as a -- almost as a child by him -- by himself. 

Q: Yeah, yes. 

A: I mean, the big brother -- I -- I mean, if I wa
s five -- when I was five he was already 13 or 12 
or whatever it was. I don™t
 think the [i ndecipherable] 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
10 
 
 
Q: So it was a big gap between you. 
A: So that, you know, so the parents -- at a cer
tain point, parents concentrate on the baby when 
the baby is a baby.  

Q: Right. 

A: And I -- I was -- I guess it was ki nd of natural,
 maybe because of the environment, because I 
don™t know what the notion was, that -- that I was to
 st -- to study me dicine. That was the notion. 
Q: That wa -- but, was that 
yours, or that was your dad™s? 

A: I don™t know, I th -- I sort of 
-- I sort of soaked it up as --  
Q: Being in the hospital, I guess, huh? 

A: I guess so and -- and y-you should know that 
Poland had a serious in
stitutionalized anti-
Semitism as far as higher education is concerne
d. It had what was almost offi cially called 

[indecipherable] clauses. A quota system. I don™
t know why I should complain about, Harvard 
had a quota system too, as -- as you know. 
Q: Right. 
A: Otherwise Brandeis and -- and 
-- and Einstein School of Medi
cine probably don™t be ex -- in 
existence. But it was very sharp, and it was sh
arp at the point that, you know, Poland has a 
tradition like Germany [indecipherable] this st udent 
associ ations with -- with -- with their hats 
and their going back to [indecipherabl
e] there, they were called -- 
Q: With capes and stuff, right? 

A: Exactly. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: And they were very militant anti-Semitic st
udent groups in Polish universities, who were 

trying to compel -- particularly
 after Hitler came to power, in
 the 1930™s, which was the time 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
11 
 
 
clause that -- if I was born in
 ™22, so my -- my hi gh school period, or gymnasium, as it is called 
in Europe -- 
Q: Was -- right, was that -- 

A: -- and in Poland was -- was in the 30™s, obviou
sly, in the mi ddle 1930™s and -- and so on, were 
-- were pr etty openly and aggressi ve anti-Semitic, and they were tryi ng to compel the student s to 

sit on the left  side of the classrooms. And 
the Jewish students obviously [indecipherable] 
rebelled against it, and ended up standing in the 
back of -- of lecture 
halls for hours and so on. 
And mi ddle class and upper mi ddle class families 
that wanted their -- their sons and daughters 
who -- I guess primarily sons maybe, but sons
 and daughters to get academic education, 

particularly in medicine and other th
ings, would send these students abroad. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Students were sent to -- to 
Bologna to study me dicine. It-Italy
 was quite apparently open in 
that respect, and -- and 
so on and so it -- it -- 
Q: Did you stand in the back? 

A: I didn™t. You have to figure out 
in -- by 1939, I was only 17 years old. 
Q: Right, so you weren™t 
at the [indecipherable] 
A: I just -- I just -- 

Q: Yes. So it didn™t happen inthe high school?  In the gymnasium? 

A: The gymnasium was a Jewish 
-- was a Jewish run gymna sium. 
Q: Uh-huh, right, right. 

A: It was -- it was under the public school system,in other words it had to meet a proper series of 

-- of subjects and examinations which had to be
 taken in order to obtain what was called a 
matura, which was called the certificateof graduation of -- of the gymnasium. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
12 
 
 
Q: Right, right. 
A: Matura [indecipherable] Latin
 terms o-of -- of ma turation. 
Q: Right.  

A: And I think it™s still called ma
tura if I™m not mistaken, in -- 
Q: I think so. 

A: -- in those part
s of the world. 
Q: I think so. 

A: And -- and that was k-kind of -- eventually th
e equivalent of -- probably of junior college 
here, or some thing like that. A-Anyway, so it -- 
th-then the war broke out in September of ™39, 
and Poland was -- was divided that like 
all in three parts within two parts. 
Q: Two parts, right. 

A: And Stalin took over everyt
hing east of the Bug river,
 including -- including obviously, 
eventually Wilna and -- and -- 
Q: Right. 
A: -- and the Baltic stat es and -- and it was at th
at  point that Wilna was shifted onto Lithuania, 
going back to its historic roots and so on, we don™
t have to lose time on that at the mo me nt.  

Q: Wa s -- did your father retain his job? 

A: Yes. 

Q: After the war?  But -- 

A: This -- this -- the --  my father retained -- reta
ined the job and I was still
 there in -- only in a -- 
in a transitional peris -- stage, because [indeciphe
rable] a few months after the end of the war, 
my fa mily and so on deci ded that  --  that -- that  
I will not be able to pursue proper education and 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
13 
 
 
so on, and -- and we had fa mily and relatives in 
this country, and then -- 
and we were able to -- 
to arrange for me  to be able to -- to get out. 
Q: Did you want to leave?  Do you reme mber? 

A: Did I want to leave? 

Q: Yeah. I mean, you were 17 or 18 years old, right? 

A: Yeah, I mean, there was -- there was -- I mea
n, there was the fa -- the fa mily -- the fa mily 
thought that -- that you know, this 
is gonna be a -- a period of tim
e we™re in -- let you put it this 
way, I grew up in the -- in the atmosphere wh
ere people would go to -- to -- to Italy for 

[indecipherable] difference about go
ing to the United States and It
aly, but the idea that -- that 
you went to -- to get your professi
onal education abroad, in Jewish
 mi ddle class families was not 
such a very strange concept.  

Q: [coughing] Excuse me, but -- excuse
 me , but Italy is much closer. 
A: Oh, of course, yeah [indecipherable]  
Q: You were going to go to the United States -- 
A: Re me mb er, it was also -- these were time s of 
war, we didn™t know. It was a very un -- a very 
un -- unsettled [indecipherable] 

Q: Right, right.  

A: -- the whole time . Was not an easy decision, but it was ma de. 

Q: It was made. So how did your f -- but, did your 
father have to get permission for you to leave? 
A: At that point you could still -- 
it was still under -- if 
you look at it there was a -- a very limited 
time period where Lithuania was still a -- a sort 
of -- th-the Soviets didn™t completely at once 
move in with -- with full blast. The -- the -- th
e embassies and the -- and the consulates and all 
this were still around, and -- a
nd you could travel eastward. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
14 
 
 
Q: But not westward, obvi
ously. Westward was -- 
A: We stward you certainly didn™t travel. 
Q: Right. So you -- you were going to take a huge trip. 

A: Right. 

Q: Yes?   

A: But I wasn™t alone, I mean, there were -- there 
were other people, not --
 not -- not thousands, 
but there were people who -- you kn
ow, I wasn't  the -- the only Je
w with -- with relatives and -- 
and -- and visas to -- to get out of -- of 
-- of Wilna, or of -- or of Lithuania. 
Q: And was that fairly easy to ge
t the visa to come  to the United 
States in 19 -- this is 1940, yes? 
A: I mean, it was -- it was it --  that the tail e
nd of ™39 there, it was 
the early part of -- 
Q: Of ™40. 

A: -- of ™40. I cannot tell you exact
ly the -- you know, the -- the -- the 
-- the me chanics of it, but -
- 
Q: Right. Did you travel with any of your fr
iends?  Did you know some  of these people? 
A: No, I mean I -- I™ve go -- you know, you meet people -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: -- you meet people on trains and so on. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And I mo ved along with -- I go
t to know people, and it™s just
 a long trip. Y-You see, you go -- 
you go on the trains, eventually you go on th
e Trans-Siberian railroad and so on. 
Q: And then you went to Japan? 

A: To Japan. 

Q: And then to the United States. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
15 
 
 
A: By ship. 
Q: By ship 

A: Wa s that ship. Took quite awhile. 

Q: How long did it take you?  Four w
eeks, three weeks, five weeks? 
A: No, I had to wait in Japan for th -- because, you know, ships, I cannot tell you, I -- I have -- I 

didn™t do any research, I only know that I had to
 wait for awhile. Maybe there wasn™t much 
passenger traffic, or ma ybe there was traffi
c and there weren™t too ma ny seats and so on. 
Q: Right. 

A: But eventually I -- I -- I got -- I got -- I went by
 ship to -- to -- to west coast, I™m trying to 
think now which it really was kind of 
strange, I think it was Sa n Francisco. 
Q: You think it was San Francisco? 

A: Yeah. 

Q: Probably was. 
A: Yeah, yeah. And then of course I we
nt across by railroad to -- to New York. 
Q: And that™s where you had relatives? 
A: Sure. 

Q: And were these relatives on your mo
ther™s side or your father™s side? 
A: Father™s side. 

Q: Your father™s 
side. A brother? 

A: No, these were -- these were actually --  these 
were actually cousins and but they we re -- they 
were close, very close and it wa
s very wonderful for me  bec a use 
I was really received with --

Q: Yes. 
A: In the Bronx. 

Q: In the Bronx. 

A: Right. 

Q: That was quite an entry I can imagine. 

A: Oh, the Bronx, reme mber the Bronx in those 
days was. if you still go to the Bronx, if you 
know New York -- 

Q: Yeah. 

A: One of the ma jor area, which is as -- as big 
as the Champs-Elysée or Broadway was called the 
Grand Concourse. 

Q: Right, right. 

A: And the Grand Concourse was a Jewish mi ddle 
class s-section of New York in the -- in the 
1940™s and the 1930™s. 
Q: Right. 
A: That was still a time when Harlem was 
-- had a -- had a sizeable Jewi sh mi ddle class 
population. Yeah? 

Q: We  have to change the tapes. 

A: Okay.

Beginning Ta pe Two 
Q: When you came to the United States, did you speak English? 
A: No. 

Q: No. So did you speak Yiddish with your fa mily? 

A: I spoke Yiddish. 

Q: And how long did it take you to learn English? 

A: I don™t know, I -- I th
 -- I th -- not -- not too long, certain
ly took -- to -- to communi cate. I 
think that I have an ap-aptitude  for languages. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- I -- I ca -- I seem to be able to absorb it 
because subsequently when I was in the Air Force, 
and there was a sign down there, and that was specia
lized training for to -- to study Russian for -- 
for eight mo nths. I loved it and I to -- and to this
 day we empl oy a lot of -- of Russian refugees 
and -- and I have no problem understanding them. I sp
eak -- they tell me th
at I -- that I speak 
rather freely and so on, so -- 

Q: Huh. 

A: It™s -- 

Q: Did you start school fairly quickly? 

A: I™ll tell you where the -- what 
-- what happened was, first of a
ll I wa -- by the time I arrived it 
was already, I guess mi d -- mi d-1940 because I -- 
there was a layover in -- in -- in Japan for 
awhile, and def -- for quite awhile, for a number of
 months, I was simply w
ith -- with the family 
and -- and just -- just -- just fi
nding my way, in a sense, and that
 was very good because I didn™t -
- I didn™t have to -- to -- to 
worry about, you know, about what just -- by just surviving, or living, 
or whatever it was. And for awhile during the -- 
during a period where I was sort of, in my mi nd 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
18 
 
 
th -- th -- and also in my mi nd of
 the -- of the relatives, the idea 
was that -- that I should have a 
year or more just to -- to get 
command of the language and so 
on and not be plunged into a -- and 
it was interesting, I grew -- you know, I graduate
d from a school where Yiddish was a -- was one 
of the ma jor languages in Yiddish literature. An
d they -- I got to know people in New York who 
had -- and there were -- there were
 si -- Yiddish Sunday schools in
 the Bronx and in areas like 
this. And some body introduced me  to some  of thes
e people, and I started 
earning a bit of money 
by -- by teaching kids in the -- you 
know, th-they had these -- just
 as they have Hebrew, quote, 
Sunday schools, which are not always Sunday schools, some times they were We dnesday and 
Sunday mornings. 

Q: Right.  

A: And I started just making some little money out 
of this, you know, just to -- when at the sa me  

time, of course trying to develop my -- my Eng
lish language skills and so on. And that, believe it 
or not, dragged into ™41. It ki
 -- dragged into -- it was a period
 of actually a
bout -- it ended up 
being about 18 -- 18 mo nths or so. Then ca -- 

Q: Uh-huh. And during this time you™re living with your relatives? 

A: Yes, and then came Pearl Harbor. 

Q: Right. 

A: And shortly thereafter I --  I went into service. 

Q: You -- so you enlisted? 

A: Yeah. I was -- I™ve -- I™ve also -- you also ha
ve to know that by that time, June 21, 1940 wa -- 
one occurred. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
19 
 
 
A: An-And the -- the Germans inva
ded -- attacked the Soviet Uni
on, which me ans they -- within 
-- within a week they were in Wilna. A
nd they were [indecipherable] cut off.  
Q: So that must have been very scary. Had you 
been receiving letters from your parents before? 
A: Yeah, I mean, there was a ki-ki-ki -- ma il was -- ma il was still going -- going across from -- 
by that time -- I mean, that part was already under 
Soviet control, but that doesn™t stop a postcard 
which would -- which essential -- es
sentially would come  in Russian to my -- to my aunt, I guess 
it would be, to my fa-father™s cousin. 

Q: Right. 

A: Wh- Who also grew up in Russian
, you know, i-in Russian schools, you -- 
Q: Right, right, right. 

A: She came  to this country, let™s say in -- in
 -- in 1912, or some thing 
like that, so she -- so 
whatever education she had was -- was in Russian. 

Q: Right. 
A: So she would get postcards in -- in -- in
 -- in Russian and some ti me s it would come in 
Yiddish and so on. 

Q: So it -- th-the postcard w
ould ma ke the same  trip that you did. You went up -- 
A: Yes. 

Q: -- it went to the east [i ndecipherable] 

A: -- a-and don™t forget it -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- after a -- after awhile it 
came with Russian postage stamps. 
Q: Yes, yes. 

A: And wi-with s-sa -- with -- 
with s -- s -- S-Soviet stamps. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
20 
 
 
Q: Why did you decide to enlist, do you think? 
A: [indecipherable] I reme mber by -- a day, it wasn™t
 very long after -- afte
r June, July and so on, 
of -- of ™41, that -- that -- that 
there -- there™s a lot of -- a lot 
of the ugly th-things began seeping 
out, and -- and it looked lik
e Hitler was just going to -- to ru
le the world. It was after the London 
blitz, it was after all 
kinds of things, I mean, I cannot 
-- it ca -- ca -- ca -- ca -- cannot 
[indecipherable] it was -- anyway, I don™t consider 
myself a -- what shall I say, a great hero in 
that sense, I mean it was -- if I would have -- 
I would a -- I assume if I would have waited a-
another six months, I would have probably been 
in -- drafted anyway, but I mean, th -- I™m not 
trying to -- to -- to -- to ma ke a
nything special out of it, but it was in some way to me  it was very 
clear that -- that I cannot just
 si-sit around in New York, and -- and -- and go into a -- into 
university and -- and -- and -- and so on, like -- 
like -- like where I came from didn™t matter any 
more.  

Q: Right. Were your -- were your 
relatives upset that you enliste
d, or were they supportive, do 
you think? 

A: They were supportive, I mean -- 

Q: They were. 

A: -- I mean, it was -- it was -- I woul d say -- I 
wa s going to say it was always a ma tter of course. 
Of course, nothing at this st
age was a matter of course. 

Q: Yeah, right. 

A: And it was actually, I mean, between -- between 
-- it was in -- I guess by the -- by the time all 
the -- from relatives and everything 
else, it must have been the -- 
the late spring of ™42, or be 
June or somewhere like that. And -- and th
en you know, starts basic training, and -- 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
21 
 
 
A: -- and combat conditioning and on and on a
nd on and on. But one nice day some thing very 
unusual happened to me . 
Q: What? 

A: I was pulled out from whatever my unit was,
 I was in -- in Missouri some where, in -- in 
covert conditioning training, which 
is -- which wa s just great fun. 
You get into a foxhole and you 
bend your head and a tank rolls over you so that 
you would get used to it.
 And -- but anyway, I 
was pulled out and given orders to
 report to -- to a unit in the 
campus of Syracuse University, 
period. I arrived there, a
nd the -- and I reported to a unit that 
was a s -- an office with a -- a small 
office with a junior officer and a sergeant over 
there, and there were another 14 or 13 or 14 
young me n, and we were assigned to an army sp
ecialized training progr
am to study Russian. I 
had no idea why. It was under -- it 
wa s under the auspices of the Air Force. And we we re -- 
everything was done in the army formation, wh
e r e we ma rched into a classroom, the door 
opened up and the lady walked in, and she said, 
my na me  is Ekatarina Yavonavapastrahova, and 
this is the last English word you™ll hear from
 me . This was the beginni
ng of the army™s total 
imme rsion program, wha t  the Israel
is now call the [indecipherable] 
Q: Right. 

A: Or what Berlitz calls what
ever, total immersion. What turn
ed out subsequently, because I 
didn™t know exactly where -- where it was leadin
g to, but subsequently, I think in Averell 
Harrima n™s me moirs or some where -- he was our am
bassador to the Soviet Union, there is that 
whole business of the U.S. Air Force wanting to
 get permission to land our heavy planes from 
southern England into Poltava, into
 --  into the Ukraine, so that  ther e could be deeper penetration 
into Germany. And Stalin being his 
paranoid dictator as he wa s, resi
s -- resisted it very much, he 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
22 
 
 
didn™t want. Every foreigner was a spy by definiti
on, including half of hi
s [indecipherable] was a 
spy as well as, you know?  He killed 
them off one after the other. 
Q: Right. 
A: But what we -- we were being trained, 
obviously, to be the lia
ison unit on the -- on the 
ground. And for eight months it was a fantastic expe
rience to this day for me, because she was a 
fi rst rate teacher, she was the wife of a white 
Russian diplomat of the League of Nations, they 

were in -- after 1917 they were in, you know, fr
om -- from Russia. And they ended up in -- in 
Geneva, with the League of Nations. By 1940 I assume  things got uncomfortable for them, so 

they ma de their way to the United States and sh
e got a job with the army, teaching -- the army 
taught languages of every possibl
e language. The army taught -- ta
ught Filipino dialects and so 
on be-because that™s to enable -- but in our 
case it™s was a -- we were supposed to be an 
underground liaison unit and it was a very intere
sting experience because in addition to the 
language and in addition to subjecting us to have 
to -- to learn the bible of the Soviet political 
party, which is called the history 
of the Communist party of the -- 
of the USSR, as they called it, 
which was in [indecipherable] Russian, she taught 
us literary Russian, an
d she taught us Russian 
history. So a -- a-after 18 and 
a half months, one nice day the 
door opened up and this lieutenant 
told us the program is finished, no explanati
on. In wartime in the army you get no explanation, 
you get orders. We  were shipped off to a -- to s 
-- north -- G-Greensboro, No
rth Carolina, as a -- 

Greensboro is either in North Ca
rolina or South Carolina, you™ll ha
ve to correct me  on that one. 
And this was a big staging area and we was 
shipped off to southern England and by the 
beginning of May of 1944, I was in southern Engl a
nd with probably close to a million or so of 
other American troops, getting ready for the invasi
on. And as I was in the Air Force, I was lucky, 
I never got my feet wet. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
23 
 
 
Q: Yeah. 
A: On -- on -- on [indecipherable] three I was fl
own over from southern England to Nor mandy. 
And I was assigned to a -- what 
was called a fighter bomber unit, 
which is a -- a 
u -- a unit of 
planes with a single pilot. On
e pilot wou -- cou-c
ould dive-bomb to give close support to 
infantry. So we were always 10 kilome ters
 behind the infantry people, who were -- 
Q: We re you flying? 

A: No. 

Q: No. 

A: I was, I ga ther because of my language training
 and so on, I must have been classified in there 
for s-something to do with Intelligence. 

Q: I see. 

A: So I was assigned to the Intell
igence unit of that par
ticular fighter bomber unit in th -- in -- in 
the Air Force. And my job was to brief the pilo
ts every morning on whatever mi ssions they had, 
and that was it. And y-y -- don™t know when [indeci
pherable] airfields and we had at that time  
still a segregated army. The black engineers we
re there 24 hours ahead of us, and they leveled 
off the [indecipherable] of Nor man
dy. And later on a temporary airf
ield consisted of heavy me tal 
rolls, and which -- which gave traction to the -- to
 the planes when they landed. But of course, 
Nor mandy is also -- has a lot of clay, so when
 it rained the me tal would sink and our planes 
would flop over, but we always
 had enough trucks and [indeciphe
rable] and so on, that that 
wasn™t -- anyway, we were --
 we -- I was fro m -- fro m [i nd
ecipherable] three onward with -- 
with the -- with the whole invasi
on of Nor mandy, and we -- we had 
some experiences, but that™s 
-- I am n -- I am not -- and I don™t belong to the wa
r veterans, who are busy 
talking about their -- 
their army exploits. Anyway, it was -- I went 
through the whole business 
and we had some  tough 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
24 
 
 
times because in the begi nning the Luftwaffe stil
l was very strong, and they would -- they would 
try to bomb the -- the beaches, because in order to
 be able to supply the forces, the beaches had 
to be lit up 24 hours a day, but they had tremendous anti-aircraft protection. But we were -- but 
we were -- be 10 kilome ters behind, deeper into 
the country. We did not ha
ve all this protection, 
so whatever they couldn™t drop on the beaches, 
they dropped on us. But -- but obviously I -- I 
survived, and most of us did. Th
e pilot -- the pilots is anot her 
story. And -- and then we  -- we 
broke through and we went through France and th
rough the Battle of the Bulge and sa w all these 
other things that you can read in 
the -- in the history of that pe
riod, and we -- then we inc -- w-we 
got into Germany, and -- and we went all the way, as
 I said you, to the Elbe river, waiting for -- 
Q: Directions.  

A: -- directions to come . 

Q: Right. So were you actually fighting in certain 
areas, or were you just -- not just, but you were 
vulnerable to being bombed? 
A: We ll, I™ll tell you e-exactly that an Air For
ce unit is in the airfield
 with planes, which are 
being fueled up and ma i ntained -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- all the time. They go out on mi ssions. Thei
r mi ssions are to provide support the infantry 
which means they -- they have to attack whatever moves on the other side of -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- whatever the front line is. And they come  
ba ck, and they have to 
report on what they doing, 
these reports have to go back. We  are also being 
the most forward th -- A- American ai rfield who 
are on the receiving end of
 all the big planes that were co
mi ng back with dead and wounded on 
it. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
25 
 
 
Q: Mm. 
A: Because th-the -- the -- the -- I™m s orry, I ca
n™t -- I can just that I ca
n tell you I don™t want to 
talk about it, it -- basically the heavy bombers, th
ey were huge planes with four engines and they 
had ma ybe e i ght -- eight or nine crews of -- per --
 per plane. And they w
ould fly in -- in -- in 
waves of several hundred at a time , to protect eac
h other and so on agains
t fight [indecipherable] 
against the Luftwaffe and so on. And they w
ould go into German c
ities and factories and 
whatever it is, and -- and bomb them, that™s what
 they did. When I eventu
ally -- after the war I 
had to fly in from Frankfurt to Berlin, I coul
d look into the basement
 of every building.  
Q: Yes, right.  

A: Cause we ma naged to -- to bu
rn through every -- every -- now, of course they, ma ny of them 
would have to go back dama ged, for when the 
aircraft and the people wounded and dead over 
there, it is probably the nearest ai
r -- airfield, so it is -- they 
would come  back, they would put 
out flares, and we would know whe t her we were 
dead or wounded or whether there™s a serious 
mechanical problem. They would land at our airfiel
d because  we were the closest. We were not 
the only ones, all of these close report fighter unit
s were along the front lines in these pl aces, part 
of which I was to debrief them and so on. 

Q: I see.  

A: During the Battle of the Bulge, we were physica
lly attacked by the Luftwaffe, this -- this was 
[indecipherable]. And we had to, of course, protect 
ourselves as we did in s -- and then they were 
shot down and I had to be involved in the interr
ogation of them and so on, but this is what you 
did. 

Q: Cause you were fluent in German also? 

A: Oh, that helped. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
26 
 
 
Q: Yeah, yes. 
A: A -- very -- 

Q: Yes, if you were going to do interrogation, right? 

A: The funny part of the -- of the German was in 
-- in that particular e-episode, which is a very 
fa mous one if you read the -- the history of the Batt
le of the Bulge in Decem
ber, that was the last 
attempt German General Rundstedt would try, th
ey thought they could r
eally break through and 
go to the -- and they gave us a rough time , and 
it was -- you -- you™ll -- y
ou™ll read about it if you 
read that history. They surrounded a -- wa
 -- one of the fa mous paratroop units, 101
st
 airborne 
and so on, and we were -- th-the 
unit was totally surrounded, you can 
read all about it. And th-the 
German general send the -- a unit with the right flag
 to talk to the -- to 
the general who is the 
head of the airborne th-t
hat th-th-they should surrender, and th
e great joke was, and that™s a fact, 
h-he -- he said -- he told whoever was on our si
de, he™s -- who was only a German, he said, tell 
him in English, nuts to their offer. And the joke
 was literally that the 
-- th-the -- the Germans 
went back and translated that into nusa, mean
ing nuts are to eat, and they didn't know what the 

hell he was [i ndecipherable] was, but -- but basica
lly what I™m trying to te
ll you basically is that 
that was -- that was the grimme st part of it. 

Q: Right. 

A: And they dropped paratroopers in American 
uniforms, consisting of -- of American high 
school graduates whose parents were 
part of the Germ
an American Bund. 
Q: Right. 

A: And in the 1930™s they were -- you know -- 
you know, there were rallies of the German 
American Bund, 20,000 strong in the -- in the ca -- Ma
dison Square Garden. And some of them -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
27 
 
 
- and some  of them e mi grated to -- to Nazi Germany, and t ook their teenage children with them, 
who spoke fluent -- they were 
am -- American kids, they -- 
Q: Right, right. 

A: -- they have no accent, nothing. Some  of those were mobilized and put into American 

uniforms by the Germans and dropped as paratroopers
 behind our lines and 
did a lot of da ma ge.  
Q: Hm. 

A: We  had among our people German Jewish refug
ees with German accents as thick as -- as a 
knockwurst, and -- and th -- and the MP™s who 
became aware of this business started stopping 

Jeeps along the way, and suddenly they would pick up some body with a heavy Germa n accent, 

so that they would take him in
to an MP -- military police stockade, and we would get a call, 
telephone call, do you have a Hans Rosenfeld in
 your unit? If you do, then you better come  and 
bail him out. But that was all part of -- of the -- 
that was the last big epis
ode that -- we had some  
casualties obviously, but then
 the war came to an end. 
Q: We re -- were you during this period hearing 
about what the -- the Germans were doing in 
occupied terr itory with Je ws and with
 others, that  ther e was mass killing? 
A: Oh, we were totally dependent upon some thi
ng which was the -- the -- the aring -- the army 
newspapers. 

Q: The ﬁStars and Stripe sﬂ? 

A: The g -- ﬁStars and St ripesﬂ, and the radios. 
And they reported whatever was reportable, but 
what we saw, of course, was moved into 
Germany, and we began liberating, you know, these 

towns and so on, we begin to see people out of 
the labor camps, and then  walking on the streets 
with -- with -- with peop
le who -- who -- who turned to us an
d -- and -- and so on, that we -- we 
knew. We  -- we -- we saw what was going on, plus 
-- plus a -- obviously th-th-thin -- the ﬁStars 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
28 
 
 
and Stripesﬂ had quite a few repor
ts. I di -- I knew one thing which was very important to me  
personally because my father was the only me mber
 of the family who -- who survived, and he 
survived by a fluke. He survived by ending up in eastern Russia. 
Q: Mm. 

A: And -- and fr om time to time he was able to 
send a postcard to my aunt in -- in New York, 
and she would forward it on. So I knew that -- I knew
 that he was alive, but totally cut off from 
Wilna and cut off from the rest of
 the fa mily. That -- that I knew. 
Q: And that you knew at the end of the war. 

A: That I knew even after -- afte
r the Nor mandy landing [indecipherable] 
Q: Uh-huh.  

A: Reme mb er the army delivered mail -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- APO?   
Q: Right. 
A: Ar my  Po st Offi
ce [indecipherable] 
Q: So you were pretty sure that 
your mother and brother were -- we
re probably not alive at this 
point?  Or you -- or you weren™t sure
?  You didn™t know?  You didn™t know.  
A: I mean the -- if you look in retrospect
, there are people who survived Auschwitz. 
Q: Yes. Right. So who knew?  So you™re in Euro
pe -- you™re in Germany when the war ends, is 
that correct? 

A: Right. And the U.S. State Departme nt come
s across -- come s around with a mi ssion to recruit 
young foreign service officers for American
 military governme nt
 admi nistration. 
Q: And you say okay? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
29 
 
 
A: They obviously also must have had some  kind 
of list. Wh ether it had 
to do with -- with my 
background by now, I have no idea, but I -- y-you know
, if -- it™s r-really
 peculiar, I -- I don™t 
recall the precise incident. It was at the point  
where it was maybe the end of -- ma ybe  beginning 
of June, something like that. 
Q: 1945. 

A: Right. 

Q: Right. 

A: And the question was, you know, to -- this
 was the beginning of d-do you -- do you get 
shipped to the Far East? After all the war with -- 
with -- in -- with Japan 
was still on, if -- as you 
know, until the mi ddle of August. One didn™t know at
 that time when the war will end, anyway. 
Or whether one will begi n to begi n to be sent 
back home for -- to be de mobilized or whatever. 
And I was approached and I said yes. There was 
-- there was nothing at that point for me  in a 
sense, in a sense, to go back to. 
Q: Right. 
A: All I knew is that my fa ther was so me where in
 -- in the depth of Asia
tic Russia. I was -- I had 
to -- to assume always the worst as far as the re
st of my fa mily is concerned. And in the United 
States other -- other than obvious
ly the -- the -- the warm frie
ndship and so on, of -- of my 
fa mily, I was a -- a lone ranger. 

Q: Right. And now we have to stop the tape. 
End of Tape Two 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
30 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Three 
Q: Did you get discharged from the army when t hey gave you this job? 
A: Yeah. I was -- I was offi cially disc harged 
fr om the army, assigned to military government 
admi nistration and I was -- and I had to travel to
 Frankfurt to report to a unit of the fi nance 
division of the offi ce of military government, U.
S. for short OMGUS, O-M-G-U-S, that was its 
official name, and all of the documents and so o
n. And I was assigned to a 
-- to the -- to the unit 
within the finance division, who was supposed to
 do res-research on the Ge rman banking system 
during the Nazi period, for two purposes. One, 
because the United States military government 
came in with a program of decentralization a
nd -- and decartelization of the whole German 
financial and economic system because that wa
s, of course, also the -- the interlocki ng 
directorates of the banks and big 
industry and so on is a concentrated for -- element and force in -
- in --  in helping the Nazi  regi me to -- to --  to 
prosper and to --  and to the military to be able to. 

And then of course as an instru
me nt subsequently of -- of looti
ng the occupied countries of -- of 
Europe. 

Q: [sneezes]. Excuse me . 

A: Bless you. 

Q: Thank you. 

A: And -- and the other part of it 
is to develop whatever ma terial 
could develop to send to the -- 
to Nuremberg for the worker™s trials, which had ec
onomic elements to it. I mean, the head of the 

Reichsbank, Mr. Schacht, and the Chief Economi c s 
Minister Funk, and the ot
hers were part of 
that -- of the Goering trial, a
nd so on. And it was at that point 
where I began to develop working 
contacts and working relationships with the pros
ecutors in -- in Nurember g, whi -- that led later 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
31 
 
 
on to a very close working relationship in conne
ction with the first re
stitution program in the 
American zone.  
Q: So is that when you me t Ben Fer e ncz? 

A: Ben Ferencz, of course. 

Q: Right. 

A: I mean, in that context -- 

Q: Yes. 

A: -- where we got to know each othe r. 

Q: Yes. 

A: And we -- there -- there were ma ssive reco
rds in a place called Offenbach, which was about 
eight kilometers from -- from the heart of Frankf
urt. My fi rst offi ce in Frankfurt was in the 
building of the Reichsbank branch, which is like
 the Federal Reserve bank. In Frankfurt that 
building is still ther e, and of c
ourse the great luxury that I acquired and fr om which I didn™t want 
to part was a -- was a rocking chai
r. After -- after a coupl
e of years of army se
rvice in a tent in 
other pl aces, the rocking chair was something special
 anyway. But that is what we did for several 
months, and that was also duri
ng the period when the Soviets,
 as you know, would not let the 
American forces into Berlin. Although officia
lly, according to the Alta
 agreement, we were 
supposed to be in Berlin practically from the 
beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months 
to -- to loot, rape and whatever. And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of Frankfurt until the 
beginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military 

governor was -- was already in Berlin. His name
 was General Lucius Clay. And all the other 
military governors were sitting there, and there was,
 at that time still that  instrument which was 

supposed to be the coordinating 
instrume nt, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
32 
 
 
a K, and that had to be -- that was part of 
our of-official vocabulary, 
and -- and I was then 
directed to move from Frankfur
t to Berlin, and I moved there in
 January of 1946. Berlin was in a 
shambles, of course. It was a very cold winter. 
The U.S. army did some  lovely things for the 
civilian population. Had tents on cro
ssings and little islands with ar
my potbelly stoves that were 
going all the time so people could go in and warm
 their hands, which I thought was -- was proper 
huma ne thing to do and -- and -- and we did it.
 In any event, I was then assi gned to the 
Intelligence division of the finance de partme nt, a
nd my first assignment involved the writing of a 
report on the largest of the German ba nks, wh
ich was called the Deutsche bank. The Germans 
had three major banks. They were called the gross bank and the giant banks, 
that was the official 
German terminology. And that was the Deutsc
he bank, the Dresdner bank and the Commerce 
bank. Deutsche is deutsche in German and Dr
esdner is based on the city of Dresden, and 

Commerce is commerce. And they we
re in -- in that order in the 
size, and of course once we -- 
we got into their -- their reco
rds and -- and we interrogated a lo
t of people, and the picture was 
very clear, they -- they -- the first st ep was th
e -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri -- 
right after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came  to 
power, started the remo val of -- of Jews from 

leading positions in the banking sy
stem, both in the -- in the board 
of directors, which was called 
the [indecipherable] and the board of ma nageme nt
, which is called the Vo
rstand. In this way, by 
the way, is -- is with a V, written as a V a
nd pronounced as a V. Vorstand, V-o-r-s-t-a-n-d. They 
removed the Jews, there were -- there were prom
inent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on -- 
on the boards of directors and so on. That was th
e first step of elimination. Then the banks 
proceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of 
-- of ma ny of the private ba nks which were Jewish 
owned. Germany had a -- a -- a whole series, star
ting with the Rothschild banks of course, but 
over the years private banks quite well known, Me
ndelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
33 
 
 
etcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on. [indeciphe
rable] up and down, and with the Aryanization 
of those banks and became  instrume nts of the Ar
yanization of Jewish businesses. And that they 
did very effectively and very e-
e-efficiently between then -- ™
33 and -- and -- and ™38 - ™39. And 
then as -- as the war broke out, and particular 
it star ted fi rst with the anschluss of Austria in 
March of 1938, the Deutsche bank moved in a
nd took over the larges
t Austrian bank. The 
Dresdner bank moved in and took over the second
 largest Austrian bank, called the La nder bank, 
the first one was the [indecipherable], I mean, I -- 
I won™t b-bore you with a
ll this, but yeah, this 
is now what, ™46, we did all this. And -- and so 
-- and so they went when th -- when -- when 
Sudetenland was taken over and subsequently Cz
echoslovakia, the Deutsche bank took over the 
largest -- 
Q: Largest. 

A: -- Czech bank and so on, very systematic, very
 orderly. And there was even a sort of a -- 
became al most like a little rhyme, it -- it rhym
es in German. Zuerst kommen die tanken, first 
come  the tanks, and then kommen die banken, and 
then come  the banks. That rhymes in German, 
obviously, the tanken and banken rh
yme. But it was like [indecipherable] the same  thing applied 
to western Europe. Whe n they move d into Belgium they took the control of the ma jor banks, 

they di -- took control 
in -- in Holland, etcete
ra. And so the first report was the report on the 
activities of the Deutsche bank, and simultane
ously the Dresdner bank w -- very -- it was a -- 
where they -- a special unit, and I was part of
 it, and some where along the way I -- I wa s given 
more responsibility and -- and in some  of 
the subsequent investig
ations, I was the chief 
investigator of it and so on, and in
 any event, the objective of these 
reports was that th-the -- the 
military government had to establish a policy on what is --  what kind of a bank is this 

[i ndecipherable]. One thing was very clear, that  
A, we will not allow a --  a intermingling of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
34 
 
 
banking and industrial corporations
, because the German system, pa
rticular the -- the Nazi period 
is that the ma jor banks ended up being the -- pr
oviding the chairmanships of the main major 
industrial companies. It was a re
al intertwining of interlocking 
directorates, it is called in the 
decartelization world. And in addition to that , we
 came with a tradition of decentralized banking 
in this country. In the state of 
New York at that time , believe 
it or not, Chase Manhattan had no 
right to have a branch in Buffalo. 
Q: Really? 

A: The state of New York was di
vided into banking districts, a
nd if a bank was in Manhattan and 
in the Manhattan district of banking, it could not be
 in Buffalo and it could not be in Syracuse in 
those days. So the whole idea of -- of extrem
e decentralization of banking, very important 
[indecipherable] anyways, but in this case it was 
important not to allow th
e reconstitution of -- of 
the inst ruments which were important  instruments 
in the whol e Nazi pr ogram of -- of -- of -- of 

control and -- and -- and centr
alization of economic power. 
Q: So the research that you 
and your colleagues were doing we
re absolutely essential -- 
A: Of course. 

Q: -- to -- to being able to
 make a decision like that. 
A: Of course. 

Q: Yeah. 

A: A-And we -- and -- and then of course, in 
this process was -- was more than that. These 
people were responsible for -- for economi c war crim
es. This was -- this is called spoliation. This 
is a concept in -- in international law. And -- 
and Aryanization, which wa
s taken -- was carried 
out, financed with the ma jor banks involved the 
periodic arrests of th
e Jewish owners into 
Gestapo jails and say, you know, you either sign or 
-- or you gotta spend the 
rest of your life over 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
35 
 
 
there. And all of this was [indecipherable] it was 
-- it was ma de possible with the funding of -- of 
the banks, of the -- the -- of the banks. And it wa
s not only confined to the big ones, there were 
smaller banks and so on. In any event, subsequently I was assigned and -- and I became  the -- the 
chief of financial Intelligence of
 the U.S. military governme nt for Germany, at -- at a rather 
tender age, but anyway, this is -- 

Q: Yes, you were what, 23 years old, or 24? 

A: No, I was -- I was [indecipherable] by that time in 1948, I was an -- 

Q: Oh. 

A: -- old ma n of -- of -- 

Q: 28. 

A: -- of -- of 26. 

Q: Six, 26, right, a 
real old man. 
A: Look, i -- nothing was known in those days. 
Q: No. 
A: The army  had a rule, I -- I don™t know whet
her the rule applies st
ill today. You get an 
assignment, they throw you in the water. If you swi m, then you -- then you swim and then you 

move. And it ma kes no difference, you™re 26, you™re -- you™re -- you™re 36, if you sink, you™re 

out.  

Q: Right. 

A: Anyway, some body - -  some body decided that -- 
that I didn™t sink. And that -- and in the 

meanti me , of course, other things are -- beca 
-- became very important. The -- in conne -- in 
connection with the whole process of Aryanization and so on, there was very serious 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
36 
 
 
negotiations on the part of the Jewish organiza
tions in Washington. With the -- the -- reme mber, 
military government was under the -- under the War Department.  
Q: Right. 

A: Not the State Departme nt -- 

Q: Not the State. 

A: -- the War Department. 

Q: Right. 

A: Although the State Departme nt had a senior 
political officer, there was General Clay, and 
there was a senior State Departme
nt official as the political o
fficer. But General Clay was here. 
And -- and then negotiations were going on fo
r property restitution, 
the -- there was an 
organization that had to be -- th
e Jewish organizations properly advanced this whole issue. And 

the ma jor battle, and that was -- that was one of 
the great, basic, historic developments, which 
was historic in the whole international law. In th
e norma l, civilized life, if I die tomorrow in the 
state of New York without heirs,
 the state of New York inherits me . You c a n go back to the 
[indecipherable] of 2,000 years 
plus, and you will find the prin
ciple intended for normal, 
civilized societies. The Jewish 
organizations came to the U.S. gove
rnme nt and said, that is not 
acceptable after the extermination of six million Je
ws. The successor -- the su
ccessor state of the 
Third Reich cannot become  the beneficiary of th
e efficiency of their 
extermination program. I 
mean, you c a n go back to the -- to the old Bi
blical expression, you cannot mur-murder and 
inherit. And -- but that wa s a diffi
cult battle, because the battle 
had to be th-the battle with 
international lawyers who said, too bad, this is
 ironclad concept and it cannot be a-any other 
way. And reparations -- reme mber
 historically, if you go back to
 World War I and so on, it was 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
37 
 
 
always an issue between states. The -- the vi ct
or ious state could exact 
reparations from the -- 
from that state wa -- which was defeated, 
but it was always interstate dealings.  
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: Here obviously we were comi ng with -- the 
organizations were comi ng with dema nds for 

restitution programs to individuals, regardless of wh
at their na tionality ma
y be at the -- at the 
mome nt that [indecipherable] had 
to be done, but most importantly 
with respect to the heir list, 
and unclaimed Jewish property, and to the prope
rty of Jewish communities and organizations 
that were obliterated by the Nazi regime , that -- th
at it -- it could not [inde
cipherable] is the legal 
expression is to this -- to the 
state in which the property was lo
cated. That took a long time and a 
long fight, but the Jewish organizations prevailed, and the U.S. government agreed, and the first 

property restitution law was enacted as a Unite
d States military governme nt law number 59, in 

Nove mber of 1947. And in that law there is a 
provision which says, unclaimed property of 
victims of Nazi persecuti
on as defined in the beginning of the 
law, shall accrue to a successor 
organization, which shall use the proceeds fo
r the benefit of the 
class of persecutees. 
Q: Hm. 

A: And this was a genuine revolu
tionary concept and development in international law. And it is 
to the everlasting credit, as far as I™m concer
ned, of the United States government, that stood up 
all by itself, because I™ll tell 
you in a mome nt for how long it st
ood up all by itself. The British 
and the French did not go along initially with th
is concept, and enacted this as valid for the 
Americans [indecipherable] of Germany. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: There was no central governme nt in Germa
ny until the fall of 1949. Be tween ™45 and ™49 
there was no central government. Every military gove
rnor was the absolute ruler of his zone of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
38 
 
 
occupation and this sector of Berlin. And 
there were municipal governme nts, and there 
eventually were state governme nts, you know, Ba
varia and Hassen and whatever. But there was 
no central government until four -- for over four 
years. And in Nove mber of 1947, this law was 
enacted in the American zone of Germany. Amer
ican zone of Germany to give you an idea in 
present day -- day Germany was cities like Fran
kfurt and Munich and Nuremberg and -- and 
Kassel and Bremen as a port, and Stuttgart and etcet
era, I me an it -- it was 
sort of the center of 
the -- the British had th-the -- the industrial he
art of Germany, the whole -- the Düsseldorf and 
Cologne and the coal mi nes and the steel mills 
and so on, and Hamburg. And the French had the 
most western part, bordering on Alsace, and -- on
 Alsatia and Alsace and 
-- and then -- and on 
the lake area and so on, and the Black Forest, th
e Schwarzweld and so on, they had -- they had 
nice countryside, but that -- they, 
of course, were the smallest of the -- of the zones. When that 
was enacted, General Clay wanted the British and 
the French, his counterpa
rts to enact a similar 
law -- laws for their zones so there would be a 
single property restituti
on law in We st Germany. 
The Soviets you could forget about, they were not 
interested in private pr
operty, they were not 
interested in the whole concep
t of compensation and 
restitution and so on. There was nothing to 
talk about with them. The British and the French
 would not go along. Th-This was not in their -- 
the military governors obviously ca -- don™t make 
these decisi ons, the de cisions go back to the 
governme nts. And in the case of the governme nts,
 it of course goes to the foreign office in 
London, and to the [indecipherable] in Paris. Th
e international lawyers 
over there said, no how. 
So General Clay went in and -- and promulgate
d it in the Ame r ican zone, and the Jewish 
organizations established in New York the fi rst si -- Jewish successor or ganization called the 

Jewish Restitution Success Organization, or JRSO for short. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
39 
 
 
A: That was created almost at the same  ti me  
when the law was enacted, it was in the last 
Nove mber of ™47, but it didn™t come
 into real operation until the late spring of ™48 because -- and 
that is very difficult for us imag -- to imagin
e today -- you could not create from the outside any 
kind of an operation in the occupied parts of
 Germany unless you were some how hooked up to 
military government. You couldn™t get housing, 
you couldn™t get access to food, you couldn't -- 
you -- you could not function, ordinarily. So the -- 
the Jewish organizations, primarily the Joint 
Distribution Committee, which wa
s -- had a massive operation in Germany because they were 
running the Jewish Displaced Persons camps. My s-- first cont acts with the Joint were in the 

spring of 1946 in Berlin, because within a month or so when I came to Berlin, I di scovered that 

there was a Jewish Displaced Persons camp in the 
American sector of Berlin called Ze hlendorf. 
So of course I ber -- I ma rched myself over to 
Zehlendorf and I br -- and I me t my J DC friends 
from that point on. And I would go to the army 
post exchange and buy cartons of cigarettes at a 
dollar -- Camels at a dollar apiece, 10 cents a 
pack, and schlep it to the -- to the DP camp 
because that was the currency, the reichsma rk didn™t -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- didn™t mean very much. I had to deliver 
the [indecipherable] she wa s the happiest woma n, 
she would get two ca -- two cartons of Ca me ls a w
eek. She was a rich woma n in Berlin in those 
days. Anyway, so if -- the JDC then was very mu
ch involved in establishing the JRSO, so they 
sent the general consul to the 
-- to -- of the JDC to two peopl
e, to Ben Ferencz in Nuremberg 
who had just finished being the prosecutor of 
the Einsatzgruppen. And 
I don™t have to tell you 
the Einsatzgruppen was the most organized killer or
ganization that went -- 
that went right behind 
the ar -- the German ar my after June 1941, and 
every day would telegr
aph a report, so ma ny 
Jews and so ma ny Bolsheviks, and of course th ey did [indecipherable] and a few other nice 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
40 
 
 
places like that. And -- and he just
 finished his tour of duty -- 
I mean his -- the -- the -- the 
Einsatzgruppen trial, and by the way, hi-his was 
the only trial which sent  the largest nu mber of 
SS officers and generals to the gallows. And 
we -- Ben -- Benny and I know each other from -- 
already from before in terms of -- of the -- of my
 -- my feeding them ma terial on the -- out of the 
economic records. At that point we were bl
ockaded by Stalin. In 
the spring of 1948, Joseph 
Stalin thought that the mo me nt 
has come  to try and push us out 
of Berlin as the beginning of 
pushing us out of Ger many and western Europe
. The Communist parties of France were 
powerful. The Communist parties of Italy were 
powerful, and it was -- economi c conditions were 
terrible. Marshall pl an was just beginning to --  to -- to get into full gear, and Stalin thought this 

was a good mome nt. So he cut off rail access to --
 to -- to We st Berlin, and water access, you 
know, there were canals and so on that would go 
into Berlin. And there 
was -- if you -- if you go 
into the histories, you can read and find that th
ere was serious discussion 
in Wa shington as to 
whether or not the U.S. and the western powers 
should pull out of Berlin and give him -- give 
him -- and give Stalin [indecipherable]. It was Clay who went to Harry Truman and came up 

with the idea  of the airl ift. And 
from that -- and that coincided w
ith some thing el se, I mean that™s 
the reason I say to you that -- that 
some  of the historic context of 
how some  of these things that 
we are talking about [indecipherable] today were
 born, have not been pr
operly and in depth 
researched and put in the proper context. Simu
ltaneously, in order to begin to rebuild the 

economy of -- of West Germany, the allied power
s [indecipherable] when 
they talk about the 
allied powers, you ca -- have to assume  the U.S. be
ing in the lead. The U.S. was in the lead miles 
ahead of everybody else. We  were strongest milit
arily, economi cally, we were [indecipherable] 
as a country, we -- you know, the British and -- a
nd the French and so on were -- were physically 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
41 
 
 
and otherwise exhausted. And a -- the decision was 
ma de to in -- to introduce the deutsche ma rk, 
the idea being that you in
troduce a new currency and you 
build a new economy base. 
Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And the new currency was introduced in J
une of 1948. [indecipherable]
 it takes a year for 
such a decision to be implemented. The first deutsche ma rks were printed by the Ame r ican bank 

note company in the United States. I mean, if you ha
ve to project yourself to -- to this whole time 

-- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- who -- who would anticipated in
 the spri ng of ™48 that St alin will decide to bl ockade us in 
Berlin and we would have to protect the new cu
rrency from falling into the wrong hands. There 
was no Berlin wall at that time, and the Comm
unist party of West Ge
rma ny was swimming in 
reichsmarks. There were Bavarian vi llages th
at never in the Weimar Republic ever had the 
Communist vote, that had a sma
ll Communist party office, because
 when the Soviets moved into 
east Germany and so on, they cleaned out every Ge
rman bank that was there, Reichsbank, and so 
on, and they had railroads full of reichsma rk. 
And although the reichsma rk didn™t have great 
value, but mountains of them would still some  va
lue, and we introduced the ma rk -- the deutsche 
mark and there™s -- and there™s -- 
if you read the papers from th
at time, the hens began laying 
eggs overnight. Suddenly, suddenly goods and th
ings began comi ng up and the economy began 
to -- to -- to develop and so on, a
nd the Soviets were trying desperat
ely to -- to -- to lay their 
hands on this currency. And we had to -- we had 
to run an economy of the western sectors of 
Berlin with a ma jority of the va -- population un
employed, with airlifted co
al and airlifted goods, 
and to keep the -- this economy going, and to pr
otect our currency from -- from being depleted. 
And suddenly I found myself as the chief of fina
ncial Intelligence of m
ilitary government to be 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
42 
 
 
responsible for doing things that nobody has ever
 been taught in the -- in the economics school, 
and never probably taught again. 
End of Tape Three 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
43 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Four 
Q: May I call you Saul? 
A: By all means. 

Q: When -- when we we re talking in between the 
tapes, you started to talk about the fact that you 
thought you were talking too much a bout Saul 
Kagan, about yourself, an
d not about the issue 
that was most important to you. So tell me  what you 
think is the really important issue here, with 
respect to this interview. 

A: As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventu
ally it is subjective be
cause of -- of my own 
immersion in this --  in this whole area. But as I 
-- as I keep thinking over the years that there is 
one area which in my judgme nt is that had b
een fully and properly researched and -- and 
examined, and that is what were 
the particular forces and elemen
ts in the -- in the lil -- late 
1930™s and the early 1940™s that -- that ma de it po
ssible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I 
say organized because unless -- unless some thing is
 organi zed, unless there is some  sort of an 
instrumentality, then it 
is a lot of conversation. Maybe c
onversation is important, yo-you -- you 
ma y not come  to the -- to the action before
 -- be-before you -- befo
re you -- you -- you 
contemplate the problem, but nonetheless, forthe first time  -- and I™m not a professional 
historian, so I say it with all 
these caveats and reservations, but I think it™s the first time where 
the organized Jewish community in this global se
nse has -- has decided, in response to -- to in-
incredible tragedy that  has befalle
n the Jewish people, to -- to conf
ront the perpetrators or -- or 
their successors. Because if I go 
back, at least to the extent  which -- and I have spent obviously, 
time going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster
 and catastrophe in Jewi
sh life, there was an 
event, or events of -- of pers
ecution and of -- and of 
physical dama ging injury and -- and murder 
with the survivors ultimately going into some  kind 
of exile or into some  -- away from wherever 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
44 
 
 
it is, leaving behind all their worldly goods, 
basically, and building 
a new life and a new 
existence and new communities in hope that -- that
 it will not be dest royed or damaged again. 
And you see rip -- that repeatedly but frequen
tly enough, whether you go back to the destructions 
of the temple, the --  the temples of the -- of the 
Ba bylonian period or -- or s -- or subsequently in 
the -- in the Middle Ages, the pogroms and the Cr
usaders and the period about -- which Barbara 
Tuchma n de scribed in -- in -- in some  of 
her books and so on, what you saw was, the Jews 
picked themselves up from the area where the Cr usaders and so on persecuted them. Fortunately 

the kings of Poland wanted -- need
ed craftsme n, and that in -- cr
eated an open door, and the Jews 
were moved from the Rhine area into Poland, et
cetera and a new chapter in Jewish history 
opened up [indecipherable] Jewish community in 
Poland, in eastern Euro
pe and so on. And -- 
and -- and then subsequently came all kinds 
of -- for ms of per s ecu
tion, some  of the m -- 
obviously 1492 in Spain, and again the Jews ran 
and left everything behind and build new lives 
and -- and those who were caught 
by the Inquisition of course, pe
rished. And -- and then came  
the whole si -- mi ddle -- mi ddle of 17
th
 century with the [indecipherable] pogroms. Again the 
same -- the same phenomenon. Persecution, murder
, exile, escape, flight, whatever. I am 
obviously not going into the intricacies, but [indecipherable] that -- 
that™s the picture. And -- and 
even as late as -- as the beginning of the 20
th
 century, with the pogroms 
of [indecipherable] and 
what was the response there?  The ma ssive mi grati
on out of Russia to -- to 
-- to the United States. 
The roots of the vast ma jority of American Jews 
today are the -- the gr-gra
nd -- the grand or gr -- 
or great-grandparents of those who ran from 
the pogroms of -- of -- of
 Tsarist Russia. No-
Nobody dug in their heels and said, we were -- we
 were driven out, we were hurt, we  were 
dama ged, we were persecuted. S-S -- this -- 
this governme nt, or th
is successor governme nt 
cannot get away with this. Now you can say that 
-- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that

Hitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the i
ndustrialized, ma ssive, incredible industrialized 
persecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of
 six million people in -- in fi ve years was so 
earth-shaking and [indecipherable] 
earth-shaking. Some times  I ask myself -- I don™t know, is it -- 
was it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogrom
s for -- for the Jews at that time as great a 
horror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht?  I-I don™t know, I 
can™t -- I can™t judge it. Or -- or -- or  the 
[indecipherable] of a whole people out of the Iberia
n peninsula?  I mean, that
 certainly was not a -
- a local --  a small local event of -- of some pe
ople in the village of [i
ndecipherable] getting cr-
crazy. Now, the other possibility
 is -- is, of course, ma ybe 
by the 1930™s, there were things 
around us at the world at large that -- that estab
lished some  kind of preced
ence, in other words of 
-- of some forms of coll
ective response to some thing. I -- I™
m not sure. The one thing that come s 
to mi nd for instance was the -- was the Armenian
 -- the persecution of the Ar me nians by the 
Turks in 1915, the World Wa r I. I haven™t rese
arched that for myself well enough to know 
whether there was, first of all on the part ofthe Arme nians outside of Turkey, some  or ganized 
effort to attempt to confront the Turkish governme
nt with it. I™m not sure
, at least I™m not aware 
that it was of such open and -- and strong [indeciphe
rable] fashion as I th
ink happened finally in 
-- in the early 1940™s with respect 
to -- to -- to the huma n and ma
terial consequences o-of the 
Holocaust. And that -- and that 
-- I mean, I share a result of -- 
of a layman™s perception of a 
feeling that some thing extra hist
orically, certainly, in my opi nion, 
in Jewi sh history, historically 
some thing extraordinary happened, and then so on. 
And even -- and e -- and it, to me  it would be 
that even be necessarily confin
ed to Jewish history alone. The 
question of a -- of a persecuted 
group which is not represented by a state, that does
 not have an army, that does not have the -- 
the -- the basic indi ces of -- of -- 
of power, has some how developed firs
t -- first -- first agreed or  
begin to -- to -- to find this -- this whole appr
oach, and then -- and then ended up building, if you 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
46 
 
 
will, the infrastruct ure to -- to 
-- to -- to -- to carry it forward 
and to -- and to turn it into 
some thing tangible, for the benefit of the victims ,
 for [indecipherable] th-the victims themselves. 
And -- and -- and that -- that has to be analyz
ed. One has to analyze th
e elements of American 
Jewish history i-in -- in the -- in the 19 -- in the 1
930™s, in Palestine, in -- in -- in -- in how -- in 
how the German Jewish community reacted. In what
 it ca -- what it carried with it when -- when 
it began en ma sse to -- to leave. Wh at is connected
 with it, of course, I mean I -- I™m drifting, but 
I™ll get back on the main track, is al so where we
re the fi  -- where were the -- the failings? The 

failings being did the organized Jewish worldafter 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third 

Reich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were l
eading?  After all, of
 the 600,000 German J e ws, 
300,000 remain in Germany. Now, again, I ma ke a statement like that and it sounds again like an 

exaggeration an-and unqualified.I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed ma y ha ve been 

tens of thousands who would have been -- who 
wanted to get out and the world wouldn™t take 
them in, including this country. 
But nonetheless, there were larg
e numbers of people, some  of 
whom I™ve known a mong -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on, 

who thought, you know, this is a passing busin
ess, and now we™re -- and now we™re -- good 
Germans wi ll -- will take care of this upstart over 
there because in othe r words, where th -- I f -- I 
forget about the world, but where 
-- where did the Jewish leadersh
ip?  And I am not trying to be 
ac-accusatory, I™m trying 
to -- to save what -- what did we f 
-- when I say we, I™m talking in the 
broad, historical [indecipherable
] sense, failed to see as to 
where it was going. Now you can 
make the argument I ca -- I talk to myself
, you know, I -- yo-you -- you can ma ke the argument 
on the other side to sa y there was no precedent for 
this type of -- of -- of organized ma ssacres, 
although there were ma ssacres in 
history. What follows from it
?  Had we -- had we really, 
collectively, deeply analyzed where this was going?  Maybe we could have done more than we -- 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
47 
 
 
than we did to get people out. To 
protect, to save, to -- to -- to 
d -- I don™t know to do what. So to 
-- to me , as I -- you know, being -- being imme rsed 
into this -- I don™t kno
w, up to the -- the tip 
of my head or whatever it is, or
 beyond it. I -- I say to myself, 
this --  this has to be more 
profoundly examined. I don™t know how else to [i
ndecipherable] some times I a m at a loss for 
words. But -- and -- and I think th
is is -- this is subjects for ph
ilosophers, this is subjects for 
ethicists, this is subjects for historians. The Je
ws -- the Jews would not be -- were not alone in 
this world. As a ma tter of fact the Jews were 
-- were more intert wined with the worl d than 
maybe any other people because they were -- becau
se they were scattered and because they had 
to survive always as mi norities. So -- so -- 

Q: Let me  a s k you some thing. Yo-You -- you were in Lasinar where -- where the -- 

A: Of course. 

Q: -- where the Luxemb ourg agreement was signed, yes? 

A: Of course. 
Q: You knew all these people at the be
ginning. You knew Nahum Goldma nn, you knew 
Blaustein, even Ben, in ger -- in Germany with the JRSO. 
A: Yeah. 

Q: What is it about these people?
 You were there, you™re one of those people. What is it that you 
think ma de them do this in a way that was so different? We re they different than people you had 

known?  Wa s there some thing special about these people? 

A: I don™t know I -- I wa nt to say special. I thinkwe knew that we couldn™t rema in either silent 

or passive. When I was approached in the mi ddl
e of the Berlin blockade in the summer of 1948 
by the general consul of the JDC, that I should 
take together the [indecipherable] and airlift 
myself out with -- with my pregnant wife out of
 -- out of Berlin [indecipherable] I think what 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
48 
 
 
people were telling me  at that tim
e, at beginning of a promising caree
r in -- in foreign service of 
the United St ates, which interested me imme nsel
y intellectually, I mean this is -- you know?  I 
can tell you to this day that -- that -- that my few 
months in the Berlin bloc
kade is -- is some thing 
that I have not yet in a similar way personally du
plicated in a sense. Because it was a -- such a 
confluence of -- of -- of incred
ible historic events in whic
h [indecipherable] found -- maybe I 
find myself as a -- as a small pawn, but a pawn in
 this -- in th-this particular mo me nt. And of 
course I s -- I saw enough of the DP™s and I 
saw enough of everything else. And -- and by that 
time I have seen enough also what has been done 
economically and so we  talked about in the -- 
in -- in -- in war crimes, etcete
ra. And -- and I said, I cannot sa
y no. Simpl e . Am I a great hero?  
Nothing, nonsense. I said one thing. I said the Berlin
 blockade was to me  like another act of war. 
And I said I was quite deeply invo
lved in -- in dealing with it in 
-- in one aspect of it. I said, I 
will request one year leave of absence fr om Gene
ral Clay, sayi ng very cl ear for what purpose, for 
the purpose of helping to establis
h or imple ment a program of which he was the [indecipherable] 
sponsor. It was part of that military governme nt 
law. But it meant, if you will, remo ving myself 
and my fa mi ly from the front line. The Berlin bl
ock -- they blockaded Berlin was the front line. 
Every night the lights were off like in -- like in
 the blitz Berlin -- the 
bl-blitz London, literally, 
okay?  And then I got permission. The [indecipherabl
e] leave of absence s
till continues, but -- 
Q: It still continues? 
A: I mean fi guratively speaking. 

Q: Right. 

A: But Benny -- for -- for Benny after -- after -- 
after the -- the -- the p 
-- prosecution of the 
Einsatzgruppen, to do some thing 
for the survivors, to -- to 
establish certain principles 
[i ndecipherable] the international law. He still --  he
 is still up to his eyeballs, he is older than I 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
49 
 
 
am. He is still up to hi s eyeballs in the -- in th
at  international criminal cour t and the acceptance 
of aggression as a war crime and up and up and up. 
Q: Right. You™re talkin
g about Ben Ferencz. 
A: Yeah, I™m talking about Ben. 

Q: Right. 

A: I -- we talk to each other every week, 10 da
ys, whatever it is. He says you -- you -- I know I 
have a few more years left, I got 
to -- I got to put aggression th
rough as a -- as a -- as a -- as a 
war crime and so on. Okay. And -- 

Q: So did you s -- you s -- did you stay in Berlin? 

A: No. 

Q: No, you left Berlin
 during the blockade? 
A: I left -- I had to 
leave Berlin because -- 

Q: Right. 
A: -- Benny was -- reme mber I told you who -- you 
couldn™t do in Germany anything unless you 
had -- under the umbrella. 

Q: Yeah, right.  

A: As the worker™s trials were comi ng to an end 
in Nurember g the -- the U.S. ar my could give us 
space, the U.S. army could give us housing because the Nuremberg trials were being 

[indecipherable] 

Q: Right. 

A: Okay?   

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
50 
 
 
A: So Benny grabbed this, he was right there as ex
ecutive council of the subs
equent trials, there -
- there was the first Nuremberg -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- killing trial and then there 
was the subsequent trials, led by 
General Taylor. The first trials 
were Justice Jackson, who -- who [indecipherable]
 if you followed it historically, you know what 
I™m talking about. So we ha
d to get out of Berlin. 

Q: And so you went to Nuremberg? 

A: So my pregnant wife and my 
dog and I went to Berlin -- went 
to Nuremberg, and that™s how it 
started. And -- and that™s how we -- we built an or
ganization overnight . We filed -- the law had --  

had, from our point of view, a terrible limitation. By the 31
st
 of Dece mber 1948, we had to file 
claims. Any claim that would not be dated by th-t
hat date is [indecipherable]. What did we do?  
We hired every retired clerk from a real estate 
registry, and s -- and reme
mber, it was right -- the 
deutsche ma rk was just comi ng i
n. We had deutsche ma rks, Benny was able to negotiate a loan 
from General Clay. Money -- we had no money to
 -- you know. And -- and we had these people. 
We told them, any change of -- 
of title, after ™33, if
 a name  sounds Jewish -- in Germany as you 
know, you can be Alfred Rosenberg [indecipherable] when you can be Robert Alfred Rosenberg, 

literally. And Schneider and I ha
ve to tell you and -- and [ind
ecipherable] and Ha mburger and 
whatever and whatever. I™ll tell 
you what -- one episode which is 
really very funny. And within 
five month we filed 163,000 pieces of paper becausewe knew that on the first of January we can 

tear up anything. But if it didn™t have a stamp 
of 31 Decembe r, 1948, finished. This is older -- 
old -- today too. All the propert
y restitution laws -- by the way, 
you should know that what we 
have today in East Germany, the former East 
Germany, whic h started in [i ndecipherable] is 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
51 
 
 
based practically word for word on everything 
we drew in -- negotiated out in ™47, and 
subsequently. And these are the foundations.  
Q: Right. 

A: That™s what people have to take a look a
nd see. It didn™t come , 
you know, like a -- as my 
Latin teacher used to sa y, like there was [indeciph
erable] from some where or
 -- or whatever. Or -
- or -- who jumped out of Zeus™ brow?  I forgot.  

Q: I forget, too. 

A: In Greek -- in Greek 
mythology. A fe ma le. Venus. 
Q: Oh, Ven us. 

A: I think Ve nus jumped out of Zeus™ brow. I 
be -- I better look it up when I go home. But -- a-
and so it -- it comes from some
thing. And -- and that™s what we  did. And you know, f-for us, for 

Benny, for me , with the first money that we were ab
le to realize from the recovery process, we 
helped the Jewish agency to buy prefabs and [indeci
pherable] so the DP™s who were sitting in old 
British army barracks in 1949 and in 1950 in [indeci
pherable] in the -- in 
the transit camps and 
so on, could be taken out and put into decent housi
ng. That, to him, to me, to us, I mean it -- by 

that time -- by that time we had the whole army. We 
had an office in Frankfurt and an office in 
Stuttgart and an office in Kassel, and an office in Munich and up and down, we -- because how 

else -- 

Q: This is the JRSO 
had all those offices? 
A: Yeah, sure. American zone of Germany. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: It was only in 1949 when the British and th
e Fr ench, but pri-primarily the British because 
we™re put on in a enormous pressure in the Britis
h parliame nt. When -- when the -- when th-the -

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
52 
 
 
- the foreign office refused in 1947 to elect a pa
rallel law to the American military government 
restitution law, we cranked up pre
ssure in Britain. And the British Jewish organiza tions started 
stormi ng the -- the British parliame nt. And the 
British came around two years 
later, okay?  As the 
Germans sa y [indecipherable] wasn™t so simple. You know, these -- we had to -- we had to blast 
out. But, I wouldn™t even say it was the hosti
le, it was just -- it™s not done. You know, 
[indecipherable] you c -- you -- you -- you cut out a 
-- the holy -- a holy principle of -- of -- of 
law and succession and whatever and whatev
er. So --so -- oh, we have to stop? 

Q: We  have to stop the tape, yes, I™m sorry. 
End of Tape Four 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
53 
 
 
Beginning Ta pe Five 
Q: So are you going to tell 
us a funny story about -- 
A: Out of -- 
Q: JR -- JRSO? 

A: I™ll tell you what 
the funny story was -- 
Q: Yeah. 

A: -- we told all these clerks from the real estate
 registers to register a
ny transfer of title which 
occurred after 1933, involving some one with a Je
wish sounding name . So we get a claim by a 
ma n called Alfr ed Rosenberg, who has sold a villa in Berlin. Until we -- and so it was a proper 

claim filed, you know, with a rest
itution agency. When we finally
 came around to investigate it, 
because each claim had to be substantiated even
tually. You had to establish that there was a 
forced sale, you had to establish 
that these people were
 Jewish. You have to establish that the 
proper consideration was paid, etcetera, etcetera.
 We started digging into the antecedents of 
Alfred Rosenberg, it was the ideologue of 
the Nazi party, whose villa in 1937 was not good 
enough for him. He sold the old villa and then pro
ceeded to buy a new villa. So -- so we  filed a 
claim for the -- for the restitution of --  of the villa of -- of Alfr ed Rosenberg and the --  and it was 

under -- for years it was pending because, 
you know, with 163,000 pieces of paper, it took 
awhile until -- until it all got
 processed. And this -- this -- this
 is not a ma de up story, this is a 
true thing. 

Q: But it got processed? 

A: It got processed, we had to withdraw it, we ha
d to tear it up. He was -- he was not a Jew, 
nobody persecuted him. And he, by the way, we talked
 in the car about loot
ed art. He was the 
ma ster mi nd of the ma ssive campaign of -- of looti
ng art, and building the museum to the extinct 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
54 
 
 
race. That was Alfred, these are documents, me mo
s that Alfred Rosenberg was going to build it. 
And he needed all -- he needed -- he was going 
to do it the way he would have built the museum 
of Gr-Greek antiquities. 
Everything fr om Torah s c rolls, to 
ceremonial objects, to -- to -- to 
rabbinical [indecipherable] to whatever would esta
blish the -- the artifacts and the --  or  the 
evidence of this --  of this strange, evil tribe th
at --  that  polluted the -- 
the wor -- the -- the human 
race.  
Q: But when you and Ben were doing this work together, you were in a sense ma king up things, 

because there was no precedent fo
r any of this, am I correct? There was a law, but there was no 
precedent. 

A: As far as we knew we  had to improvise, or -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- or -- or develop simply the -- the -- th
e system, the me thodology, the -- for instance, I™ll 
give you an example. These funds had to be -- we
 -- we -- we -- we -- we wanted to raise money 
as quickly as possible, to help th
e resettleme nt process. At that poi
nt  there were still survivors in 
DP ca mps in Germany, particularly camps like 
Fernwald or so on, where the -- were the DP 
camps wh-whom other countries, except Israel
 were not willing to take. People with tu-

tuberculosis, people with m- me ntal
 problems and so on. So, pra -- to
 -- to generate funds claim 
by claim, claim by claim, claim by -- to develop th
e technique of bulk settleme nts, we turned to 
the state governments and we said, look, we got 10,000 
claims in -- in -- in Ba
varia. At this point 
the -- the German owner s of thes
e properties are not very happy to see us. Nevermind how they 
acquired it, but they -- they -- th
ey been sitting on it, in some  cases for -- for 15 years or 

whatever. They got used to that. And you buy 
up our claims  and you settle it with your own 
citizens at your own time in [indecipherable] a
nd so on. There™s no precedent. We  de veloped a 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
55 
 
 
technique to generate funds quicker
 and -- and -- and to -- to -- to 
ma ke it -- th-the funds were -- 
went primarily to the Joint Distri bution Committ
ee, and to the Jewish agency, which were the 
two major or ganizations resettling the Holocaust surv
ivors, the Jewish agency in Israel and the -- 
the JDC with HIAS and so on throughout th
e world, and then rebuilding the Jewish 
communities.  

Q: So you did not give out the money directly. You funneled it through these two primary 

agencies, is that correct? 

A: Plus -- corre -- 85 percent of our 
-- of the -- we™re 
talking now JRSO?  
Q: Yeah. 

A: Not Claims Conference? 

Q: Right. 

A: JRSO™s formula was 85 percent to the two bi
g agencies of which the JDC -- of which the 
Jewish agency got the larger pa
rt of the 85 percent, and the other 15 percent was smaller grants 
or projects sponsored by the Council of Jews in 
Germany, after all these were
 assets of -- of Jews 
-- of Germa n Jews who didn™t survive. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so on, and they have special projects. 
And the Leo Baeck Instit
ute received -- was born 
in 1955 with money which we helped -- which ca
me  out from the JRSO. I can take you to 
Queens, and you will find one housing project af
ter the ot her, for elderly [indecipherabl e] 
victims run by [indecipherable], which came out of 
this mone y and so on, and in -- and in Israel, 
and so -- so we had to -- obviously we  had to, as 
I said to you earlier, repa
rations as such were 
always done state to state, even today. If tomo
rr ow Cuba -- Castro disappears and Cuba and so 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
56 
 
 
on, there would be a Cuban government which is 
likely to negotiate with the United States 
governme nt on behalf to th -- of the Amer
ican citizens who have Cuban descent. 
Q: And that -- but 
that™s typical. 
A: That -- that was -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- that is pre-history. 

Q: Right. 

A: I think, by the way, in part, our experien
ce by now, which governme nt™s a hundred percent -- 
reme mber, we always represented tens of thousa
nds of people of different nationalities. When 
we have now ma de payments to Jewish slave laborers who ma de it to fr e -- in 44 countries today, 

okay? 

Q: Did -- did the experience in the JRSO that
 you brought with you when you came to the United 
States and joined the claims conference, yes? 
A: I was asked -- 
Q: To come .  

A: I was asked to come  to -- to -- and I continued, you know -- 

Q: With the JRSO -- 

A: I -- oh sure. 

Q: -- yes. 

A: I -- I™m -- I™m -- I™m s till th
e -- the -- I -- I s -- I still am 
-- although the JRSO is now th -- 
dorma nt and been dorma nt for years, but to 
go back, the j -- the expe
rience of the JRSO 
obviously wa s the forerunner of -- of what
 the Claims  Conference had to build. 
Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
57 
 
 
A: That was absolutely -- 
Q: That™s what I was gonna ask. 

A: -- clear. 

Q: Yes. 

A: It was, however, the component elements, the 
-- the principles were th
ere. Structurally it had 
to become  much larger. If you will look at the in
corporators of the -- of the JRSO, it is ma ybe 10 
organizations . And you will find it ba sically, with th -- with the exception of the Jewish agency, 

these organizations based in the three wester
n countries, which were 
the occupying countries, 
U.S., Britain, France, and of course, the cons --
 the -- the German Jews, i n Germany, outside of 
Germany, because of the origin of this and 
because we had to deal with Germany. When 
Germany, in 1949, when the first central governme
nt was es tablished in West Germa ny and 
Konrad Adenauer became its chancellor, and the 
fi r --  and the fi rst attempts were -- begin to 
ma ke the first attempts, believe it or not, were 
addressed to the four pow
ers. The governme nt of 
Israel, in the winter of 1951 addresse
d a note to the four occupying powers 
Q: Is this pi --  

A: -- the Soviets [indecipherable] 

Q: -- this is --  this is Weitzman™s letter, or me mo ? Oh, ri ght --  

A: No, We itzma n ca me  earlier, no -- 

Q: -- uh-huh, okay. 

A: -- W- Wei t zman came earlier. 

Q: Okay. 

A: You™re quite right, We itzma n came earlier. But th
en subsequently the gove
rnme nt of Israel -- 
Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
58 
 
 
A: By the way, if you want to check that to be 
precise, is if you™ll find, 
probably in the library, 
the book by Nana Sagi -- 
Q: Yes. 

A: -- on the negotiations. 

Q: Right. 

A: Because that book is exclusively de voted to 
the negotiations. And so the -- the first formal 
approach by the state of Israel
 was to the four occupying go -- 
powers. The Soviets ignored it. 
For the British and the Fr ench it was -- but the 
Americans by that time said, you got to talk to 
Konrad Adenauer, you got to talk to the government. 

Q: Right. 

A: And again to the credit of the U.S. -- at that
 time  Clay was already 
gone, it was no longer a 
military governor, it was a United States hi gh co
mmissioner. And then -- and this terminology is 
-- has real significance, because it was past th
e stage of a military government occupying, it was 
the follow-up of a military occupation to the -- 
to a representative of the United States and 
Britain and France respectively negotiating with 
the first central West German government for 
the removal of all -- of all elements of occ
upation from the new Ger many. It was a gradual 
process and it found its full expression in some
thing that was called contractual agreements. 
Periodically, step by step, the western powers w
ould negotiate with the Adenauer governme nt. 
These prerogatives of the allies are gone, thes
e prerogatives are gone, and we were in the mi ddle 
of it, insisting and the -- and 
the federal government -- Germa n 
federal governme nt took it over -
- had to take it over, by they wa
y I -- in all fairness to them, I don™t think they necessarily 
resist ed it, or  it has to be checked because I™m quite su
re it -- that the principl
es of the allied -- of 
the American military government restitution law became German federal law. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
59 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: In other words, they had to -- 

Q: Take it on. 

A: -- to take it in and over. 

Q: Right. 

A: Th -- we -- we could -- we negotiated and we 
could not allow a situatio
n that the removal of 
powers which the occupying governme
nt™s had, that the rule of th
at would mean the elimination 
of this type of legisla
tion. And that has been preserved, includ
ing the principles of the successor 
organization, so that when in 1990 -- now you go b
ack, and you go back to 
-- to -- to -- nearly 50 
years or so, when the 1990 unifi
cation took place, the unification a-agreement and the unified 
Germany said this lil -- this property restitution le
gislation or  the princi ples will be incorporated 
in the so-called re-privatization 
law, but the succe -- the original
 successor organizations were 
still listed as -- as potential su
ccessor organizations. And if they would not come  so that they 
present themselves, then the Claims Conferen
ce became their successor organizations. By that 

time they™re all [indecipherable] successor orga niza
tions were dorma nt and -- and so on. But th -- 
what I™m trying to tell you is -- is
 that these principles and concep
ts were -- were integrated -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- into the We st German, and subse
quently, I would say 
after 1919 to the -- 
Q: East [indecipherable] 

A: -- unified Germany. 

Q: Right, right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514

A: And that was one of the things that we were
 deeply involved because we  had to ma ke sure 
that all this does not get tossed out
 by virtue of the fact that th
e allied powers have relinquished 
their -- their rights and pr
erogatives in Germany. 
Q: Did Britain and France finally agree 
to that, or it didn™t ma tter any more? 
A: No, they agreed, I me an -- 
Q: They did. 

A: -- I™ll tell you, in all fairness, once the Br
itish and the French, in 1949 enacted parallel 
legislation -- 

Q: Oh they did, okay -- 

A: Oh yes, in their zones -- 

Q: Oh, yes. 

A: -- and subsequently in the z -- respective sect
ors of Berlin -- reme mbe r  Berlin was cut up in 
four sectors, like four zones, Am
erican, British, French and -- and 
Soviet , so that the same laws 
and so on applied in -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- in the western sectors and 
the western zone s. From that poi
nt on, the allies, the British and 
the French were going along with the Americans,
 and -- and from that point on it was a -- a 
tripartite pr ocess. And -- 

Q: So there is a -- a hi stor y to wh
ich the Claims Conference, right -- 

A: Now y -- if you want to go now to the birth of the Claims  Conference -- 

Q: Yes, but what I -- I guess what I™m asking is is 
that there --  that  ther e is a histor y on which the 
Claims Conference ba ses the possibi lity of what they™re going to do, because the JR -- 

A: That -- that is -- that wa
s -- that ™s absolutely correct . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
61 
 
 
Q: Because it doesn™t come  out from nowhere either. 
A: No. One -- once it became clear th
at the answer lies in a negotiation with the new fi rst post-
war German government for West Germany, of who 
-- from here on if I ta
lk until unification -- 
Q: It™s West Germany, right. 

A: It is the [indecipherable] 
Republic, it™s the Federal Republi
c of Ger many, but it was We st 
Germany, obviously. From that point on, there -- the 
whole effort to -- to 
be -- to -- to ca -- to 
reach s-s-some  kind of a n understanding with this
 governme nt, and the United States helped us a 

great deal. John McCloy as the high commission
er was on good terms with Konrad Adenauer, 
and -- and McCloy encouraged Adenauer, but it wa
sn™t only -- Adenauer was not a -- a passive 
little nobody whom some body could push around. Ad
enauer and -- and part of the post-war 
German political establishment saw two things. One,
 cold, if you will, cold -- cold calculation, if 
-- that  if Germany is to enter into the fa mily 
of western nations, it cannot ignore this chapter, it 
has to do -- do some thing with this -- with 
this problem. And I would say for both Adenauer 
himself, and people like Kurt Schumacher, who 
-- who -- who is the head of the Social 
De mocratic party and -- and hims
elf a concentration camp inmate -- reme mber from ™33 to ™38 
the German concentration camps wer e  populated
 by non-Jews, by German 
political opponents of 
-- of -- of the Nazis. There ma y have been so
me  [indecipherable] Jews among them, there ma y 
have been Jewish Communists, Je
wish Social Democrat, Jewish 
Trade Unionists, whatever, but 
they weren™t -- not until -- not
 until the burning of th
e synagogues in November of 1938 were 
there rarge -- large round-ups of Jews who were
 placed in concentration camps. People forget 

about it. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
62 
 
 
A: I used to remi nd my c olleagues and some  of
 my Jewish friends, you know, who used to say 
every -- every good German is every dead Germa n, you know, that type of thing. And I used to 
say, don™t forget -- don™t forget there was Oran
ienburg and Sachsenhausen and so on, between 
™33, and November of 1938, and they were popul
ated, and they were populated by non-Jews. 
Okay, that™s a different subject
 that some body should al
so look at, the whol
e attitude of -- it 
wasn™t easy.  

Q: When you heard Adenauer spea
k about this, or when you read 
what he said, did you believe 
him?  

A: Yes. 

Q: You did? 

A: Adenauer was the ma yor of Cologne when Hitler came  to power. 

Q: Right. 

A: He was thrown out by the Nazis. I mean, they
 didn™t lock him up or a
nything else, but he was 
thrown out, closed the offices, and so on. So he 
had no particular love, although he was a -- what 
the Germans still liked to call a [indecipherable]
 you know, a -- more than a pragma tist, I would 
say. In -- in ma ny ways he could 
be a -- a cold calculator. One of 
his chiefs of staff, a ma n called 
Gropke was as a lawyer the one who -- who drafted 
some  of the Nurembe r g laws in the Ministry 
of Justice of the Third Re ich, but by the way was very
 helpful to us later on in the course of the 
negotiation. You know, you can -- you -- you can -- 

Q: Who knows? 

A: -- you can write plays about it -- 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
63 
 
 
A: -- or -- or -- or psychologica
l essays. And -- but th-there wa
s no doubt about it that Konrad 
Adenauer was also a de vout Cat
holic. I can tell y
ou that on the 10
th
 of September 1952, when the 
agreements were signed in the old rathouse of Luxembourg, a nd all the signing was over, and it 
was very solemn and very tense, I would say, a
nd there were three documents that were signed, 

Adenauer with Moshe Sharett, the first one is
 so Israel and the so
-called [i ndecipherable] 
agreement of the -- the German -- the German Israeli reparations agreement -- the word 

reparations was not used. Some bod
y invented a very nice word
 called collective reco mpense. 
You can write it down, it™s a -- a term attributed
 to that particular thing, because there wa s no 
state of Israel  during the Hitler peri od, etcetera
, okay. And then the two docume nts that were 
signed by Nahum Goldma nn as the founding presiden
t of the Claims  Conference, and Adenauer, 
after all this was fi nished, Mr
. Adenauer got up and went into the chapel, which was in the 
rathouse of -- old rathouse of Luxe mb ourg and cl
osed the door, and was there for quite awhile. 
And I always thought that that 
was genuine. That that was now -- there was no question in my 
mi nd about the c -- [indecipherable] was subsequen
tly very critical of Adenauer and Adenauer™s 
party because Adenauer could not deliver 100 percen
t of his -- me mbers of his party to ratify the 
-- the Luxembourg agreements. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Schumacher delivered all the 
social democrats, every one of 
them. Adenauer si  -- delivered 
the majority but not --  but not all of them. Anywa
y, that™s part of politics, but it is the --  but --  
but what became  clear is that when finally Adenau
er appeared in September of ™51 in the Bundist 
[indecipherable] Rosh Hashanah and delivered th
at famous statement about unspeakable crimes 
were committed in the name of the German peop
le, etcetera, and extended an invitation to the 
state of Israel and to repres
entative the world [indecipherable]
, and wanted to create an 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
64 
 
 
instrume nt of voluntary agencies, which would be 
as broad and as representative to be a proper 
negotiating party to a government. All this
 was unprecedented. And Nahum Goldma nn then 
convened the 23 me mber organizations in the Wa
ldorf Astoria in October of ™51, and that™s 
where the Claims Conference was born, first of al
l i-in --  initially, A, to provide worldwide 
backing to the state of Israel 
is --  in its ne-negot iations with --  with the German Federal 
Republic, and then to develop the programs of 
cl aims and dema nds on be half the Holocaust 
survivors wherever they were. And -- and if you™ll 
take so that the -- the JRSO as such had too 
narrow an institutional base at that time. [i nd
ecipherable] these 10 -- 10 or ganizations. And it had 
to be as broad geographically, 
ideologically and philo
sophically. And if you 
take a look at the 
me mbership from -- from ™51 to this day, you will find geographically the Canadian Je wish 
Congress, the ma jor American or
ganizations, the leading Argentin
ean organizations, the leading 
Australian organization, the leadi
ng South African organization, the 
Jewish agency for Israel, the 
-- the leading French, British, the German, the worl
d organi za tions. [i ndeciphera ble] Israel worl d 
organization on one hand, and the World Union of 
Progressive Judaism, who were fighting tooth 
and nail each other philosophica
lly, clear. This is fire 
and water, theologically. 
Q: Right. 
A: And it was -- it was, I think Nahum Gold ma n n™s genius ability, but also the -- the -- the 

ma turity and the responsiveness of all the organi
zations who recognize this, on this issue, we all 
have to come  together. Li ke in the old days 
of -- I don™t know, of the 
-- of the court of King 
Arthur, all the swords ha d to -- ha d to be left 
in the -- in the anteroom, because we, within the 
parame ters, we were established. We had to 
be united and representatives and we were. 
Organizations that continued to fight each ot
her philosophically and publicly, I mean the 
American Jewish Committee and 
the World Jewish Congress were
 -- were philosophically at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
65 
 
 
loggerheads much less su-su-subsequently. This 
whole Claims Confere nce 
experiment turned out 
from the -- this is another aspect, turned out 
to be from -- from the Jewish communal -- the 
development of Jewish communal structures. A tremendous e xperime nt with -- consequently 
would have never had a presid
ent™s conference in the United 
States today if the Claims 
Conference would not have been there before. 
Because these -- these dive rgent or gani zations 
discovered that they could sit 
around one table, had a clearl
y defined agenda and clearly 
designated parame ters. In the Claims Conferen
ce, neither  Nahu m Goldma nn as the president,

August of ™82, [indecipherable] as the top 
professional whatever [indecipherable] the board
 of the Claims  Confer
e nce on any issue which 
was other than within the clear parameters a
nd confines of the Claims Conference ma ndate. 
Otherwise it couldn™t --

A: -- it couldn™t function. 
Q: Mm. We have --

Q: I understand that at the beginning of the Cl

you pronounce the name  of that town, Visenar? 

A: Well, Wa ssenaar. 

Q: Wassenaar.

Q: There was -- there were people who were 
against getting any money fr om Ger many -- 
A: Oh, that, yeah. 

Q: -- isn™ t that corr ec
t?  Wasn™ t  t h ere a - - 
A: There were more than that, the -- the -- that -- 

Q: [indecipherable] 
A: -- [indecipherable] people, there was a m -- in Is
rael itself, this became  a -- the most explosive 
issue that if -- that the Ben Gu
rion governme nt, which was the first governme nt of Is rael faced. 
Menachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben 
Gurion governme nt on all kinds of issues, and 
this became one of the major issues in his bat
tle with Ben Gurion. The argume nt was when we 
should take th -- we should not take any blood 
mo ney, and -- and the -- it 
-- it took the form of 
demonstrations, it took the for m of - -  of such se
ri ous demonstrations that I think for the fi rst time 
in the history of the state of Israel, the Kenesit had to be surrounded by police, ma ybe by army 

too, but when Ben Gurion went in January of 1952 to
 the Kenesit to rec -- to receive a majority 
vote for Israel entering into negotiations with
 Germany. So t hat controversy was partially 
philosophical, or partially moral if you will. I m
ean, there were people who -- who really, out of 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
67 
 
 
genuine inne r convictions, and there were people who -- who mi xed the opposition with -- with 
direct political -- this was a -- a -- a very strong 
issue, you have to think 
about it. Th -- by that 
time there were several hundred thousand survivors 
already in -- in Israel, 
and it was a -- a v -- a 
very controversial issue, and it 
-- it took the form of -- as I 
say of -- of -- of very ma jor 
demonstrations in Israel. In the United States, 
in New York, we had one really serious episode. 
And that is, we had one day a meeting, after the or
iginal meeting in the Wa
ldorf, in another hotel 
in New York, and a group of a young -- there wa
s a youth o-organization of the -- of Begin™s 
party, and -- and they -- that organization was ca
lled Betar. This is -- today it would be the youth 
move me nt of the Likud in Israel
, the -- the -- the -- the logica
l political extension of that 
move me nt. And they came  into the hotel where 
we had the meeting, and they had a -- a sit down 
strike. They sat down in the ha
llway blocking the access -- exit and 
the entrance to my  meetings, 
and we had to get -- after, when the meetings 
were over, we wanted to get Nahum Goldma nn and 
other of the people out because you never know if you 
get, particularly that this was -- Betar is a 
-- was a pretty militant gr oup anyway, but in Ne
w York -- in New York they were -- I mean, 
outside of Israel there were f 
-- people ideologicall
y, philosophically, thereare people today who 
say they™re not going to go to Germa ny to visit, 
or I will not buy a Germa n product and so on. I 
mean, even today, to this day, but certainly in -- 
in -- in those days. And it 
was -- it went so far, 
for instance, that there wa s one group of -- of
 Holocaust survivors who organized themselves 

generally, and those were the people who ca me
 out of Bergen-Belsen, of the Bergen-Belsen 
camp. And although the -- the ch
airman of their group, a ma n called Joseph Rosensaft was 
actually helpful in connection with the negotiati
ons, his organization and these people would -- 
would -- they would not want -- they did not want
 to become  me mbers of the Claims Conference 
because they couldn™t br ing themselves to negoti
ate with the Germans, 
regardless of who the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
68 
 
 
Germans we re who were negotiating partners. 
Anyway, by January of ™52, Ben Gurion got his 
approval of the ma jority of the Kenesit, the 
Claims Conference was ready to go, and we had 
internal discussions between the Claims  Conf
erence and Mr. Sharett in pr eparation for the 
negotiations. But that -- we were -- one thing at 
that time  was  clear, none of us would go to 
Germany for negotiations. So this -- the -- the gov
ernment of Israel had to find a neutral country 
that was willing to host us. And that was not so
 si mple because it required security. We never 
knew whether neo-Nazi elements or
 any other elements were going 
to -- to cause problems . The 
Dutch governme nt agreed and ma de available to 
us, a chateau. A me dieval castle with a moat 
and a drawbridge, literally. You 
can still see it, it™s now a co
nference center. And the German 
delegation, headed by 20 Nazis and the Claims 
Conference delegation andthe Israel delegation 
were all housed in the same  chateau, in differe
nt wings and so on, in the same  place. And the 
negotiations were, as a rule, in the morning be
tween the Germans and the Israelis, and in the 
afternoon between the Ge rmans and the Claims Conf
erence, and in the evenings and in between, 
of course, the Claims Conferen
ce, and the Israeli de
legates we re together, obviously together 
[indecipherable]. And there were, 
of course, crises, and periods 
when we had to interrupt the 
negotiations and go over there to f -- had to fly 
from Paris to -- to Bonn to negotiate with 
Adenauer on the contentious issues and to find 
some  kind of compromi se . This happened several 
times. I personally had to shuttle mo re frequently, because as the executive director of the 
Claims Conference, our negotiati
ons policy committee was sitting in New York, of t he top lay 
leadership of the Claims  Conference, and I would 
-- and first of all the Claims Conference as an 
organization had to function. So I would sh -- spe
nd a couple of weeks in 
-- in negotiations and 
fly back to New York and -- and we -- the or
ganization go back and forth. But we also had 
periods when the negotiations were suspended because there were serious differences of opinion. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
69 
 
 
The negotiations lasted fr om the 22
nd
 of March -- as a matter of fact, a day after tomorrow will 
be -- 207 -- 52 -- 55 years. 
Q: Really. 

A: Exactly. I ca -- didn™t think about it. 55 years since we landed in
 a separate runway in -- in -- 
in Amsterdam. We  were flown in because Dutch secu
rity didn™t want us to c -- to come  in with 
the regular business. So -- so they landed us on 
a -- on a secluded -- and packed us into cars, and 
brought us to the Kasteel oud Wa sse naar, the castle 
of old Wassenaar. Had one
 great vir -- virtue 
as far as I wa s concerned. Wa s w
ithi -- within the walking distance of a beautiful museum which 
has a fantastic Rembrandt, and that is called the 
Mauritshuis House, the 
house of a ma n called 
Mauritshuis. And there is ﬁThe Anatomy Lessonﬂ
 by Rembra ndt which is as big as this wall. 
And after 12 - 14 hours, I would r
un a -- run away from the chateau
 with a Dutch security guard 
who hated museums passionately. Pr obably as a kid 
he must have been dragged by his hair to a 
museum and I would say to him, you can sit out
side and smoke your lousy cigarettes, and I™ll 
give you a pi ece of paper if anything happens to 
me inside of the museum, it™s my responsibility. 
And that -- that then, after awhi
le I thought that these characters from the -- from the painting 

will start talking to me. I mean it --  this is a fa
nt astic pa inting, it™s still ther e. Anyway, and we 
were there with intervals for -- until the 
third week of Augus t, more or less. 
Q: Really?  So long?   

A: I mean, but ther e were intervals. 

Q: Right. 

A: Sub [indecipherable] delegati
on had to go back and we™d come  back and -- and they were 
very complicated issues, they were issues 
of -- that overlapped, because we negotiated 
compensation agreements which affected all vi
ctims of Nazi persecuti
on, whether they were 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
70 
 
 
Israeli citizens, or American citizens, or Aust
ralian ci -- or [indecipherable]. And -- and there 
were overlaps. The German delegation, by the way, 
was headed initially by 
two anti-Nazis, one a 
Professor Burn, a professor of civil law from 
Fra nkfurt University, who I believe was -- was 
towards the end of the war in a Gestapo jail
. And a ma n called Dr. Otto Kirsten, who was a 
leading Pr otestant  pol-politician o-opposing the H
itler regi me. He was a lawyer in Stuttgart, and 
-- and there was a t -- an issue a-and they were 
our negotiating partners. Of course, they would 
receive instructions from the Adenauer governme
nt, and at time s there were issues where -- 
where we knew that --  that they were communica
ting to us positions that  they personally were 
not necessa rily in favor of. And this was the time
 that we instinctually would call time  out and 
get ahold of -- of Nahum Goldma nn 
in Paris and tell him to -- and ask him to fly to -- to Bonn to 
negotiate with Adenauer. And -- and Goldma nn was 
fantastic in that respect, I mean. This i -- 
this was a ma n with a broad in
tellectual horizon, a broa
d western intellect. Although he was born 
in -- in -- in a small town in -- 
in what would be Lithuania, Ithink, today, but his parents early 
went to Germany, and he was a product of Heidel
berg and I don™t know wh
at other universities. 
And during World Wa r I, believe it or not, as a 
very young academic, I think he worked for the -- 
for the Kaiser™s foreign mi nistry on some  -- you 
know, routine job over ther
e, it is -- was -- the 
reason I me ntion all this is -- is because his -- 
his cultural root s -- I™m talking -- I™m not talking 
about the Jewish cultural roots, 
I™m talking hi s general roots. Hi
s academic roots were, to a very 
great extent , similar to the -- to the people -- the 
policy ma kers of the new -- of the new Ger man -
- of the new post-war Germany. I me an, he a
nd Adenauer would -- would -- he would go to 
Switzerland to -- to -- to spend 
hours and hours with Adenauer on issues that had nothing to do 
with us. Va-Vacation issues, the -- whatever. A
nd -- but this was a ma n with a -- with a very 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
71 
 
 
broad political, international, dipl omatic talent s,
 and a ma n from whom I 
learned a great deal. He 
was old enough to be my father. He 
was born in ™95, and I wa s born in ™22. 
Q: Right. It™s a big difference. 
A: And I™m right, he was -- correct. And -- 

Q: Did -- did -- did you have sympathy with thos
e -- with people like Begin and those people 
who were against getting mone
y?  Did you -- did you underst -- 
A: [indecipherable] put it this way first. I™ll be 
very precise on this point
, because I wrestled with 
it. There were indi viduals who had an inner mora
l, ethi cal, personal inabil
ity to face anything or 
anybody which remi nded them of Germany. The n th
ere were politicians, 
who -- about whom I 
was not alwa ys sure where the pol
itical consideration, that this 
is a hot issue under which I can -- 
I can undercut my opponent, or whether there was -- th
is was a pure moral issue. So I -- I -- I di -
- I do -- I don™t tend to pass judgment on it,
 but my view is completely different. 
Q: And wha t  was your view? 
A: My view was and is and always will be , we were ther e dema nding what is rightfully ours, and 
we were demanding it from those who were -- who 
had responsibility. In ma ny cases who even 
controlled the assets and -- and ove
rall who had the moral, legal, 
historic responsibility to ma ke 
amends for what their pred
ecessor governme nt had done. The f-first post-war Germa n 
governme nt said very clearly and un
equivocally, it is the succe -- fo
r better or for wo
rse, it is the 
successor state of the Third Re
ich. He  didn™t play game s lik
e cur -- like [indecipherabl e] 
Q: Right. 

A: So to me , we -- we were not there seeking char
ity, or pleading for -- t-to be nice to us, or to 
have me rcy on us. We  were there dema nding our rights. 

Q: Right. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
72 
 
 
A: And in the indivi dual basis, what will I say 
if -- if -- if somebody inju
red me bodily and -- and 
-- and the person will be -- we will go to court, I w
ill refuse to confront him?  I mean, to me that -
- to me this was -- w-was -- was a clear cut issue. I always felt --  well, now we™re not talking 
about I -- I would say we collectively felt -- 
after all, this was 
not an individual -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- exercise. We  collectively felt that A, ther
e had to be an acknowledgeme nt of responsibility, 
whether it was Konrad Adenauer™s statement, or 
whether it was at the time when -- when it -- the 

year 2000 we signed the agreement on the slave la
bor business, the president of the Federal 
Republic of Germany in the year 2000, on the da
y when we signed the agreement establishing 
the slave labor fund, delivered a clear, unequivoc
al statement acknowledging responsibility, even 
-- he went even emotionally asking for forgiveness,
 etcetera, and he certainly was an anti-Nazi or 
whatever it is, but he was the head of the succ
essor state of the Third Reich, and they were 
dealing with the consequences of it. Don™t get 
me  wrong, I don™t say that 
everything that -- that 
was already accomplished is all that should have
 been accomplished, and so on. There will never 
be what the Germans call [speaks German here]. The term [speaks German] means to make 

whole. 

Q: Right. 

A: What has been done can never be made w
hole. I™m not talking, obviously about si x million 
dead human beings that can™t -- even the ma teri
al losses cannot be ma de 
whole. The -- the full 
amends cannot be ma de to anybody who survived a 
concentration camp or a ghetto, or -- or -- or 
who lost some body who was -- who was near and 
dear. But -- but it -- it -- we a -- we -- we 
approached and [indecipherable
] properly, as a matter of right
, seeking the acknowledgement 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
73 
 
 
and then negotiating some  for ms of -- of -- what
™s -- wh-what I would sa
y simply, a measure of 
justice. That™s the best I can say. 
Q: Right. Well, let me  ask you about
 the Israeli governme nt at th
at time. As -- and I don™t know 
whether you see it differently than the Claims 
Conference as a group of 
people, but the Israeli 
economy was in horrible shape at that time, and 
they had already accepted -- what were there, 
300,000 or 500,000 survivors. So they were in 
a very difficult pos
ition financially. 
A: [indecipherable] know that the whole basis of th
e negotiations were -- they had -- there was a 
clear distinction of th
e foundation of the negotiations betw
een the governme nt of Israel and 
Germany, a nd the Claims Confere nce. The governme
nt of Israel requested or sought 1.5 billion 
dollars on the basis of the cost 
of absorption of 500,000 Jewish victims of Nazi persecution, first 
in the [i ndeci pherabl e], fi rst in the Palestine and s
ubsequently in the -- in 
Israel itself. And it was 
this one bi llion 500 million dollars which was th
e basis of the negotiation. The settlement was 
then -- a portion of it was 
roughly half of it. But -- but that wa
s the basis. The Claims Conference 
basis was compensation for depravat
ion of liberty, for loss of provide
r, for dama ge to health, for 
interrupted -- 

Q: Education? 

A: -- occupation. For assets that were confiscat
ed, lost or destroyed. For communal institutions 
that were obliterated, and on and on and on. If 
you will take a look at our documents, they had 

two protocols. The -- the 
-- the legislative protocol is pages 
and pages and pages not of laws, of 
commitments to enact laws. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

A: The German finance mi nistry published at 
its own expense, seven thick volumes on the 
specific implementation of these agreements. They
™re innumerable -- they are basic laws, they 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
74 
 
 
are regulations, they are court ru
lings. I mean, this is a ma ssive legislative, admi nistrative body 
of work that has -- that has evolved out of this. 
Q: Right. Now why -- 

A: Now, for Israel -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- their -- the repar -- the -- the [indeci
pherable] agreement was vital for its economi c  
development. You also have to bear in mi
nd something which you -- which sounds incredible 
today. The German government at th
at point was not in a position to
 settle this claim for money, 
so it ended up working out an agreement with th
e provision of goods and services to Israel, with 
a limited mo netary comp onent for the purchase of
 petrol eum from Great Britain. It was a time 
when the state of Israel -- when the agreement wa
s signed, the state of Isr
ael was four years and -
- and four month old, and in those days it couldn™t 
get a letter  of credit in
 a Swiss bank for love 
or money. The first bank that really opened up to
 the state of Israel, believe it or  not, was the 
Bank of America, which was created and establis
hed by -- by an Italian im
mi grant in California. 
If you look into the hi stor y of the Bank of Ameri
ca, it was established -- the name will come to 
me in a mi nute -- and the American banking syst
em in those days was -- was run by WASPs, by 

good -- by good -- you know -- but Bank of Amer ica 
was created by [indecipherable] like -- I 
mean it -- it-it™ll co -- anyway, the fi rst real  st
rong foreign bank that was ready to do business 
with Israel was the Bank of America. Now I -- 
I say all this to you because the -- the -- a good 
part of the infrastructure of Isr
ael was -- was established as a resu
lt of this agreement. The fi rst 
merchant marine, the Zimlines as they were call
ed, were -- were ships built in --  in Hamburg and 
in other -- and in other port c
ities of Germany. The port of As
hdod, which is the second port after 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
75 
 
 
Haifa was built out of German reparations money. The 
-- a good part of the electric gr id of Israel. 
So -- so for Israel, this was a -- a very 
important agreement in its practical -- 
Q: Now, the arrangement also was that the good
s and services would go to Israel and then 20 
percent would come  -- 
A: No, th -- the -- I™ll tell you 
exactly. The claims -- the total 
agreement was three billion 450 
million deutsche marks. In those days it was the equivalent of 712 million dollars. You -- you 

take the sum, divide it by 4.2. Th-That was th
e ratio. Can you imagine?  Today the dollar is a 
fraction of -- of the Euro, but -- so -- 

Q: Can you hold that?  Cause we ha
ve to change the tape -- 

A: Okay, and I™m gonna  -- 

Q: -- and we™ll start right -- right there.

Q: S-So I™ll give you a sense of -- of th
e people. You wanted to go back to -- 
A: Yeah, I wanted to go back to, because you asked me  earlier about who -- who were the people 
involved in -- in this whole proc
ess and -- and I think I -- I -- I 
didn™t answer it as fully as I th-
think I -- I want to and I should. But as I say, 
whatever has been accomplished i-initially and 
since and now and I™m s ure going forward, is a produc
t and the result of a 
collective effort of a 
group of individuals who are invo
lved in a professional lay cap
acity that depends upon which 
individual and what phase and at what stage o-of -- of the various processes. When I -- when we 

spoke earlier about the a-anteceden
ts of all of these programs in
 the imme diate postwar period, 
and th-the -- the ma in issues had to be negotiate
d with the U.S. governme nt as the most powerful 
of the -- of the allied victorious powers, there 
were essentially four Je
wish organizations that 
worked together in that effort, and that was th
e American Jewish Committ ee, the American Joint 

Distribution Committee, the Jewish
 Agency for Palestine at that time , and the World Jewish 
Congress. And -- and these were essentially, as fa
r as the -- the Jewish ag
ency for -- the Jewish 
Agency for Palestine were the American repres
entatives, and of cour
se Nahum Goldmann, who 
lived in the United Stat es at that time and was 
the chairman of the -- executive of the Jewish 

agency in addition to being the chairman of 
the -- executive of the World Jewish Congress and 
so on and I -- I ma y be off by a year or two 
[indecipherable] the titles, but in those two 
organizations they played a leading role already at 
th -- at the -- at the e
nd of the war. And -- and 
of the two American organizations, of course, th
ey were domi c iled in New York, and -- and th-
their -- particularly the American Jewish comm
i ttee had a -- a legal council in Wa shington, a 
man wh-who was also at  times with the Stat e 
Departme nt, his name  was Seymour Ruben. And -- 
and the American je -- th-the Jewish agency 
on these issues was represented by their American 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
77 
 
 
council, a man called Maurice Bookstein, who was 
sitting -- who was living in New York as an 
American Jew. And -- a -- a -- 
and then of the -- the World Je
wish Congress, there were two 
brothers, Jacob and Nehemi ah Robins on. They bot
h came from Lithuania. Jacob was already an 
international lawyer of some  standing in the 
-- in the 1930™s in -- in Lithuania, and Nehemi ah 
was a outstanding scholar and he headed up the Wo
rld Jewish Congress, created an institute of 
Jewish affairs it was called, it™s offi cial title
. It  was a -- a research facility, a research 
organization which Nehemi ah led and directed. 
And in ma ny, ma ny wa ys he was -- he was the 
co-conceptualizer of -- of a lot of -- of what we
 developed subsequently as our specific programs 
for de ma nds, etcetera. In addition to that, and of c
ourse in the -- in the --  
in the Joint Distribution 
Committee, they had the co-council in Europe as 
well, a ma n called Jerome  Jacobsen and -- and 
people in -- in New York in the headquarters -- 
oh, for God sakes. Come  to me  in a mi nute. Eli 
Rock. E-l-i R-o-c-k. And of course, Mo-Moses Lev
itt is the -- as the chie
f executive in -- in the 
American Jewish Committee, the he ad of the -- 
their international depa
rtment was a prominent 
European lawyer of Polish origin called Si-Sim
on Siegel. And his deputy was the father of the 
recent -- of Alan Habershi. Would you believe
? His name was Eugene Habershi, he was a 
Hungarian diplomat and the son of the conservati
ve chief rabbi of Hungary, okay?  I be -- I me t 
Alan Habershi -- Alan Ha bershi when [indeciphera
ble] would bring him to the office at age 15 or 
whatever. So anyway, I g -- I -- I give you the -- 
the -- the players at th
at point, because although 
they came from different corners organizati
onally and so on, and there were no previous 
structural arrangeme nts for cooperative activit
ies, around this issue, 
these people and these 
individuals were closer together
 and very, very, very effective.
 And of course by the -- by the 
time it came to 1952, or fi -- or ™51 and -- and ™5
2 negotiations, by that 
time  of course, Ben 
Ferencz and I were involved out 
of the operation in Germany i t self of the successor organization, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
78 
 
 
and we worked with all these people because
 the American Jewish Committee and the World 
Jewish Congress. And -- and the American Join t Distribution Committee, and whom did I leave 
out?  And the Jewish agency were
 founding me mbers of the JRSO.  
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Every year when we would elect officers in 
the g -- in the j -- JRSO, 
one year the chairman 
was a g -- a JDC designee, and the next year wa
s a Jewish agency designee and so on. So by the 
time the Claims Conference came into being, ther
e was already a -- a group of -- of experts, 
professionals plus laypeople in 
these respective organizations, w
ho were involved in the subject 
ma tter. And the delegation was expanded in The 
Hague because we brought in people from 
England. First of all it was important, reme mber, we 
had to make sure that the principle, western 
powers were -- were there, and it was important al
so to us. So a -- a ma n who was a me mber of 

parliame nt, whose name  was Alec Easterma n, who 
was me mber of our delegation, at least that 
he -- he didn™t sit all the time  in The Hague, he ha
d to be an -- an MP in -- in London, too, but -- 
and what was important, the German refugee or
ganization called the Council of Jews from 
Germany was headquartered in London. And Rabb
i Leo Baeck, after whom
 the Baeck Institute 
was name d s ubsequently, was, so to say the -- th
e spiritual and the -- and the -- a-and the sort of 
leader of -- of this whole move me nt . So we -- we
 brought in -- in -- into 
the delegation the then 
executive head of their or ganization, a ma n called 
Goldschmi dt, first na me will come  to me  in a 
mi nute. And he was also, of course [i ndecipherabl e] fa miliar with German law. Reme mber, we 

had to negotiate ultima tely, German legal commitm
ents, etcetera. And th-this was -- this was the 
professional team, together with Jerry Jacobse
n, who was council of the JDC sitting in Paris. 
And then of course, the Claims Conference leader
ship itself, the -- wh-which was supervising the 
negotiating, laying out the policies, because we
 couldn™t ha ve 24 organizations being in 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
79 
 
 
permanent session, whereas Jacob Blaustein, who was -- obviously Nahum Goldma nn as the 
president, Jacob Blaustein as the senior vice pr es
ident, he was the head of the American Jewish 
Committee. A -- by today™s standards he would be one
 of the billionaires. In those days he was a 
multi-millionaire [indecipherable] 
Baltimore oil company. Amoco, Amer ican Oil Company, that 
was the Blaustein family. And then Israel Goldst
ein, the head of the American Jewish Congress, 
Rabbi Israel Goldstein, a leading 
conservative rabbi with a large 
congregation on the west side of 
New York, and a leading me mber of the Jewish
 agency executive. I mean, these are people 
[indecipherable]. And Moses Leav
itt who was the -- today would probably be the executive vice 
president of the American Joint Dist ribution Committee. And as I told you, became the chairman 

of our delegation in The Hague. And Bookstein 
[indecipherable] and a ma n called Adolph Held, 
a president of the Jewish Labor Committee. In 
those days, a much more str -- a stronger 
organization than the Jewish La
bor Committee is today, they are 
still an organization covering a 
segment of J e wish life, but you have to know, pa
rticular for our negotiations, during the Nazi 
period, the Je wish Labor Committee in this c
ountry brought so me  of the German social 
democrats, some  of the German trade unionists, ev
en if they were in Sweden and in exile, they 
would raise money and support them financially. 
They had a close, ongoi
ng personal relationship 
with the second largest political 
party in Germany after the wa r, the Social Democratic party. 
And Adolph Held himself, ca me  from the trade uni
on move me nt. He was a senior official of the 
International Ladies Garment Worker™s Union. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: Of Mr. Dubinsky™s union, if that means a
nything to you. And so it was Adolph Held, Jacob 
Blaustein, Israel Goldstein, Na
hum Goldma nn, Frank Goldma nn, who 
was the president of B™nai 
B™rith, which was very important to us at that
 time. And then fr om Britain was Sir Barnett 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
80 
 
 
Janner, who was the chairman of the board of depu
ties of British Jews, who is the oldest Jewish 
communal organization in Britain, I think 
going back to -- to the end of the 18
th
 century or 
some thing, anyway, or maybe -- or maybe the beginning of the 19
th
 century, anyway, one of the -
- I think the oldest central orga
ni zation still exists, still a me mber organi zation of the -- of the 
Claims Conference. They all are. Different
 leadership and so on, but the -- so -- 
Q: You™re saying that it™s not one
 or two people or three people, it
™s -- it™s a hu -- a rather large 
group, and a wide group? 

A: Obviously as the -- a good -- a go
od deal of the -- of the nitty gr
itty and of the really the day 
to day and night and day type of 
work, it always had to co -- to come  down to a smaller number 
of people who had to devote all their time to it.
 Nehemi ah Robinson and -- and then -- and 
myself and Ben Ferencz and I for -- I shou -- I mean
 I -- I took it for granted that Ben Ferencz 
was part of it, although Ben Fere
ncz would shuttle between fur -- between Nurember g and -- and 
-- and The Hague, because he -- the 
-- the -- the -- the -- the WJ -- the 
JRSO had to continue to -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- to operate at that time. We continued to 
operate much past ™52 in -- in -- in Germany. 
Q: What was --- what was your role as what -- wh
at were you supposed to be doing in this?  What 
are the kinds of things you were doing? 

A: I mean, fi rst of all, I was the executive di re
ctor of the Claims  Conf
erence, which means I was 
the chief operating officer of the organization per 
se, because in addition 
to everything else, it 
had to be a functional organization. It had to ha
ve  meetings, and it had committees and it had the 
board. And the mo ment we got money we had to ha
ul out our location apparatus. We  -- we were 

allocating 10 million dollars a year , which in today™s purchasing power we -- was at  least a 

hundred million plus. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
81 
 
 
Q: Lot of money. 
A: Some where between a hundred and 150 milli
on dollars. So we had to build anot her 
machinery for the allocation of funds and soon. And then I continued 
to be the executive 
director of the WJ  -- of the JRSO, parallel f
unction and so forth. And a-as I say, it was -- the 
negotiations themselves were of course a time
 limited operation. After we signed the agreements, 

this group dispersed. 

Q: Right. 

A: And -- and we then continued 
to carry this Claims Conference. We  established immediately 
an office in Germany, headed by f-former Ger man
 lawyer, with -- as we
 always -- we were 
always teased our Israeli friends, the fi rst Jewi
sh embassy in postwar Germany was the Claims  
Conference office in Bonn, because diplo -- believe 
it or  not, diplomatic relations between Israel 
and the Federal Republic were only established 
in 1965, 13 years later. 
The Israel governme nt 
had a purchasing mi ssion, sitting in Cologne, we tr
acked it as a [indecipherable] embassy, but it 
did not have a full status of -- of an embassy. A
nd -- and we then -- our objective then was to see 
that all these commitments were being implemented and we had an agreement with the Germans 

that any draft legislation would come  to us firs
t for comment before it would be -- be presented 
for a vote to the Bundestag. And for decades there was a compensation committee of the 

Bundestag as a standi ng committee, called in 
German the [speaks German here] Ausschuss. 
Ausschuss be ing the German word for committee. 
And then w-we worked periodically, I would 
go from Ne w York for periodic me etings with 
them, and -- but our representative would -- would 
be in daily contact with them. 

Q: Uh-huh. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
82 
 
 
A: And all of the li -- the laws that followed, a
nd they were not one time  pieces of legi slation, 
there was a first compensation law, and there wa
s an amended compensation law, and there was 
subsequently the regulations, and there was a pr
operty restitution law, Germany, on top of the 
military government restitution law for a certai n type of assets which were not covered by the 
initial legislation. And th
en -- and then -- so -- 
Q: So the law become s more compl e x -- 

A: Of course. 

Q: -- and changes over time , right. 

A: When I said to you that there were seven volumes -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- you can come  in my office and see, they 
are like that. They are 
volume s covering the law 
and their implementation. And then th -- reme mb
er, ther e wa s a ma jor judicial machinery. A 

claim for -- if some body filed a claim for a comp
e nsation for imprisonment in the ghetto and the 
concentration camp, it went to an admi nistrative lo
cal regional agency. In
 any of the -- of the 
[indecipherable] in any of the states, they had 
f -- various jurisdiction cl
aims to Israel were 
processed here, and claims from 
the United States there and so on. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: That was first. If they approved, then the ma tte
r was finished. If they 
rejected, it could go to a 
-- to an appellate party to a cour
t of [indecipherabl e] citizens. It 
could go to an appellate court, 
and there was a Supreme  Court, there was 
a high court s -- exclus
ively on issues of 
compensation. 

Q: But these claima nts had to go th
rough the Claims  C
onfere nce first -- 
A: No. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
83 
 
 
Q: -- or th -- they didn™t? 
A: No. 

Q: They could go separa
tely, as individuals? 
A: Everything until 1980 was the individual filing a direct cl aim with the German compensation 

agency. We created an or ganization called the United Restitution Organi zation -- 

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: -- which provided legal aid. 

Q: Right. 

A: And at the peak of its activ
ities, it -- it had a hundred 
thousand claim -- it represented a 
hundred thousand claims in 15 countries. 
Today the URO is a small operation -- 
Q: Oh, that™s right. 

A: -- residual operation in Israel, Canada a
nd -- and the United St
ates and Germany. 
Q: So then, explain what it wa
s that the Claims Conference wa
s doing. What kinds of claims  
were you getting then? 

A: The Claims Conference ne
gotiated the legislation. 
Q: Uh-huh. 

A: Monitored the implementation. 

Q: Right.  

A: Financed the legal aid services machiner
y and -- and continuously fought for expansion 
improve me nt, correction and [indecipherable]. 
I™ll give you the example, at one point the 
processing of the claims were exceedingly slow
, and we brought about some thing that never 

happened in Germany be fore and since. We  had 
the chancellor convene th
e mi nister presidents, 
which would be the equivalent of the governorsof all the states of Germany, it™s like the 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
84 
 
 
president of the United St ates would bring to
gether the 50 governors 
in a two day session, 
because the governors we re responsible for the initi
al admi nistration of the laws. In other words, 
the operating local agencies, the agencies of firs
t admi nistrative were state agencies. And Nahum 
Goldma nn addressed that gathering 
and laid out all of 
our complaints and so on, and -- and cr -- 
and obtained secured commit ments on -- on how to
 accelerate the process [indecipherable] the 
claims. That was the claims end of it. On the a
llocation part of it, the money was given -- we had 
an agreement under which -- from The Hague 
days -- the Luxembourg days under which we 
received mo ney for allocations. We  had to furn
ish annual reports to the German governme nt as 
to what we did with the money, and how it was done
 and so on. And we had some  difficult issues 
with them as well, particularly
 issues wi -- about which we c
ould not write very much about, 
because we had to use -- we found that we had to 
use some  of these funds 
to assist Nazi victims 
behind the Iron Curtain. 

Q: Mm-h m.  
A: And that was verbote -- not ve
rboten so much from the German
 side, but the Soviets were -- 
were violently opposed to it, and so on. And we had 
to do it in such a way that we couldn™t ma ke 
it public, and we had to get the c
onsent of the German governme nt 
to do it, etcetera, I mean, we 
can talk about that one day, but then in some  of
 t hose were the ways is written up in the book by 
[indecipherable] Zweig, Ronald Zweig on -- on our location. 

Q: Mm-hm. But let -- let me ask you this. There 
wa s a period of time, and ma ybe it still goes on, 
that when you gave a fair amount of money so 
that i-it would help Yad Vashem. Am I correct?  
That it was established --  

A: From -- from day one . 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
85 
 
 
Q: From day one. So there -- there are allotm
ents of money that you -- that the Claims 
Conference was giving to certain -- 
A: Oh, absolutely. 

Q: Right?  But you™re saying that 
individual claims did not come  
through the Claims  Conference? 
A: No, the individual claims -- in
itially the individual claims ba
sed on the legislation that was 
approved, based on the agreements which were 
approved in Luxembour g, wherein the for m of 
individuals filing 
cl ai ms di r e ct  -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- from t he German admi nistrative agencies, 
and subsequently, if n
eed be, carrying into 
German courts. 

Q: Right. Okay. 

A: It was until -- it was not until 1980 -- 

Q: With the hardship fund. 
A: -- when the hardship fund was created -- 
Q: Right. 

A: -- and when we came to the Germans prior 
to that and said, you have to open the filing 
deadlines for the benefit of the 
Holocaust survivors who are comi
ng out of the Soviet Union, and 
who were barred by -- by these laws from filing 
claims because the -- the geographic jurisdiction 
of the f -- ger -- of the Ge rman comp ensati on laws which came out from our Luxembourg 

agreements, were limited to -- to -- to the wester
n world. It did not pene
trate the Iron Curtain. 
Q: Right.  

A: Okay?  

Q: Yeah. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
86 
 
 
A: We  did not, as I told you in the car, we did 
not prevail with that. Nahum Goldma nn™s traveled 
for four years. He and -- and -- and our collea
gues in Germany, I mean, we had extraordinary 
representatives in Germany, out
standing people. There was a ma
n called Aroz Kashenstein who 
was -- who was our representative 
in Germany for nearly 30 years,
 I would say. Then there was 
his predecessor, another German lawyer. His suc
cessor, a Czech lawyer and so on. They -- they 
were our fulltime negotiators on the spot. And th 
-- it was only at that  point when the Germans 
said, look, we  finished the [indecipherable] we 
-- our admi nistrator apparatus is finished. We  
don™t want any more our courts to be loaded, beca
use they had to -- they had the whole judicial 
structure. From the courts [indecipherable] 
instance through a Supreme Court. Germany, even 
today does that every single Supreme Court on 
those subjects. There™s 
a high in-institutional 
court, there™s a high social secu
rity court, there™ s a 
high labor court. They have for each ma jor 
area the equivalent of a Supreme Court. In th
is country everything goe
s to one court. And 
Karlsruhe is the seat of all of
 these parallel high courts. So 
if you go to Karlsruhe you can go 
from -- from one high court to the next high cour
t. And there was for years and years a oberster -
- he™s a good [indecipherable]a high compensation court. 

Q: And that stopped eventually. 

A: In any event, so only from that point on, we
 were very reluctant to
 do it. And I can tell you 
obviously why, because it wasn™t the pi -- part of money which said here you have at your 

discretion, you decide the cr
iteria. We had to negotiate
 under great -- under intensive 
negotiations the criteria to this day on various programs, and then we are committed to apply 

these criteria. And the -- 

Q: And it™s not yours. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
87 
 
 
A: -- and the German -- and the German -- the 
German co-controller general equivalent can 
come  at any time and inspect our records. 
Q: Right. 

A: And we kn -- we knew -- I™ll give one si-s
imple [indecipherable] example. We have a 
program under which we pay pensions, under a 
so-called article two program, which was 
established after the unif
ication of Germany. One of the criter
ia is you had to be six months in 
the concentration camp. And if
 you were five month in the 
concentration camp, you were out. 
And for a Jewish organization called Conference 
of Jewish [indecipherable] Germany to send a 
letter to somebody who was five mo nth in th
e concentration camp, you 
-- your application for 
compensation is rejected, is a mi nor pleasure. 

Q: Yeah. We have to stop the tape.

time a survivor complains that compensation is 
inadequate, they will never have an ar gument fr om me.ﬂ 
A: That™s correct . 

Q: And you still believe this? 

A: That™s correct. Particularly 
in the area of -- of 
personal suffering and personal injuries. How 
can one put a dollar number on psychological,
 emotional, and on -- and also physical 
consequences? We  always say, and I™m not alone 
in that, that what -- what we succeeded to 
some  extent is to provide a measure of compensa
tion, some  degree, combined with what I said to 
you before, which is not tangible, but wh-what -- 
but to me  extremely important, and that is the 
basic acknowledgment on the part of either the g
overnme nt or the entity
 or  the agency that 
provides compensation, that it had 
responsibility, legal, moral,
 but responsibility. And on the 
other hand, among the hundreds of thousands of su
rvivors, not everybody was able to ma ke the 
kind of economi c to build a new existence for on
eself, economi cally, prof
essional, business-wise 
or otherwise that -- that the compensation that 
they obtained for that -- for ma ny it has genuine 
economic significance. For people for whom -- who as
 I said to you before, whether it is in the 
depth of Brooklyn or -- or in th
e -- or in the resettlement towns 
of Israel, or -- or in eastern 
Europe, or wherever it is, when the compensation 
comi ng as a result of our negotiations and so 
on, ma y equal and exceed old age assistance or Social
 Security, or whatever it is, and it ma kes a 
difference between marginal existence in a late st
age of people™s lives, an
d a sense of -- of some  
acceptable mi ni mu m with a -- with a mi ni mu m of -- of
 -- of dignity and of 
-- and of self respec t 
in a sense that an indi vidual can 
have, that is of great importance.
 And -- and particularly in this 
stage where the vast ma jority of the survi
vors are 80 and over, reme mber anybody who was born 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
89 
 
 
in, let™s say who was 10 years old when World 
War II broke out in Poland, okay?  Born in 1929. 
That individual today is
 78, okay?  This is a child survivor
. There are organizations of child 
survivors. Kindertransport peop
le, okay?  This is the young end of
 the -- of this population. And 
particularly in the western wo
rld, with progress of -- of me di
cal care and so on, people live 
longer. I say people exist longer, you know, to me  
there is a great distin
ction between those two 
words. But people are there longer, in mo -- re
quiring much more care and attention for their 
me dical needs and so on, with a greater strain and 
s -- on -- on their financial resources. So in a -- 
in a strange way, some  of the compe nsation bene
fits today for the peop
le who ended up retiring 
on a -- on a very modest basis and in some parts 
of the world on a below modest basis, or in a 
non-existent basis, th-this compensation is -- is 
truly meaningful, and is of great importance. We  
negotiate periodically co
st of living adjustme nts on the pens
ions. One of -- I 
think one of the 
brilliant  things that we did in the -- in The Hague, 
is we wrote in a clause that the pensions, that 

the compensation pensions will be adjusted on a co
st of living basis as the pensions of civil 
servants of Germany, because we knew that the civil servants of Germa ny have a powerful 

organization and they will fight for cost of livi
ng adjustme nts. And we got the Germans to agree 
that the compensation -- we knew it is the compensa
tion pensions will be adjusted cost  of living-
wise in the same  percentage as those. So I say th
at to illustrate that the -- the economic impact 
for certain categories of survivor
s was and is important. And as I 
say in some  -- in some strange 
way, becomi ng more important now for those who were
 to retire in a -- on a -- on a very limited 
basis.  

Q: Can I ask you if -- the description that you gave
 towards the end of the 
last tape, when there 
are certain regulations that you had to follow on 
the hardship fund because those were -- those 
were regulations ma de up by the German governme nt. Do you --

A: When the [indecipherable] we
 have to be more precise. 
Q: Mm. 
A: Every agreement is a compromi se. 

Q: Right. 

A: Even when the United States won the war 
on an unconditional surrender, it couldn™t force 
upon Germa ny all that it may have set out to 
force upon Germany, and t hen think of -- any 
agreement is a compromi se. 

Q: Okay. 

A: And a compromi se means that after X efforts to
 negotiate, if you agree on a settleme nt, that is 
what you have agreed.  

Q: Right. 

A: And you have to have the -- 
the -- the moral courage and the 
-- and the honesty to say in the 
best judgment of this body, like -- like a congress, lik
e a legislature or whatev
er it is. In the best 
judgment of this body, this agreem
ent had to be accepted in the for m in which it was finally 
negotiated out. 

Q: Right. But this is my ques tion. Di d you ever get discouraged? 

A: No. 

Q: No? Not in all these years? 

A: Wh -- what do you mean by discouraged? 

Q: Discouraged that you -- 

A: To say gave up?  I™ll give you a classic exam
ple. In 1974, the two Germanys, East and We st 
were admitted to the United Nations. Following that the United States establishe d dipl omatic 

relations with East Germany. We  
assisted and we had the support 
of the U.S. governme nt, at that 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
91 
 
 
time the assistant secretar y for European affairs was Mr. Hart man, telling the East Germans that 
the United St ates will not enter into di plomatic relations unless the East  Germans will agree to 

negotiate with the Claims Conference concerni ng
 issues of co mpensation, something like that. 
The Communist East  Germans resisted it v- vi
olently. They are a state and they are not 
negotiating with some  non -- non-governme ntal agen
cy, or some thing like that. Fi nally, th-they -
- they knew that they couldn™t ge t around it, so th
ey created an anti-Fascist committee to be our 
non-governme ntal partner. And from 1974 to 
1989, we negotiated with the bloody German -- 

East Germans, and w -- and we were getting 
nowhere. We  we re periodically going there every 

year at the time of the general assembly of the United Nations.
 The foreign mi nister of East 
Germany would come  here, and on Park Avenue 
[indecipherable] we would meet. Ben Ferencz 

and Israels -- and Israel Miller
 and Sa ul Kagan and whatever, a
nd in 1987 I think I told you we 
had -- they officially invited us as their guests 
for negotiations with them in Germany, and they 

wanted that we should deliver to 
them most favored nations status 
in the United States so they -- 
and then ma ybe they would consider doing it. At
 one point Benny went for a me eting with the 
anti-Fascist committee and totally unexpectedly
 was handed a one million dollar check to -- to 
the Claims Conference that we should, with a milli
on dollars, help needy Nazi victims in -- in the 
United States. Within 48 hours the check was se
nt back to the German -- to the German 
Communists, and believe me , through
 this whole period, people in 
our board were telling Israel 
Miller and Be n Ferencz and Saul Kagan and a fe
w other people, stop banging your head against 
this wall, nothing will happen. We  never let up. 
We didn™t accomplish anything, but we never let 
up. We  -- there were poi -- there were mo ments wher
e the -- where they were ma king offers to us 
which we -- of the cali -- cal --
 caliber which -- which were unacceptable, but you can get really 
discouraged, you know?  You go back on the back -- ev
en with the west Germans, as I told you, 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
92 
 
 
between 1975, when détente came in, again you see,
 you got to relate that
 to [indecipherable] 
development. Détente, Helsinki, negotiations between -- between President Ford and the 
Helsinki agreements, and the great pr essure with 
the Jackson-Vanik pressure to let Jews out of -- 
emigrate from the Soviet Union. Among them, 
I don™t have to tell 
you, hundred -- tens of 
thousands of -- of vict -- of Holocaust survivor
s of -- of -- of the most
 horrible persecution. Th-
The survivors of the [indecipherable] gr
oup, and I mean I -- with you I can talk it 
[indecipherable] than that. We  ca me  back to 
the Germans and said, you have to open the filing 
period of the compensation laws. These are 
not people who were lazy. It was forced 

[indecipherable] they were barred by your laws 
and by your provisions from f-filing claims. We  
could not get the opposition, we could not get 
the governme nt to agree. We dismantled the 
machinery, we cannot do any more. We couldn™t 
get Willie Brandt, who certainly was a -- Willie 
Brandt who went to Wa rsaw on his knees, you 
know, a -- ap -- apol
ogizing on behalf of 
Germany for what has been done to -- to the --
 in the Wa rsaw ghetto 
to the Jews of Poland. 
Couldn™t budge him, couldn™t budge the -- the ch
r -- the Christian demo
c r at opposition. Couldn™t 
bud -- budge his successor who was Helmut Schmid
t, another Social Democrat. Finally, after 
five years practically -- and be
lieve me , people are now, and -- a
nd I don™t -- I -- I™m not being 
critical of anybody -- you know, if y
ou come  to meetings a few times a year and whatever it is, 
and you -- and you hear the same  -- the same  sad s
ong about we me t with this one, we me t with 
that one, we met with this parliamentarian, and th
at politician. We  were here and we were there, 
and we had the press conference, and we did this
 and that. And what ha
ve you got to show?  And 
when finally, finally they came up wi th this 
hardship fund one time payme nt and you, Claims 
Conference, admi nister it. And Nahum Goldma nn 
turned to me  and said, ﬁNow you gotta set up 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
93 
 
 
an organization.ﬂ Which as I said to you before, you -- an organization which would have to tell 
some  people no. Without judi
cial recourse, by the way. 
Q: Right. 

A: So -- but if you believe that -- 
that there is some thing that --
 that you cannot leave -- that you 
cannot put aside, then you do as l
ong as -- as your institutional stre
ngth is there, as your physical 
strength is there, as your emotional streng
th is there. Not easy. Not easy at all. 
Q: You said a long time  ago this wasn™t a job to you. 

A: Ah. 

Q: This is some thing else, right? 

A: This is not a job you -- this 
is some thing that -- that -- th
at you do because -- because within 
you, you have no alternative. For 
yourself. You don™t get rich in these jobs, I can assure you. 
And -- but ultimately, you -- you know, took very personally. Ultimately each of us has to live 

with his own self.  
Q: And you couldn™t if you di
d -- if you didn™t do this. 
A: I don™t think so. 
Q: Yeah.  

A: I c -- I c --  I will tell you this much; I co
uld not divorce my self voluntarily from it. I could 
visualize myself bei
ng in a lay capacity. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: I could visualize, I don™t 
know, the organization decided to 
retire me , I mean, you know, the 
old gray ma re it ain™t what she used to be, you know
, so -- but they haven™t yet reached this wise 
decision, so -- but -- 
but [indecipherable] 
Q: Do you think there were any mi stakes ma de? 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
94 
 
 
A: Of course mi stakes. I mean, th-the -- the answ
er to the question of whether it would have been 
possible to achieve more -- 

Q: Right. 

A: -- I would -- I have to be the last person, or
 those of us who were 
-- I mean if Nehemi ah 
Robinson would be today alive, if
 -- if all of my colleagues or 
-- or -- or [indecipherable] and -- 
and -- and -- and my -- in -- in our new -- in our
 current professional lead
ership, I cannot answer 
that. We  think that we tried to do our utmost. 

Q: Right. 

A: Is our utmost good enough?  Coul d some body acco
mplish more?  I would be the last person to 
say no. 

Q: Right. 

A: It would be presumptuous, it would be arrogant. And you know, there are elements beyond -- 

beyond real -- real objective determination. There 
are mo me nt s where we -- when we broke off 
negotiations. And we had to decide, are we going 
to go back to it or not. And -- and it -- and it 
was always -- and it had to be a compromi se
. The reality in life, whether it™s Jewish 
organizationa l life, whether it is American public 
life, whether it is -- is anything else, ultimately 
it™s a compromi se. There are people who consider 
this a dirty word. I™ve ne
ver considered this a 
dirty word. I consider this a fact of life and th
e issue is always a determination which is very 
often a subjective de termination as to what is 
an acceptabl e compromi se. That™s where the issue 
lies. 

Q: Right.  

A: Now, these kind of speeches, or  these kind of 
st atements will not get you elected to the -- as 
the chief dogcatcher over there, because u-unfortuna
tely political life, and I™m sorry to say at 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
95 
 
 
least maybe -- maybe it™s a sign of we™re ge -- of we™re getting old, but by the standards of 
political discourse, from -- from the days, let™s 
say in th -- in American standards of the New 
Deal to today is by and large a record of ever 
lower -- of ever lower -- 
lower sinking levels and 
standards of political discourse.  

Q: Mm-h m.  

A: And that is heartbreaking to me . If you stand 
up and make  a sober, intelligent st atement, this 

is political poison. Correct? 

Q: Correct. Well, there -- we c
ould stay here for at least another 10 hours and at some  point we 
have to stop. 

A: Sure. 

Q: So there™s endless questions I could ask 
you, but I want to thank you so much for being 
willing to take the time -- 

A: Look, I™ll tell you this much, what you -- wh
at you can do. First of all, I want to know 
whether I -- I -- I know a -- a transc
ript come s alo -- come s late, but
 I hope that a 
-- a copy of the 
[indecipherable] tape can be av
ailable eventually, or the -- 
Q: Oh yeah, yes. 

A: The other thing that I have to
 think about and you have to give
 me a little bit of time that -- 
not very much, is what is for general public cons
umption, what I™m not sure that [indecipherable] 
I told you that™s a very -- you can
 tell me it™s a 
personal hang-up. 
Q: No, it™s your personal decision. 

A: No, I t -- because there are 
people -- there are people who -- 
you know, whose personal life is 
some thing that -- that they have no problem shari
ng with the world, or displaying to the world, or 
even -- or even enjoying doing that. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
96 
 
 
Q: And you™re very private. 
A: I -- ma ybe unfortunately even for me , belong 
to the people who mourn 
in private, literally. 
Q: Yeah. Well, for that reason -- 

A: A-After mi dnight. 

Q: After what? 

A: I say, after mi dnight. You know, we a
ll have characteristics, good or bad. 
Q: Right. Well, I thank you for ev
en being willing to try this. 

A: And wha t  I -- what I say to you is also seri
ously, because I think of you as I think of it right 

now, is you™ll try to put things together, there will be some  kind of holes or gaps, or simply 

things that have to be connected. Just pick up th
e phone, send me  an emai l, or whatever it is, I 
will --  

Q: Okay, or I™ll come  to New York and visit with you. How™s that? 

A: By all means, by all means. I said it to so
me body here before that -- I said -- doesn™t apply 
here at all, but I am, particularly in the la
st 10 years, I am very often approached by young 

historians, by -- by people writing Ph.D.™s and 
so on, from this country, from Israel, from 
Germany, by the way. You would be amazed how 
many young German historians are seriously 
studying the Holocaust. Seriously. 

Q: No, I know. 

A: With a great inner commit ment. We have an 
office in Germany now that -- that has been in 
operation since 1952, that™s 55 years. The vast 
majority of our staff was German, German 
German. 

Q: Mm-h m.  

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
97 
 
 
A: Not German Jews, German German. We ha d 
-- we have some  Jews, obviously, and we had 
people and ha ve people who are deeply co
mmitted to what we are trying to do. 
Q: Right. 
A: Inner commit ment. 

Q: Right. 

A: In some  -- in some  cases and in some  ways
 mo re intenselythan 
a Jew would do. And I don™t 
say it critically of the Jew. For -- for the Jew it 
is -- for -- for -- let™s say for a Jew particul arly 
some how related to or exposed to Holocaust survi
vors or some thing like that
, it™s almost sort of 
ma tter of course, if you will, or ho-how else
. But young Germans who feel very de eply the 

responsibility. I mean, one of -- one
 of our best lawyers, he rea
lly battling our battle, he is a 
youngish -- or -- or at least by my standards, he
 is around 50, c-close to it, young German lawyer 
with -- not only with that he is a brilliant la
wyer as a lawyer, but -- but with a real inner 
commit me nt  to this thing. So it -- to -- to go back, and what I was -- wanted to tell you s-simply 
is that any Ph.D. student who calls me  or sends me  an email or wants to see me , I ac -- 
some ti me s go to Germany and I meet some body s e ven o™clock in the morning because that™s the 

one hour I can spend with them. 

Q: Right. 

A: And so to me  this aspect of it 
is of in -- tremendous importance.  
Q: Right. 

A: Because not only that -- that the -- the hi-- the history of the period, the teaching of this 

period, the -- th-the -- what I ca
ll the broad lessons of it, human 
lessons, not only in Jewish life, 
but in the -- in the -- in the worl
d at large, are crucial to go pa
st the lifetime of the -- of the 
survivors. 

USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0514  
98 
 
 
Q: Right. 
A: And -- and the only place to look to that are the teachers, are the academics, are the -- are the 

governme nts, for instance there is now, as you 
know, the international task force on Holocaust 
education, I think it™s a fant
astic, tremendous de velopment. 
Q: Mm-h m.  

A: To introduce that subject ma
tter into the -- in
to the public school systems of the world, and of 
Europe in particular, is -- is -- 
is a tremendous goal and objective. 
Q: I think we  have to stop the tape. 

A: You can stop it, it™s -- doesn™t -- 

Q: Do -- do you want --
