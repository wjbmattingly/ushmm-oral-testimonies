W arren Marcus:  Good afternoon.  My name is Warren Marcus.  I'm today's host of the 
mus eum's  public program

.  Thank  you for joining us .  This  is  our 14th year of 
our program.  Our

This  2013 s eas on of
 First Person
 
is  made pos s ible through t he generos it y of  the Louis  
Frank lin Smith Foundation to whom we are grateful for again s pons oring
 First Person
.  I'm 
going t he add that it's  a personal honor for me to interview Henry as  the firs t y ear of
 First 
Person
 
many y ears  ago was  s pons ored by  my family in honor of my father who had pas s ed 
away the previous year.  So this is a very important program for me. 

First 
Person
 is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share 
wit h us t heir first-hand accounts of  their experience during the Holocaust.  Each guest, like 

Henry, serves  here as  a volunteer at the mus eum.  Our program will continue 
until mid 
Augus t.   The museum's  webs it e at www.us hmm. org provides information about eac h of our 

upc oming
 First Person
 guests. 
Henry will share with us his
 First Person
 
ac c ount as  a Holoc aus t s urviv or for about 45 
minutes.   As time allows towards the end of 
the program we'll have time for any and all 

questions.  

The life s tories of Holoc aust survivors  truly trans c end the decades .  What you're about to 

hear from Henry is one indiv idual's  ac c ount of the Holocaus t.   W e have prepared a brief 

s lide pres entation to help you with his  introduc tion, assuming I  c an use it. 
 
 

Henry was  born on A pril 1s t, 1928.  His  f amily lived in a s mall one
-
family hous e that s erved 

as  both the family's  res idence and a tailor s hop.  He was  the youngest of nine c hildren.

The Germans  invaded Poland in 1939.  By 1942, at the age of 13, Henry was s ent wit h his  

family to do forc ed labor in a munitions  f actory.  He was  deported to Buna

Monowitz  Labor 
Camp at Aus chwitz  and later to the Flossenbürg Camp in Germany.
  
At the age of 17 he 
was  liberated and one year later he immigrated to the United States .
 
Please welcome Henry Greenbaum.

W arren Marc us:  We have s o muc h to talk about.  I'v e k nown Henry, I've been lucky enough 
to k now Henry  for many yea
rs and work with him in many presentations and he could tell us 
all his  life s tory  for hours  and hours and hours .  We c an't do that.  So what I'm going to 

s ugges t  is  we're going to talk about s everal topic s from his  life and he'll share an anecdote 

wit h us
 
or t wo.   And I 've already  apologiz ed to Henry that I may have to interrupt him jus t for 
the s ake of time.  So the topic s  will inc lude, y ou k now, life before the war and s ome 

bac k ground about his  family.  We s aw s ome pic tures  of his  s isters .  What happened
 
when 
W orld War II s tarted.  Life in the ghetto.  A nd moving to the labor c amp,  the death train and 

then to Aus chwitz  and then t he Death Marc h and liberat ion.  So we'v e got  a lot to talk  about 

and hopefully  you'll hav e lots  of ques tions .  So thank  you for 
y our patience with me ahead of 
time, Henry.  

Tell us  about y our f amily and what life was  lik e before t he Germans  inv aded in 1939, please.
 
>> Before the war we had a normal upbringing.  We were a f amily of nine c hildren.  Three 

s ons and a daughter
 -- 
three 
sons  and s ix  girls .  And we had a normal upbringing.  Very 
religious at home.  I n fac t, we didn't liv e too far from the synagogue, about t wo block s  away 

from there.  I look ed lik e a normal Jewis h little boy.   Had my c urls  here underneat h and my 

tassels sticking out here.  Never bare headed.  Always wore a hat.  My main thing was to 

play ball, most ly soccer with other children.  Non-
J ewish, J ewis h, we'd play around wit h the 
public  sc hool.  I went  to a religious  s c hool.   Lik e a normal upbringing.  We were a n
ice, 
happy family.  But of c ours e all of t his  ended September of '39 when the Germans  inv aded 

our town.  Didn't tak e them too long to put on the y ellow Star of David on the bac k and the 

front from the babies up to I don't c are how old you are.  You would b
e identified as the 
Jewish with the yellow star.  Jewish everywhere.  I  had my curls, my tassels and they didn't 

have to do that, but they did it any way.  Who c ould tell them what to do.  That was  their job

to do.
 
W arren Marc us:  How old were you when the 
war stated?
 
Henry Greenbaum:  I was  two months  s hy of 12.  And t hen after that went bac k  to public  
school t he teachers would say no Jews allowed in school.  I had the yellow Star of David 

and they  wouldn't let me c ome to s chool anymore after that.  So then
 
after they did that, they  
s topped us  from play ing ball, lik e a c urfew.  Had t o be in the hous e at suc h
-
and
-such time.  

They would not allow us  in the park .  We c ouldn't use the train or bus es .  You c ouldn't leave 

your
 -- 
y ou had to s t ay  put wherev er you were.  You were never allowed to leave, period.
 
W arren Marc us:  Henry, c an y ou t ell us  about your parents?  W e heard about your sis ters .  

Your mom and dad a little bit ? 

Henry Greenbaum:  My  parents ?
 
W arren Marcus:  Right. 

Henry Greenbaum:  My  father was  a c
aretak er in t he sy nagogue.  My mom was  bus y tak ing 
c are of t he c hildren at home, c ook ing, busy.  We didn't hav e any was hing mac hines  lik e we 

have in Americ a here.  Every thing was  done by hand.  When you hav e a big load, you hav e 

six children -- 
ac tually ni
ne, but they didn't all live with us at the end bec ause we had t wo 
married s is ters  and then one brother was  in the Polis h Army and then a few of them were 

older but my mom kept busy was hing and c leaning and c ook ing.  That's all s he did.
 
W arren Marc us:  So t he war stats and what's  the immediate impac t on y ou and y our family?
 
Henry Greenbaum:  The impac t on me, I  was s c ared to deat h.   I didn't unders tand what the 

war meant.  What did I know, I was more interest ed playing games wit h other children.  I 

didn't r
ealize what the war
 -- what's it all about.  But the parents were listening to a small 
little radio, maybe six inches by ten inches little radio and at t he end they -- 
y ou were not 
allowed to -- 
t he Germans  c ame, y ou c ould not listen t o any radio at all.  
You were not

allowed to.  So you did the bes t, the parents  remembered World War I, they said it was n't 
that bad.  They coming, they're not going to be s o bad.  They didn't realize they  were going 

to be s uc h a mes s  like what they did.
 
W arren Marc us:  So t he
 
front c omes  towards  you and what happens ?  You were out side 
and
 -- 
Henry Greenbaum:  W hen the Germans  entered, the f ather was  already pas s ed away  two 

months  before the war.  My mom was  very protec t ive.  What she did, s he got a neighbor, we 

got a hors e and
 
buggy and t hey took  us  t o a farm.   She s aid let's  go to the farm and avoid 
the taking over the city by the Germans because this way nobody will get hurt.  B ecause we 

were not too far away from a railroad station.  Usually they bomb that.  So my mom was 

pr
otective.  We all piled up.  Not the married sisters.  They had their husbands to t ake care 
of.  Myself, my t hree sisters, my single ones, my mom and we all took the horse and buggy 

and we went to the f arm ten miles  away.  While we were there, on the s ec ond day , all of a 

s udden we heard a lot of bombardment bec aus e we were not that far away.  We c ould hear 

all that.  Myself and my  brother were out in the morning prett y  early to eat break fas t.  

Breakfast was there in the farm, we were not used to t he man's h
ous e.  My brother and I 

went outs ide and were s till tomatoes  on t he vine.   Took  us  big clus ter of tomato of f the vine.  

The farmer gav e us  a piec e of bread and that was our break f as t what we ate.  All of a 

s udden we saw a Polis h s oldier c oming t hrough with
 
a lot of medals  on him.  Came through 
and what happened, I s howed I don't k now why my  brother k new his  firs t name.  He c alled 

him by his  firs t name.  Maybe he was  one of those guards  in the guarding the c ity,  I don't 

k now that.  He might have been one of 
our clients, I don't know that eit her.  But he knew his 
name.  Said what are you running from?  He as ked the s oldier.  He s aid the German Army is 

three k ilometers  c oming this  way and then he s aid he didn't want to get caught by  the

German Army so he was ru
nning in the oppos ite direc tion.  I could not believe my ears .  My  
older brother said is it ok ay if I go along with you?  He knew him s omehow, he k new his  
name.  So the soldier said be my guest.  You want to come with me, it's all right.  S o I -- like 

I sa y, I couldn't believe it.  I chased after him for t wo miles.  I said why would he want to 

leave me?  I just lost my father, he's my father figure, he's the oldest of the children, the 

s ec ond oldest, why  would he leav e me here?  I couldn't unders tand that. 
 So I followed him, 

tried to hide behind bus h s os  he wouldn't s ee me but I still run after him.  A couple of miles  

finally ev ery time I s tuc k  my head out, go bac k  to y our mother, go bac k to your mot her, 

c ons tantly s c reaming go back to y our mother.  I did n
ot listen to him, of course.  B ut once 

the s oldier wit h all t he medals  on him put his  hands  on the front of his  f ac e, go bac k to your 

mother.  I said okay.  I went back t o my mom.  I went back in t here and told her t he news, 

what happened.  David dis appeared.  He was s uppos ed to take c are of the t ailor shop, s mall 

little s hop.  Nev ertheles s  he knew what he was  doing there.  With him going, who was  going 

to tak e c are of the t ailor s hop bec aus e of t he brot hers  was  in t he Polis h Army already.  She 

was crying.  
B ut s he c almed down.  She
 
--
 
he disappeared.  I don't k now what's left  of the 
war.  I didn't k now what happened to him.
 
And then we pac ked up and went bac k  t o our town.  Brok en glas ses  of  c ours e in the house 

of the shop.  Mom's  always  right, somebody  c ould have got hurt.  But nobody  did.   W e 

c leaned up and went bac k  to normal.  Was  s c ared to death of t hos e Naz i s oldiers .  They 

have a gun on them, the helmets , with the boots .  They were
 --  
they were s cary looking to 
me.  They looked like Goliaths to me.  
I was  a little frightened of them.   They  didn't bother 

me yet.  But then it didn't tak e it too long t hey put us  on the y ellow Star of Dav id.  And then 

after that, they  round us  up, the people that lived near t he sy nagogue, they  thought that all 

the Jews 
lived around there in the area.   So they  barbed wire us  around fiv e foot fenc e but

they didn't make a fenc e, jus t piled up barbed wire around the three
-block perimeter, small 
little block.  O nce we were in there the only way you can come out there is becau
se we 
prepared ours elves.  We heard rumors  from out of  town, if you had a job in the fac tories  it 

might be bett er for you.  So almost like a life saver, my f ather was still alive he approached 

one of t he c us tomers of ours  who came in.  He happened to be either a manager or owner 

of the munitions  fact ory.  And my father, he as k ed him,  c an you give my k ids  a job in there?  

He says how many do you have?  Three of my sist ers and myself.  We already had IDs.  

That c ame handy lat er on.  The only way  we c ould c ome
 
out of the ghetto area after we got 
rounded up was  to go to work  and c ome bac k .  That's  the only  plac e.  You're not allowed to 

stop nowhere else.  And that's what we did for a lit tle while. 

Then they found out s ome more J ewis h people live in t his  area in the c it y, then they  barbed 

wired us around, they found from t he c it y  polic e where t hey lived.  They went with little 

pic k up truc k s  and got them out of t here and I don't know how many they brought bac k  but 

two married sisters who were not with us, they brou
ght bac k  t hem with t heir hus bands  and 

c hildren and other J ewish people in there.   I don't k now how muc h time they gave t hem.  

They were s c reaming, going to knoc k  the door down with a rifle.  Not really knoc k ing lightly,  

ex c use me, I want t o open the door. 
 
Jus t bang the door.  Almos t break  the door down.  

Sc reaming raus!  Raus!  Raus!  Chaos .  You grab what you can on t he pick up truck  and they 

brought  them in to t he three
-
bloc k  perimet er where we were.  All the J ewish people from that 
city was in this three- block perimeter.  I think we were like 5,000 of us in that  area. 
And then we s tayed in this  ghetto area for two years  we s tayed in there.  Not only my family 

had jobs  in the fac tories  but other people heard the s ame news from out of town, t o get jobs  

and
 -- the government, so to speak.  So some people would make bricks, tiles, munitions, I 
was  work ing in munit ions .  My  three s is ters  were in munitions .  They taught me how to mak e

springs in that  factory, metal.  We had a lot of industry.  Small town wit h a lot  of industry. 
W arren Marc us:  So Henry
 --  
Henry Greenbaum:  That s aved us .
 
W arren Marcus:  Excuse me.  Now you're 13, 14.  Your father's foresight, not really knowing 

what would happen but hearing rumors  he knew it would be helpful if y ou could have s om
e 
s ort of job.  Tell us  what life was  like in t he ghett o and how y ou felt about, y ou know, how 

many people y ou liv ed with and what you might have been worried about.
 
Henry Greenbaum:  W ell, it was  hard for t he ghetto after a while.  The only good t hing about 

the ghetto is t he whole family was intact.  We all were together still.  But we lasted t here for 

two years .  We all got filthy dirt y, ran out of soap, ran out of f ood, and we had to depend on 

the Naz i Germans  t o bring us  in ev eryday  food into the ghetto
 
area.  And it would get les s  
and less  and les s.  We have no way to go get ot her food from the other s ide from the people 

that were c oming from their homes  and t he fac tory .  They c ould have brought s omething 

wit h them.  If they were scared, I don't know t h
e answer to that.   But they wouldn't get any 

help.  We stayed there for almost t wo years.  All filthy dirty, really running out of soap.  

Luc k ily we had one cold water pump in the area and we had enough water to drink  at leas t.   

But wintertime,  you could n
ot wash at all.  You became very dirty, full of  lice all of a sudden.  

And then we s tayed almos t lik e two years and then the order came one day , Oc tober 27, I 

remember that  vividly that day, October 27, 1942, two years  into the ghetto,  c ouldn't go to 

work three shif ts, the night shift came back from work, they kept us all in the ghetto area.  

Nowhere els e, nobody  at the fac t ories  anymore and then they ordered us  all out of the 

ghetto area t o a little bigger open f ield and that's  where the s elec tion s tarted.
  
W arren Marcus:  How did the selection work? 

Henry Greenbaum:  They were s itting there at a table and someone was  s tanding up with a

dog wit h guns.  You walk up with a family.  I'll give you the scenario wit h my family.  I walked 
up with my mom, my five s
is ters , three niec es , t wo nephews  and we walk ed up.  Mom to one 

side, the t wo married sisters with their little kids over to the same side as Mom was, the 

grandmother.  Then they s tart ed filling in handic ap people, pregnant women, women who 

just gave child 
birth, and that was  the selec tion.  They pic k ed out whoever cannot do any 

work.  You busy wit h children.  Now, if the women want to give up the children and go with 

grandma, they  were s trong women, we could go to the other side, they'll s end them to the 

other side.  But there was no mothers going to leave children, as far as I knew. 

W arren Marc us:  Did you hav e any  idea what this  meant?  Did you hav e any  idea why  they 

were doing this? 

Henry Greenbaum:  No, not at all.  The only  thing I thought is  they were
 
tak ing all thes e 

people, they're going to tak e them t o anot her area of camp and
 -- 
becaus e t hey're not going 
to be able to work .  So they're going to k eep them there alive.  W e didn't k now what they 

were doing to them.  But after that,  after the selection, t hey put them on trains and st uff like 

animals  and they t ook  them away.  We no longer s aw them.  Af ter the war I found out where 

they took  them.  Treblink a was  the place that they  took them.  And that was  nothing but a 

killing center.  There was no working in that place, in Treblinka.  So the trains were rolling 24 

hours  a day and lie t o them, tak e a s hower.  You never c ome out of t he s hower alive 

bec ause ins t ead of water you come down wit h gas and gas  k ills  you and that's  how my  mom 

and my t wo married s is ters  and niec es  and nephews  and other people that they pulled over 

to the other s ide, that 's  how they  murdered them.  That was  going on from months  after the 

war almos t we found out where they took  them, Treblinka.  They  turn around to us , they 

c has ed us  
s ix k ilometers  uphill.  We c ame by the ghett o area, we thought we're going to go 
bac k  in t o the ghet to area.  We'll have more room, maybe more food, a little cleaner, we

won't be on top of eac h other, but they had other ideas for us of c ours e.   They c hased
 
us  
pas t the ghetto area.   And there was  a big s urpris e s ix k ilometers  away uphill on the top they  
built for us  a slave labor c amp with s ix foot fenc es, barbed wire, towers  and the dogs .  And 

onc e we got up there, chas ing us , lik e I said, huffing and puff i
ng, for me a youngster, I could 
really run.  I was  playing s occer all t he time.  But some other people, they're huffing and 

puffing.  Six k ilometers  to c has e you.  Onc e they got there the louds peak er c ame on, 

attention, att ention, you must empt y all your p
oc kets , all jewelry, money .  You take through 
this gate other than your clot hes or yourself, otherwise you will be killed.  People didn't bribe 

their way  to the s oldiers  in the ghetto, that  day they  had to put it in the big box, giv e up 

ev erything.  You c ould only have y our c lothes  on and y ourself c ome through the gate and 

then on the other side of the gate they were directing traffic to t he barracks.  First time I saw 

a bare rac k , it's  a wooden shac k .  That's  all it was.  B y t he time I got in there, there 
was 

s ome people already  in there and they put us  three people to a bunk , 75 inc hes  wide, three 

people to a bunk .  You wood, no mattress , jus t a s helf.  They  gave us a s mall pillow
 --  
a 
small blanket rolled up.  We used it with a pillow. 

W arren Marc us:  Were you with any one that you k new?  And t here were also women in this  

camp, right? 

Henry Greenbaum:  Yes , but
 --  
W arren Marc us:  Who were y ou wit h.
 
Henry Greenbaum:  My  neighbors .  I was the only  one with my neighbors .  We were very

factories in the little pickup trucks we went  to the factories.  At the factories you came to the 
guardhous e and they  always  s tart, always beating you,  us e the long whips .  We had IDs , we 

went bac k  to the s ame place.  But the new people that they  s aved didn't k now where we 

were going.  Why are you beating them?  Why are you c aus ing
 -- they're asking where they 

go.  They're s uppos ed to follow us  going into that  area.  And there was  a manager t here, 

assign you to work, the one that is didn't have job.  Went like t his almost a year, in the 

munitions fact ory. 

W arren Marc us:  How muc h f ood did you have?  Did t hey giv e y ou any  food in the morning 

or lunc h?
 

Henry Greenbaum:  The food menu was  not
 that  big, believe me.  It was one slice of bread, 
a little blac k  imitation c offee and y ou had t o work  f or ten hours.  You c ame bac k  to the 

barrac k s at night in the evening or whatever your s hift was , cabbage s oup.  They  gav e us  a 

bowl to k eep the soup in with a s poon.  There was  not hing to s poon out of there.  W hy they 

bother even t o giv e y ou a s poon, I  don't unders tand it.  We were drinking it up.  It was  

c abbage water, that would have been t he proper name for that ins tead of c abbage s oup.  

That was  our m enu.
 
W arren Marc us:  The people in the c amp, in addition to being work ed so hard were probably 

s uffering from dis ease and probably s tarv ation too.
 
Henry Greenbaum:  W ell, we did get into a lot of t rouble, not  being in there I would s ay 

wit hin about six or eight months  in the s lave labor c amp, what happened we became very 

dirty, filthy because we still are wearing t he same clothes as when you left the home.  The 

s ame c lothes .  The same underwear.  The s ame s oc k s .   Soc ks  and underway.  The only 

way  you could 
wash them is in the summertime with the cold water.  They didn't give us any 
s oap.

Any way, to make a long s tory s hort, what happened is we all bec ame v ery dirt y and full of 
lice.  We all got lice-
infes ted.  Es pec ially  during t he winter months  bec aus e we could not 

was h yours elf.   A man c an undress  from t he wais t on up and then you don't have soap.  You 

us e dirt from t he ground.  Put it like a mud bath all over yourself.  And the next pers on would 

pump the wat er clean yourself off.  But t hat doesn't kill the 
lic e in your hair.  They wouldn't 

c ut no one's  hair.  The reas on, I don't k now.  The men and the women had long hair.  Very 

long.  For three years you had bushy hair.  Full of lice.  And the lice inf estation, typhoid 

epidemic  broke out  in that camp.  I t was  going through very  fas t bec aus e of  the t ype of 

sickness, it is very contagious.  You sleep with such close quart ers.  If one catches,  t he 

other t wo catch it.  The only difference was high fever,  middle fever, low fever.  If you had 

high fev er, you had no
 
c hoice.  A middle fever, you c ould go to work  may be or not.  But the 
low fever, you were able to go to work.  You have a little slight fever.  I had t he low fever.  

My  oldes t s is ter had low fever.  The t wo middle ones , the youngest of the girls  and the 

mi
ddle girl, all of them died of t yphoid during the night.   She was there, and the other one, 

they had what they  call Einsatz gruppen the k illing unit came t o the c amp every  day .  Before 

you line up how many people c ome to the barrac ks, they  k new how many peo
ple the 

barracks holds and if they saw somebody was missing, they went inside.  Inside they found 

s ome men on the bunk s , they  c ouldn't get off the bunk .   At the beginning they would s hoot 

them right on the bunk .  But then that caus ed a lot of mes s  bec aus e they needed a lot of 

c lean
-up.  So they eventually went and sent these little pickup trucks and they wait ed.  They 

waited until they c ount and then went inside and got thos e people s omehow out and they put 

them on the little pickup trucks.  They took them away to the outskirts of the town which we 

had to dig those trenc hes  before we run into the ghetto.  They  told us  the wharves  s till going 

on and that we

they need t renches  for t he (inaudible) to fall in.  Zigz ag, s ix feet by or four

they were doing.  The people that c ame down wit h the ty phoid, they took  them in t heir 

pic k up truc k , in the open field dress ed nak ed a bullet in the bac k  of the head, ins ide they 

went into t

and went to t he ot her one.  There was  quit e a few people that got s ic k .  My  s is t er, the 

younges t, s he died of ty phoid.  I used to chec k  on her every morning when I  had my night 

s hift.  You're allowed to go in.  She was  in the barrac k s  by herself.  Suppos ed to be a 

hospital.  She was there by herself.   On a wooden shelf .  No mattress, no straw, not hing.  

Laying t here on the top there on the blanket that they gave y ou rolled up.  We us ed it as  a 

pillow because you sleep in your clothes anyway.   All you do is take your shoes off , that's all.  

But I c hec k ed on her one morning,  s he was  c omplaining.  And I bring her s ome rags  in, 

s ome c lothes  from somewhere s o s he can put on top o f the wooden s helf.  So she c ould lay  

on s omething s oft.  Bec ause s he had a lot  of bedsores from being this that litt le barrac k s  by 

herself.  So I -- 
it took  me about three day s  or three night s hifts and I came in the morning, I  

was taking rags that we wip

The middle one, I came bac k from t he night s hift one day, Harriet was  her name, I came 
back from the night shift -- 
we don't have a pic ture of her
 -- 
they let them go t o work, then 
they let the night shif t in.  All of a sudden I  s ee her in the pic kup truc k .  She could not line up 

for work .  She had the typhoid epidemic .  She has  the high f ev er.  I yell to her, Harriet, 

Harriet, (inaudible) 
in J ewis h.  She answered me, we both waved at eac h ot her.  That's  the 

last I saw her.  And I didn't know where they took them.  I thought they took them for 

replac ing them to another c amp or maybe s ome t reatments  t o get s omewhere.  I didn't k now 

they s hoot
 them.  I didn't know that.  I knew my sist er -- 
I didn't s ee her die, but they told me 
s he died.  So that was  t wo.  I had t he older one left with me, she was  like my mom to me.  

She was  treating me really nice, helping me s ometimes  with food.  She wouldn'
t eat it, she 
would give it to me sometimes.  She became a seamstress, working on the German 

uniforms for the high-ranking German officers. 

W arren Marc us:  Henry, how long were you then in the c amp doing t his  work ?
 
Henry Greenbaum:  One year, one year.  Tw

was  the end of it.  They're probably going to k ill all of us  now.  They don't need us  any more
 
bec ause we helped t hem along with the war mac hinery.  Why would they go and leav e us  in 
that area.  I don't know the answer was.  But anyway, these tailors didn't like what t hey 

heard.  They c ame bac k  and they organized an es c ape.  Not the whole c amp, imp
ossible.  
How many they  c ould trus t?  I don't k now how many people they  were in the es c ape group, I 

don't k now.  But  my s is ter was  involved in that one.  She told me the night before the 

es c ape,  whenever you c ome bac k from the fac tory at 11:00, if  I was  work ing from 3:00 in the 

afternoon to 11:00 at night, when y ou come back to the
 -- from the factory do not go inside 
the barracks, wait for me outside.  So I obey that, what ever she says.  It's going to be dark,  

pitch dark.  I don't know how she knew t hat.  
I don't know the answer.  But she c ame by with 

a J ewish policeman holding her hand.  He befriended her.  She held his  hand.  S he c ame 

by .  I was  waiting out s ide, wav ed my  hand, all three were running.  And people were already 

getting out before
 
--
 
es c aped out of there before we did.  Somebody cut a hole t hrough.  It 
was dark, somebody got out .  All of a sudden it was time for me, my sist er and the 

polic eman.  We c ame ten feet away from the es cape plac e, f rom the fenc e.  The lights  c ame 

on.  All of a sudden t he lights  c ame on.  The dog s tarted to bark ing and growing and bark ing 

and he s tarted s hooting at the hole over there, whoever made it  into the hole that t hey 

opened up was  shot either wounded or k illed.  We were only t en feet away all of a sudden 

the three of us  running and I s aid

I was 15 years  old already  at that time.  I was  looking

and they  s tart ed s hooting again.  Anything that moved.  All of a s udden a bullet s truc k  me in 

the back  of the head and k noc ked me out.   From the impac t I was  k nock ed out.  I wok e up a 

few seconds later, started screaming for my sister Faige, Faige in English, and I could not

hear her.  The end of the war,  this  is  the end, I don't have her, I  don't hav e my whole family 
wit h me.  E verybody is gone.  I'm by myself, 15 years old, as far as I knew nobody is alive.  

It was happening at that time, I took  my head up, I c annot run outs ide bec aus e he s urely will 

kill me.  This time I was lucky.   The bullet only grazed me and knocked he down.  It  cuts your 

skin open like a knife, three-inch gash in the back of my head.  As I came back I start feeli
ng 

my  head.  Do I hav e any hairs  in there, I didn't have any hole.  I jus t had a c ut.  Bleeding, a 

few day s  later of c ours e.  I c annot get out.  So I lowered my head down and as  she was  

s hooting and then I was  running towards the woman's  barrack s .  I s aid may be s he c hanged 

her mind.  She ran bac k  into the woman's barrac ks  becaus e not all of the people knew about 

the es cape.  Plenty  of people in the barrack s.  I c ame there, opened the door up.  The 

woman almost attacked me.  You can't come in here, this is for women.   I know it's f or 

women, I can see it's for women.  But I'm looking for my sister Faige.  She's not here, get out 

of here.   She s tarts  pus hing me out of here.  In the meantime they're s hooting.  She can 

hear the s hooting go on.  She did not let me
 in.  I sat in the doorway, I was 15 years old, 
evidently  stronger than s he was.  I  s at there in the doorway and I didn't want to mov e.
 
All of a sudden three, four bullets came in from the tower they were shooting into the bunks, 

into the barracks.  A ll 
the women
 -- 
four shots  c ame in and all of the women jumped off of 
the bunk , on the ground they  want.  Ey e lev el wit h me.  I c ould s ee ev erybody and I was s till 

yelling f or my sis ter Faige.  I c ould not see her.  The more I yelled, yelled Faige.  My firs t 

c ous in entered.  She was  not  aware of the es c ape at all.  She s aid what happened to you 

and your sister is not here.  Trust me, she's not here.  I said okay.  I'm alone at  15 years old.  

She says let me help you.  S he took some water that they have in the barracks bucket there, 

wit h wat er, s he took a rag and s tart c leaning me off a litt le bit.   She had a dry  rag aft er that.  

She put  it on the back  of my wound.  Wear my beret.  She gav e me a beret.  I put it around

my  head and the rag was  abs orbing the blood
.  I still got to leave the place.  I can't stay in 
the women's barracks.  If they catch me t here, for surely they are going to kill me because I 
have a wound on t he head already , tried t o es c ape.
 
So I wait ed until almos t daylight and I didn't
 -- 
until t he
 
s hooting s ubs ided and were not 
s hooting any more.  It  was  quiet, the lights were on, the lights  were roving around, the 

floodlights  bac k  and forth, all around.  And then I was trying whic h way dos es  the searc h 

light go away from the hole.  Not from the hol
e, from where the men's barracks was.  I was 
watc h to go see which way the flood light was  going.  I tes ted it  and s ee how long it tak es  

them to get back.  I said I can make it to my barracks by the time he comes around with the 

s earc h light, flood light I'll be in the barrack s .  And I did t hat.  I lowered my head down as  the 

lights were Goings away from me I made it into the men's barracks.  I said thank God, I'm 

s afe now.  That was not true.  What happened was  an hour lat er roll c all, everybody out.  

The 
night shif t was coming back from the night shift.  They were not involved in the escape.  

They hav e them between the two s ets  of wires .  A nd then they  had us  outs ide c ounting.  

W hy they were c ount ing s till people were rolling out past the hall.  Moved, s om
eone was  
k illed.  They s till were s hooting from the t ower down there.  And the other guys  were down 

below.  And then all of a s udden while we were gathering he told us  to turn in a dif ferent 

direc tion.  We had our heads  in different direc tion and then we see the polic eman who my 

s is ter and I was running with, he was  in the upright pos ition on the ground s till wearing his  

c ap and moaning and groaning.  A lot of wounded people nex t to him on the outside of the 

fenc e.  But you could s ee it was  barbed wire, not
 
electric, so you could still see who was 
there.  And right in the front of us, he took out his  pis tol and he k illed all of the wounded 

people.   The first one was the policeman.  Right next to him was my sist er Faige stretched 

out on t he ground next t o him.  Wherever he was  s itting down I c ouldn't see him until he s hot

devas tated.  Now I hav e nobody, not ev en my s is ter Faige anymore.  I'll be by myself, 15 

years  old.  And then there's

went bac k  t o normal, c losed up the hole again.  We went back  
to our work , regular shifts  that you had, and all of a s udden didn't tak e them a c ouple of 

weeks , three week s when the guy  s ays  we're all going to be deported by suc h and s uc h
 
date, and the date was  there.  And they  didn't let no one go to work  and they lined up the 

freight cars  by  the camp, not too far away ,  and they pac k ed us  in lik e sardines  onto the 

trains we went . 
 

W arren Marc us:  Did they tell y ou where you were going or y ou had no c lue.
 
Henry Greenbaum:  No, we had no
 -- 
we had no idea where they  were tak ing us  or why  they  
were taking us .  No wharves given to us  at all that morning.  We didn't even get our ration of 

the bread on that morning.  They lined us  up and every body was  pac ked in lik e sardines  on 

thos e freight c ars .  And then when it was finis hed it took off.  They went for three days  we 

traveled.  We didn't k now where we were going.  Every s tation that we s topped we
 
--
 
that 
transport was not priority transport.   They let civilian drive through the passenger cars first.  

But thes e c ars  had t o s top and let the other trains  go.  It  took  three day s .  We were y elling 

and s c reaming in unis on every s top we made, water, water!  In different languages .  I k now 

they heard us
 
but t he doors  never opened up and nev er gav e us any water at all.  Finally our

And then as we were coming off the train I  get another selection started.  Again, left, right,

Henry Greenbaum:  I  end up on t he good s ide.  Luc k  was  with me.  The firs t st op was  a

they does n't take but s o long to do.  Very  fas ts  and it was  lik e ex perts  t o do that.  W ith the

s tanding up on the chair and they  give y ou a hairc ut by  head clippers.  It takes  a lit tle while.  

The guy  that gave me the haircut ques tioned the wound on my head, the t hree

the back  of my  head.   He s aid what  happened?  He was talk ing to me 
in Jewish -- 
Yiddis h.  I  
wasn't afraid of him.  I said I was trying to escape with my sist er and a policeman.  Those 

two were k illed and I was  wounded.  There was  a line waiting, he c ouldn't c onferenc e with 

me too long bec aus e they were watc hing him.  And 
it was more than just him.  About three 

to five people with clippers.  The final stop after the haircut, leading into a maze.  You finally 

made it into a s hower room.  Mind y ou you didn't have a s hower in four years

little wagon us ed to happen put the bodies onto little wagon, they  would tak e them f or the

enough, too many that they couldn't c ream mate f as t enough.  That was  our job.  Too long at 

Auschwitz-Bir

produce any work .
 
Luc k  was  with me again.  What happened is  a well

dres sed G erman man c ame in, a very 
nice-
looking guy, two guards  on eac h s ide of him, into our barrac k s  out s ide because they 

were still new.  We just -- 
ac c ording to what they s ay, we were s till in good shape.   They 

were not s k eletons  yet.  He came to our barrack s  outs ide and then who the man ac t ually

as k  what are you tak ing me more?  Are y ou k illing me or

no ques tions .  He's  got guards 

wit h him.  So y ou c ouldn't do nothing.  He took  about 50 of us  out of t he barrack s  and then 

we wound up after that in Buna
- Monowitz after that.  Either by little pickup truck or walk.  I 
think it was five miles away.  I'm not sure. 

W arren Marcus:  That's right. 

Henry Greenbaum:  So I think  may be we walk ed over t here, Buna
-Monowitz, a subcamp of 

Auschwitz.  That man that chose us out of Auschwitz-
Birk enau either ended up being an 

owner or manager of a c hemic al c ompany c alled IG Farben.  They were the producers  of 

cycling 
gas , bug s prays,  automobile tires ,  sy nthetic  fuel, that man was  involv ed in all thes e 
jobs.  He was  interested in my  group to bu ild the road in the compound of the IG f actory with 

the c obbles tones
 
and the s idewalk .  That  was  our job, t he 50 of us , that was  our job to do.  
By that t ime it was already '45.   It was getting on to --

the rail leading into IG.  They knocked out the rail so they couldn't receive any supply, 
c ouldn't ship out any s upplies  and they got s o bad they eventually bombed on the ins ide

k noc ked out t he IG f ac tory altoget her.  So what did they do?  Wait for us  to do?  They 

transfer t o Buna-
Monowitz  and we were going to anot her c amp c alls  Flos s enbürg, near the 
Cz ec h border.  Trav eled day s  and days  to get there bec aus e of  the bombardment. 
 
W e 
ev entually marc hed into the Flos senbürg Conc entration Camp, t wo miles  we had to walk  in.  

It was just a camp like every other camp.   The same food, the same little blanket, the same 

bunk .  Nothing diff erent.  The only  thing different our job, people there before us  had jobs  in 

the BMW fac tory or t he (inaudible) airplane.  They  had t he jobs there before.   But we 

came -- 
only our job was  to bundle up clot hing on people that t hey murdered and bundle up 
c oats , pants  and shipping t hem bac k  into Germany  for recyc ling.  There mus t hav e been a 

heap of  clothes a story high.  Whether it was just from Flossenbürg, that I can't answer.  

Maybe t hey shipped all the clothes from all the camps t here, I'm not sure.  That was our job 

right there.  The food situation, the same little bread, the same little black imitation coffee.  

The s ame soup at night.  That's  all I was  f ed.  We s tayed there in Flossenbürg, it was  getting 

c los e to the end already.  While they were in Floss enbürg we heard some Army was  c oming 

towards us.  
We heard a lot of artillery on the way, heav y  artillery guns  s hooting, banging.  
W e were s tart t o go get happy, somebody's  coming to get us  maybe out of here.  W e didn't 

k now who it was .  We thought it was  Russ ia becaus e we were next to the Czec hos lov ak ian
 
border, six kilometers from the Czech border.  We thought it was the Russians.  But it wasn't 

the Russians.  It was Americans that came to Flossenbürg.  But by the time the Americans 

c ame into Floss enbürg, they emptied out t he c amp all of  a s udden.  They 
put us all on trains 

again.  When the Americ ans  arrived in the c amp nobody  was  t here.  All

we were on trains

train.  And this was already close t o April or close 
to February  rather of '45. 
 
So they  k nock ed out the rail sy s tem altogether and then at the end aft er that they  had no 
alternativ e, how do t hey get us  around?  They took  100 people at a time wit h the two guards  

and the dog and t hey  made marc hs  of groups , marching.  We named it Dead March 

bec ause we were dy ing as we were marching.  With no food at all on t he marc h.  Middle of 

February  to the 25t h of April t hey had no food.  We were eating leaves  off bus hes .  And then 

you were drink ing water out of the c reek .  
 
The only way y ou got a raw potato if the t wo 
guards  were hungry  and the dogs  were hungry, t hey didn't have any supplies  with them 

either.  Maybe they t ook  with them the farm, I don't know.  Went into t he residence of the 

farmer's  hous e and t he order was  he s hould give us  only one raw potato.  You c ould eat ten 

you were so hungry .  Gave only one raw potato and some water to drink , that's  all.  Had to 

wait until the guys  got well fed and the dog, marc h again.  And we k ept  doing that  until the 

24th of April, 
1945.   24th of April, that's the evening we marched into a farm.  All of  a s udden 
they direc ted us  to go into the s ilo where they k eep the hay.   As  we s aid all of a s udden 

they're going to give us  a roof over our head?  April s howers , we were s oak ing wet  lik e rag

t hey're probably going to put the matc h to the hay and burn us all up.  Other people 

no, I don't think they're going to do that.   May be a lot of low flying planes  already, we didn't 

know who the planes were of course.  On the commercial highway we saw that towards the 

ev ening.  The next day  we definitely s aw more.  Why they gav e us  a raw potato to go into 

the s ilo and some water and we s t ayed in there.  We took our clothes off naked and wringed 

our clothes  out, laid t hem down in t he hay s o they  c an dry.  The next morning we're s o

s y s tem.  The morning they wok e us  up, gav e us  another pot at o, never happened before.  
Two potatoes, one the night, one the morning, we k new s omet hing was  wrong.  They  gave 

us  a potato and march f
rom the farm, we march two hours.  Nearby woods, they wouldn't let  
us  go in deep into the woods  from the farm.  We c ould s ee the s ky out.  We c ould see the 

highway from t he distance.  So a lot of artillery pieces, low-
flying planes again and all of a 

s udden we were s itting in a c irc le.  The two guards  we had took  off and disappeared into t hin 

air.  They took the dogs  and dis appeared.  They told us  if we tried to esc ape they were going 

to k ill us .   Nobody mov ed.  We stayed s till.  We thought they were hiding
 
behind t he trees .  
W e didn't k now what they were doing.  But  they were look ing out for thems elv es .  They 

k new this  was  Army, probably  Americ ans, that they'd end up getting caught by the 

Americ ans .  They ran into another farm and c hanged their clothes  and 
like a civilian.  So 

that's what they did. 

W e were sitting by ourself.  We said no guards, somebody's going to kill us f or sure now.  

And as  we were s itting in the edge of the woods , low
-
flying planes again.  And the highway  
we s aw out of  nowhere a tank  ta

And the five f eet away from us, the door, t he hatch opens up of f of the t ank .  All of the 

bus hes  and t rees , I  gues s  we were wearing the s tripes , they could s ee them in binoc ulars.  

But if we could s

Some day.  So thank God for saving my lif e.  But why did it ta

we were liberated.  But we were all s k eletons  already becaus e we didn't eat any bread, no

She went there, located her brother, located my brother in the Dis plac ed Pers ons  Camp in

Henry Greenbaum:  After the war we were mad at the whole world.  Why did
 they let us do 
what they did -- 
the Germans  and Naz is did to us .  We felt lik e we were abandoned.  We 

were marc hing in the c ountry s ide.  Some people s aw us  there.  We ran ac ros s  a group of 

the Hitler equivalent t o Boy Scouts.   They would t hrow rocks at us, dirty this and dirt y that in 

German.   We already knew the c urs e words  already, s o I'm s ure they went home to their 

parents  and told the parents  what they saw.  Saw people skeletons  walk ing.  They didn't 

look  normal.  But yet thes e parents , when you appro
ach them after the war, they said they 
didn't k now any thing about t his  at all.  No German admit to me, I would lik e one of them to 

s ay you k now what ?  I'm s orry they did that to you but I c ouldn't help it.  I would hav e tak en 

that answer good.  But to tell
 
me y ou didn't k now about it, no,  I didn't believe it.  I don't think  
the whole world didn't k now anything.  They  all k ept quiet and we felt lik e they  were 

abandoned and no one look  for us until that beautiful angel s oldier told me I was  free.  I was 

mad a
t t he whole world.  America, Russia, British, I mean, England, they couldn't get the 

three c ountries  together and s end a mes sage to Adolph Hitler, whatev er the hec k  his  name 

is , burn in hell.  So you can't do that  to human beings.  We're going to attac k yo
u.  I gues s  

he wouldn't fight four countries at one time.  I don't think so.  But there was a lot of politics

gues t.
 
Henry Greenbaum:  I'm not good at t he las t word. 
 
W arren Marc us:  Yes, y ou are.
 
He
nry Greenbaum:  All I c an tell y ou is  remember the survivors , remember y ou s aw a 

survivor, you spoke t o him or you met him or not just me, other survivors, it's a beautiful 

museum here.   I hope that you will remember that.  Don't discriminate against anybo
dy.  
Treat ev erybody the s ame as you t reat
 -- want to be treated yourself.  Feel better, at least by 
our lifetime I t hought that people will stop killing one another,  but event ually it looks like it's 

not happening s o far.  Still people killing each other.
  And somehow, someway maybe if I'm 
gone, maybe tak e another 10, 20 y ears , who k nows , may be some people will quiet down 

and treat one anot her the way they  want t reated t hemselves .  But do remember the 

s urvivors and t he 6 million innocent and the 1
 1/ 2 mill
ion c hildren who were murdered for no 

other reas on than just being Jewish.
