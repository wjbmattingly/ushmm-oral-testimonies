discharged. They had to come back, you know, because the war broke out right after
that. AndI wentto from Camp Grant I went to, I guess it was Texas Brownwood,
Texas and Camp Campbell, Kentucky and Indio, CaliforniA: I spend a whole year out
there. They were preparing us to go to Africa and we got sent to Germany. After that we
because we were built at Indio, California, the desert training center, there was nothing
there when we got there. After that we went to New York and we departed for Europe
and we landed in Marlborough. We were on the Queen Mary. We had 23,000 people on
that ship. We slept in shifts, more or less. And it took us a long time, because they were
saying that, be careful, you know, after the big boat, you know, Queen Mary
Q: You mean the subs were after the boat?
A: Yeah. I mean, so we landed in Marlborough, England and we stayed there for a while.
They had the invasion and I think we went about three weeks, or two weeks after the
invasion, because they had to make room for us to land because of the fighting there and
stuff. When I got there, you could still see ships, their nose up, I mean. We had to stay
on the landing barges for a day or two before we went to shore, you know.
Q: Yes. Let's back up for just a little bit. How did you feel about being drafted?
A: Well, I didn't I didn't feel so good. Because at that time we had soldiers and dogs
weren't allowed in the taverns and (inaudible) they didn't allow us there, so, but, like I
say, I was one of the first draftees to go. Ijust JIalmost had I didn't care about it,
because I had eight months in and who wanted, you know, the army? If all of them wants
to go and then the war broke out and I had to get go and, you know, and then we didn't

now how long the war was going to last, whether it was going to last a year, two years,
five years, ten years or a hundred year war or whatever it is. But, that's the way it was.
Q: What did you train as, sir? What were you an infantryman? an armorman?
A: No, I was a medic. But we had basic training, because, you know, everybody had to
take basic training.
Q: How did you feel about being a medic?
A: Well
Q: Did you select it or were you assigned?
A: No, I was assigned as a medic, because they were asking people to drive for
(inaudible) and stuff like that. But, I took the medics, because I thought it was safer than
being in the gutter or somewhere in there.
Q: Uh huh.
A: So, that's what it was.
Q: Do you feel that your training adequately trained you for combat?
A: Oh, yeah. We had to have combat training and then — especially in the desert with the
tanks, maneuvers and stuff. We had good training over there in the desert. The heat was
125 out there. We actually, sometimes didn't do anything, but to get used to the weather,
you know. But, I had a suntan. I wore shorts all the time and you could see the white
here and all black here.

almost.
Q: What did you do when you were in England? Were you still training?
A: Training, yeah. We were waiting for the invasion, you know, because they would
send out ships (inaudible) and they were testing out the Germans there, you know,
because they had all the coastline all pretty well fortified and we landed in England, they
had we had gas masks, because England was all set for if they would get poisoned gas
and stuff and in case the Russians the Germans, but they were fighting two fronts, in

some come. You have to be well prepared for that. Our general got the stars from every

Q: Did you like General Walker? Did you respect him?
A: Oh, yes, he was a good general. But Patton was kind of rough. I mean, he was_ |
was kind of scared of him. Every time I knew he was coming I'd stay away from
headquarters there.
Q: Sure.
A: So, I didn't want to get a slap in the face (laughing). No, but that's his job. So, I
mean, he had to do it, him with his 45's. But cause some generals they Patton wanted
a credit, Eisenhower wanted a credit, MacArthur wanted a credit, Bradley wanted a
credit, and Churchill wanted I mean, they all wanted to outdo one another, but, I guess

Q: Okay. What can you tell me about that?
A: Well, they build them platoons and we crossed.
Q: Did you engage the Germans there? Did you engage the enemy during the crossing
the Rhine?
A: We didn't, the people in front of us did. I mean, there were tanks and infantry. There
were troops in front of us. We took care of the troops that, you know, invaded them.
Cause we had our own little G1, G2, G3, G4, we had to care of officers and enlisted men,
to give them shots and whatever they needed. But, we didn't go right up to the front
because we had _ Patton had his men up there. All he wanted was tanks, tanks, tanks, the
hell with the infantry. You see tanks all along the road there, and that was it.
Q: Did when you were actually in Europe
A: Yeah?
Q: did you and after having served in combat did your attitudes about the war change at
all?
A: Well, sure it changed. I mean, it's gladit was over. Imean, we be theysent I
had 92 points, I mean, it was enough to get a cross, but they sent the people, the soldiers
in front of me, that were rookies and stuff, and they just come after me and stuff, they
didn't have enough points, they send them back to USA to train them to go back to not
train them, but to revitalize them to go back to Pacific, you know. So, we had_ Iwas

to get home, the heck with that. So, they left me there anyway. And there 1s no revelling,
no retreat, no nothing. But we went horseback riding and then we could play golf, and
nobody to, you know, bother you or stuff. But then later on, we got through in Japan,
they dropped the atomic bomb there, so
Q: As you were moving through Europe and advancing with the Third Army, do you
recall coming across any concentration camps?
A: Oh, I didn't come across but there were a lot of them there. They told us. They had us
scattered all around.
Q: Did you see any of them?
A: Well, Buchenwald. That's the only one that I really seen there, you know.
Q: Tell me about experiencing Buchenwald. When did you arrive there? What did you
see? What did you think was going on?
A: Well, I rode with the captain. He was a medical officer, he got discharged (inaudible)
colonel later on, but, I had to with go with him, and he and I went in a jeep, and seen the
camp. And we seen how the soldiers they hada flagpole they tried to get out,
because they knew we were coming and the Germans shot them and left. They were
right by the flagpole there and stuff. But so and then the only way we could see them
is they wouldn't allow us to feed them or anything like that, they were fed
intravenously, the ones that were ready to die anyway, I mean, but we got in cause we
had medical I had a van and, you know, I was with the captain, so, he was a medical

officer. So, they let us in and we went in the camp there, and it stunk and the tears and
the urine and all that stuff. I couldn't stand it. I went through one barracks there, that
they had there, and the trains were just lined there and they were peeing and stuff and it
was just I couldn't stand it, so, I just left after that.
Q: Did you speak to any of the prisoners?
A: No, I didn't speak to them.
Q: Did you provide any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?
A: Not we. But they took care of them, I mean, they emptied the soldiers they try to
get, you know, them out of the way first, because they were dead, but the ones that were
still in there, they took them I don't know where they took them, the hospitals or
something, and tried to reyuvenate them, you know, because they were all skin and bones,
I don't think they'd live anyway, but you try it and stuff, they were so glad to see to us.
Because they had a table like this, they had lampshades made out of skin, you know, they
took the skin and made lampshades out of them or anything they could use. And, of
course, they had hair, I seen it, they stripped them with they got shoes and stuff up
there, and that was it.
Q: Did any of the prisoners try to speak to you, or say anything to you?
A: No. They just wanted to something to eat, you know, and stuff. They couldn't speak,
I mean, they're laying there like four or five of them in a little space. It was terrible.
Q: How long were you inside the camp itself?

Interview with John Truty 12
A: In the concentration camp?
Q: Yes.
A: Not too long. I couldn't stand it. It stink and smudge and stuff. I don't know how
they could survive.
Q: Did you see any enemy inside the camp, living or dead?
A: No. But later on, I did see enemy soldiers after they surrendered. They put their guns
in a big pile and they'd hand these prisoners to the Frenchmen, you know, and the French
took over and especially SSS guys. They hated the Frenchmen hated SS they were
supposed to be the elite of the army there. So, they take them and march them in the
forests and you could hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, they got aim with them.
Q: Uh huh.
A: Some of them that like I say, mostly SS guys that they didn't, they hated and stuff
but
Q: Now, was that the French unit that was marching with 20 corps?
A: Yeah. I don't know how they got attached to them, I mean, but they let them have
the French the German prisoners, so
Q: Did you see the crematoria at Buchenwald?
A: Yeah.
Q: You did? Can you describe what you saw going in to that area?

http://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with John Truty 13
A: Well, seeing these bodies right there, packed like 2 by 4s, you could see they're all
skin and bones. And inthe back the crematoria, there was all ashes that they emptied
out. Because they had two like two small freight cars and they put them in and they
take them out. I didn't see that seen them doing it, but I seen the ovens there, you
know. I tried to take a picture, but it didn't come out. It blurred and stuff, all black. But
you could still make out a little bit that it was the freight cars, them little freighters.
Q: After seeing Buchenwald, after seeing the concentration camp, did it change your
attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?
A: Yeah. Then I realized that we had to do it, I mean, after all, otherwise it will kill
everybody. Especially the Polish people, because there's a lot of Jews in Poland there
and stuff, and they first took the Jews and then probably the next, Polish and I still got
cousins and aunts and _ living there.
Q: Living in Poland?
A: Yeah. In fact, I went to see them in 1982 with my sister, because my wife didn't want
to go, so I took my sister there and we spent two or three weeks there.
Q: After you left the camp, did you meet any of the surrounding population who lived
around the camp.
A: Not really, no. There wasn't too many left there. It's just a woman that was women
and kids maybe, that's all, but the guys were in the army and stuff and there's healthy

guys and stuff. But, I didn't meet any of the older folks, because there was none left, I
mean, they were starving too.
Q: How long were in the area around Buchenwald?
A: I don't know. Maybe a couple of days, and we went on.
Q: You pushed into Austria after this?
A: Yeah. We wound up in Austria with the Russians there.
Q: Do youremember did you meet up with the Russians?
A: No. I didn't talk to them, but the guys in front of us did, you know, we stopped there
and we come back.
Q: How did you learn about V E Day?
A: How did I learn? Well, it was in the papers and stuff. We were glad it was over. But,
I know there is another war going on with Japan. We weren't through yet, but, that was a
piece of cake, I mean, as far as after they put the atomic bomb and stuff.
Q: How long were you in Europe after V E Day? How long did you stay after?
A: Oh, I stayed until the war was over in Japan, and then they shipped me back. They
must have sent some Army of Occupation or something, earlier on, to take care of that.
So, like I say, we had it made_ it was a piece acake. We were playing golf we
couldn't play golf because we didn't have no golf balls. But, I wanted to come home
regardless, I mean, they could give me a million buck, of course, I wasn't too long

army, it was $21 a month. By the time you get your cleaning done and stuff, we had to
wear civilian clothes and get that cleaned and, of course, we got rations (inaudible) all
that free, you know. But, still in all, you go out and have a couple of beers or something
and of course, beer was cheap, but you didn't I was always broke. Getting the crap

citizenship. But, I stopped I took a train, and I stopped in the tavern I used to go to,
because it was like a block and a half away, instead of going straight home, I stopped in
the tavern, had some couple of beers, and they were all glad to see me there, seen some
friends, and before you knew it, halfa crowd andthenI went home. They were glad to
see me, and my mother had two stars in the windows, you know, she was so proud of me.
But, that was it.

A: It was great. I mean, I was overjoyed, cause like I say, I didn't know how long I was
going to be in the service, in the army, because, you know, you are a long ways from
home and, of course, we went back on a boat, on a small boat, but we didn't come back
on a Queen Mary like because, I don't know why. Well, anyway I was sure glad to get
home.
Q: What did you do after the war?
A: After the war I got a job. I didn't work too long, about a year and a half, and then I got
into business. My buddy's father had a restaurant. He was in partnership with a guy in
Chicago close to the Loop, and they had an argument there, so he said you buy me out or
I buy you out. So, he didn't have too much money, so he asked me if I would like to get

into business, and I didn't have any money, my dad didn't have any money, so my dad
had to borrow money, he trusted me. I don't know why my partner in the restaurant
business, he kind of figured I was you know, I could save a buck, I wasn't too _ so, he
said, you'll get that back in no time. I took his word for it, and I told my dad, I says, if
you can borrow some money, and my dad had some good friends and he borrowed 6,000
bucks, I think it was, and he I got in partnership with him. It worked out in no time. I
paid my dad out first, and then I was sitting pretty. I bought a car, and I had a pretty good
life after that, I mean, hey, while the sun was shining, because, you know, they had to go
to Wisconsin to buy to slaughter. You have to get some everything was rationed
not yet but, before that. And so they used to go get meat there and stuff, and I was in
the restaurant business for 27 years. So, it was a cafeteria style though. But, it's not like
what it is now. Now you need a cashier or a manager or a this or that or anything for
you. We did have about 12, 13 employees, but we were opened up from 5:30 in the
morning until 2, 3:00 the next morning, you know. But, then they start dwindling down,
the neighborhood started changing. Eventually we only had breakfast and dinners,
because we used to get the crowds after bowling and stuff. They didn't they cut that
out, I mean, they were afraid to deliver, the neighborhood was changing, shooting and
stuff. I got up here. So, [had to give it gave it up.

of his ship. He was anxious to get back there to kill them Japs and stuff. So, I didn't tell
my mother and dad_ because my dad died when he was young, 65. And, I was my
mother lived to be 100 one month short of being 100. So, she was a widower for a long
time, but she was in a nursing home. And don't I mean, after she'd be better off dead
than living the way she lived in a wheelchair all the time. We had a nursing home close
to home in Chicago, and my sister always used to go see her every day, feeding her, and
fixing her hair and stuff like that. But, that was it, I mean.
Q: Did you have the opportunity to see the exhibition upstairs in the museum?
A: First time, today, I went.
Q: What did you think’?
A: Nice, gorgeous, amazing. They should show _ if the people seen it real, you see it
yourself, it's different than telling people, you know. But, now they see you can see the
pictures and stuff, that's really wonderful.
Q: Do you think it accurately did it accurately portray your experience?
A: Yeah, it was pretty close to it, I mean. You see it in the movies and stufftoo in the
papers and stuff, but you can't beet this, 1t was wonderful, really.

Interview with John Truty 19
Q: What would you most like future generations to learn from your experience in the
war?
A: Well, if you want freedom, you got to fight for it, I mean. That's why Obama and
stuff, and maybe these younger generations would straighten them out. And I think we
all hate war, as far as that goes. War is hell for everyone, you know, but that's you
know, we were there. But, it's the best thing to do is try to stay out of it. And (inaudible)
is sticking her nose here and there, and we're fighting for everybody else, and there will
always be war. As long as there are two people living, you and I, we're you want what
you got, plus what I got, and I want what you want. That's the name of the game, I mean,
that's it.
Q: Okay. Well, thank you, sir, and thank you for your service to our nation.
A: Okay.
Q: Okay. Thank very much, indeed. It 1s 15:22 hours.
