Beginning File One
Question: This is January 22", and we’re at the home of Helga Gross for an
interview for the Holocaust Museum. Would you tell us about where you grew up,
what your family was like; your parents, your siblings, your background?
Answer: I grew up at my parents’ home. I was a very happy child, until Hitler
changed everything, and he changed my life. It was very rough.
Q: Did you know about Hitler and his policies? When did you become aware of
Hitler and his — and his policies?
A: He was president of — in Germany, Interbruck(ph). Oh, at the Hindenburg.
When Hindenburg, when he died, Hitler took over. We were all shocked that that
happened. Before, we didn’t know. My grandmother was crying, my mother and
father, what’s going on? We had no idea.
Q: How old were — how old were you at the time?
A: I think it was 1933 when he took over, so I was 13 years old. I remember it well,
when I saw my parents and my grandmother, they were all crying. I didn’t
understand yet, I was still too young, and I was deaf. So, interviews were very
difficult.

January 22, 2003
Q: How did you communicate in your family, because — well, first tell us —I—T?’m
sorry, first tell us about your family, and were they all deaf, or were your parents
deaf, or — tell — give us a little bit more about what your family was like.
A: My parents were hearing. My father was awkward. He really didn’t have good
communication with — with deaf people. My mother, my mother was a singer, and
she really taught me how to speak, and play the piano, and with intonation, using
the piano, and I practiced a lot. And that’s one reason I s — I spoke well, the German
language, that is. Every morning at breakfast, we would sit with paper and pencil,
and I would try and talk to my parents, using a different language, and my parents
thought that I was using a wrong language. They said, you must speak properly. If it
was wrong, then we would write down on the paper, and — on the paper, the correct
way. And they told me I must read a lot of books, and learn the language correctly.
Q: So — so, 1t was your mother who really was the communicator in the family?
A: Yes.
Q: What about with your —
A: They never ignored — my mother never ignored me or my brother. The two of us
were deaf, and she always paid attention to us. I have another brother and sister as
well, and they’re hearing. And they play music. I couldn’t hear anything, but we

were very happy as children. Always music in the house. Music’s in our blood, all
of us.
Q: T-T-Tell — go ahead.
A: When people would come to visit, or to eat, there were — we were always
playing, and they would ask us questions. They would say the alphabet. For five
minutes we would have to write, or I would write, until I got everything right. And
if the names were wrong, I would be like a game, who could remember the names,
and who could spell them right. And I would win. I remember being so happy. We
would go out after dinner for a walk. My father taught me what’s the name of that
tree, and see that bird? Here’s the name of this bird, and always trying to teach me,
my father was. All of the children, actually. He would use gestures, and he would
move his mouth.
Q: How did she understand what he was saying? Did she read lips, or —
A: Yes, I read his lips. My mother could see in my mind, but the German language,
I hadn’t learned it, it was a hard process. [phone ringing]
Q: Can you tell her to stop the telephone ringing? [technical, break] Ask her again,
because the phone — because the phone rang, if she would tell us again about how
she and her father communicated.
A: Again? Start from what I said before, or what — what do you mean again?

Q: Yes, from what — from what — from what she said before about when she would
walk with her father — [phone ringing] We have to unplug the phone. [technical
interruption, break] Okay, so I-I’m trying to understand if — if her family, did they
sign, or did they just read lips, or how did they — how did they communicate?
A: We — lips — we read lips, and signed, too. My parents didn’t have anything
against signing. They thought signing was beautiful. Signing as — helped to relax
with deaf people. It’s hard to just — and stressful to just read lips, so they preferred
us to be relaxed. Some other people’s parents were against signing, and they really
forced them to speech read, and the children got very frustrated, but I was very
relaxed, and very happy, because my mother and father had a lot of music in the
house, and they understood the arts, and there was a lot of love around us always. I
was very lucky to have my — the parents I had.
Q: Tell us — tell us about your school, what — what kind of school you went to.
A: It was a deaf school. Did you read about — deaf and dumb is what it means. A
long time ago, they used to refer to deaf, as deaf and dumb. Deaf stumm, in
German. And I would be silent, I would just say deaf, not dumb. Now, it’s like
handicapped. That’s much better than a long time ago, when they said deaf and
dumb. I would go back and forth, from home to school. It was about a 30 minute
walk. I was very happy with my classmates at school. We played around, we talked.

Signing was not allowed in school, the teachers forced us to speech read. But when
we were outside, we all signed together.
Q: And how long did you go to this school? Was it — did she start school in this
school? Was this from —
A: Until I was 14 years old, I went to that school, maybe I went — my mother took
me to school, I think first to a hard of hearing school, and they found out that my — I
didn’t hear well enough. So then they put me in the school for the deaf. I was nine
years old, eight or nine, at the time. Stayed there until I was 14. Then I stayed home
with my parents. I was like a house-daughter, I cleaned, I cooked. They taught me
how to — to speak, and how to do a lot of things.
Q: Was this —
A: When I was — two year later, when I was 16, this house-daughter learned to cook
and sew and everything, so then I went to work. I went to work as a weaver. I
learned art, I went to school with hearing people, of course. It was really difficult
for me. I was frustrated. I didn’t really understand what the teacher was saying. My
mother talked with the administrators about my problem in being deaf.
Bibliotheque. I went into the library, got books, and it still didn’t satisfy me enough,
I needed to have that one-on-one education. But I had to accept that I was deaf, so
they just went ahead and let me go to work. I think when I was 17 or 18 years old,

the boss where I was doing weaving, he really liked me, I was kind of his pet. He
liked my designs. A very small town, where he lived, the boss invited me to their
house to work. There was one town, then Hamburg, and another town. The bombs
started happening in Hamburg, and destroyed everything. My parents evacuated,
they went south. I stayed in the island. I stayed in the island — on the island. I
begged my boss to contact my parents, but he refused. He just told me to stay put,
and I cried so much. I hoped that my parents were still alive. I didn’t know if they
were dead or alive, there was no contact for a month. And finally, we received word
that my parents were alive. Then my boss allowed me to go and to see my parents.
And I stayed in the south, in Bavaria.
Q: A-Ask her how — how old was she when she — when she left school, and then
how old was she when she left —
A: I was 14 when I left school.
Q: And when did you leave home’?
A: Around 16. Our house was destroyed by fire. My father had many, many books
in the fire, destroyed all of them but one. My brother and I — the three of us, my
deaf brother and I — the other brother and sister were gone. One was in the army,
my other sister was gone, my deaf brother and I, we were with my parents, and we
saw what was left. A lot of people died from the bombings and the fires.

Q: Can we go back? When she was in school, and talked about what happened
when the steriliz — how they were told by their teacher, when the sterilization law
took effect? One moment. [break] So again, my question is when did she fi — how
did she find out about the sterilization law, and how did they talk to her about it in
school?
A: In the class, the teacher came into the room and said, good morning. There were
six boys and four girls, and I was one of the girls. We were all sitting in like a
semicircle. The teacher was standing up by the window. He was looking — we were
just waiting. The teacher didn’t teach anything. We were wondering what was
wrong. Then came a man from the government. It was very interesting, and he said
to all of us, school students — he was explaining to us how to breathe. And you must
go to the hospital for sterilization. And we said what? Why? What do you mean, go
to the hospital for sterilization? He explained that when you grow up and get
married, you won’t be able to have a baby. We said, huh? It means we can’t have a
baby? We all looked at each other. We really didn’t understand. Then he left. I went
home, and I told my mother. My mother really didn’t explain it to me. Later I found
out that my mother had gotten a letter from them. No, wait, forget, just a moment.
They chose an 11 year old girl from my class. She had deaf parents. They took them
all to the hospital at one time, and sterilized them. When they came back — we were

young, we really didn’t understand. Especially, clearly, we didn’t understand what
it all meant. Well, we just thought nothing of it, and continued playing. My father, I
was like his pet, he really loved me. And I felt funny. I told my mother, why is my
father so affectionate and loves me so much, as compared with my other sisters and
brothers? Why, what’s wrong? Mother said, oh your father likes you just like
everybody else. Everybody’s equal. He loves to see you smile, though. He called
me sunshine. Then, as the time became near, I remember very well, I was in the
kitchen, and I was cleaning. My mother came and said, Helga, sit down. And she
explained, you have to go to the hospital in two days. I said, I have to go to the
hospital to get sterilized? I was calm. I kind of accepted it. My mother must have
thought something was wrong, or that I was going to run away, or get crazy, but I
was very calm. She said, how come — later she asked me, how come you were so
calm? And I said, well, the other girls had it done, so I just accepted it, that it was
fair. If they did, I guess it was my turn. My father cried. He refused to see me. He
didn’t want to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital. It was a very small,
cute hospital, very nice place actually. Babies — only babies were born there. A
woman did the surgery. Gave me anesthetic and a shot, that everything was good
and clean. After the surgery, I woke up, I was throwing up, and I could — I could
feel something heavy on my stomach. My mother was sitting next to me, and I

tapped her, she was like sleeping. I said, Mummy, Mummy. The second sister
underneath me, opened the door and looked in and said hi. Her big eyes looked in at
me, and I was laughing. She was so funny, to see her just these two big eyes, poking
through the door. Oh, but the pain when I laughed, oh-ho, great pain. I said go
away. Where was my father? He couldn’t come. He was so embra — embarrassed,
because he was crying for me. Later, two of my schoolmates came, and the three of
us just sat and cried.
Q: Did she know — did she know — well, to go back a little bit, when — how old was
she when that man first came in, and then how old was she when the — the operation
happened to her?
A: I was 11 or 12 years old. The other girl was 11 when she went to the hospital, I
hadn’t gone to the hospital I was — until I was 16. They were hoping that I wouldn’t
have to go, but I wanted to become a grandmother, you see, and that’s the reason —
or, they wanted to become a grandmother if I — I had a child, and that’s the reason
my mother was crying, and my father, too.
Q: Did she un — did you understand why this was happening, why they were doing
this?
A: Not until later. Years later. When I moved to the United States in 1954, five
years later, I went back to Germany for a visit. I saw my baby sister. She had a

beautiful baby. The baby was so beautiful, I got to hold the baby. And that morning,
my sister was feeding the baby, and then I realized what I felt, when I realized I
couldn’t have any children. I started to cry, and I— I ran into the bathroom, and just
cried and cried. When I came back out, my sister said, what’s wrong, what’s the
matter? I said, oh, I’m just crying because I’m happy for you because you have a
beautiful child. Then the next day I saw other people, and I — with babies, and I
cried. And as I got older, I tried to forget about it.
Q: How old was she when this — when this happened, when she took this trip? Was
she married, or was she single, or —
A: I was married then. I was 35 years old, about.
Q: Did — did — did the officials, the government officials, or your family, explain
why this had to happen to you? Why this operation was going to happen?
A: My mother’s brother was a judge, and he was trying to help us, to prevent the
operation. He was not successful. Oh, he was not a member of the Nazi regime, so it
didn’t work. My father was the same way. I was a Girl Scout, and they were trying
to force me to become a member of the Nazi party. I said oh, no. They said, you
must. I said, why? Because you can speak with hearing people, and other — and
children. Well, my mother taught me how to speak. They gave me the paper, told
me I had to go to the flag — where the flag was, and sign some papers. I refused. My

weaving boss invited me to the island to stay, and I went there and I told the
teacher, I’m leaving for the island, they invited me. I don’t know how long I’Il stay.
She said, bring the papers with you. You must go in there with your papers, and
take them with you everywhere. My heart sank. I felt so much fear, for a very long
time. I would sleep, and then I would walk to work. The Nazis, two of them, would
stand there with their flags, as I walked by. I had the papers with me all the time.
Should I go or not, should I go or not? I would pass them. I was afraid they’d pull
me back by my hair, but they didn’t, I’d say no. And every day this would happen,
and I’d be filled with fear as I walked past these two men with their flags. And they
were bombing Hamburg. And I needed a rest, and I thought I needed some relief.
But I heard later that our teacher was dead from the bombs. Then, when I went to
the south, to join with my father and mother, I still had those papers with me. Then,
during the war, then we saw the white flag. Bombs were everywhere. And now I
could claim — come to — from south, I went to — could go to America. Before I
came to America, in Germany, the Americans — the Germans, we lost the war.
Hitler died; that was good. When we saw the white flag, it meant that we had given
up, that there was no more war. The American soldiers saw us, and they tore the
papers, threw them away, threw them in the fireplace, and burned them up. Boy, did
I feel relieved. Then years later, I wanted to come to the USA, my husband’s uncle

helped us, they — to support us for five years. And after five years, I became an
American citizen. Before, in Germany, in Hamburg, my husband and I asked his
aunt and uncle — they lived in Michigan, Detroit, Michigan — we came as an immi
— as immigrants, and they were very happy to help us, to support us. But the aunt
and uncle went to the American consulate, and at the consulate they asked for
papers, and they told them about my husband and I, that we were deaf. They turned
us down. They say deaf was not allowed to come to the United States. I was very
disappointed. Two years later, one American man from Boston — he was deaf
himself, we became good friends. We told him about wanting to come to the States,
and we said we were looking for freedom. And I had read books about America,
and I was so impressed. This man said, good. He helped us go to the American
consulate, and asked for our papers, and he said, I will support them. They turned us
down again. Second time I was disappointed.

Beginning File Two

A: So the — the gentleman went to Washington, D.C. He typed out everything, and
finally they allowed us to come to the United States, thanks to this gentleman from
Boston. We had been waiting for two years on a — on a list. There were many
people. Finally, they called us — well, actually, it was less than two years — they
called us to come to America. The first and second times, there were so many
questions, and there was a — a list. And one of the questions that they asked, had
you been a member of the Nazi party? And I answered, no. And in my mind I
looked back, and I thought, if I had said yes, they wouldn’t let us come to the U.S.,
if I had joined, way back when. This is true. So I’m so happy that that never took
place, that they didn’t force me. So they swore us in. You have to obey the laws in
the United States, and they explained some of the rules, and we said yes, yes, I do,
I do.
Q: Okay, let’s go back, and again I — I need to know how — if they explained why
this operation needed to hap — needed to happen to you deaf children?
A: Because my [interruption]
Q: The question is —
A: They explained to the deaf children that they didn’t want deaf children — that
they had to be sterilized because they didn’t want deaf children to have children

who would grow up and be deaf as well. So this is how they explained it to us. And
my brother was deaf, as well as me. So a long time ago, in the generation, it just
happened to the two of us, we don’t know why. So this other classmate of mine, her
parents were hearing, and she was free from it, because her father was a member of
the Nazi party.
Q: Did you think, because there was so much time that passed, from the time that
they first told you, til you were 16 and they took you for the operation, did you —
did you think all that time that you were still possibly going to get this operation?
A: Well, really, I wasn’t even thinking about it. My mother didn’t explain it to me
enough, and the teacher certainly didn’t explain it to all of us. Once was enough,
that was all, once they told us, and not more than that. So I didn’t really give it
much thought.
Q: Did anyone, either in your family, or in the school, try to stop them from doing
these operations?
A: The school, people from the school, but not my family.
Q: Okay, she has to, again, nobody’s going to know what I asked her.
A: The man that came from the government to our school, told the teacher to choose
which children that we should send to the hospital for sterilization.
Q: Did a — but, did anyone try to stop them from doing it?

A: My uncle, who was a judge, tried to stop it from happening, but he failed.
Q: Okay. After — no, that’s [indecipherable] I’m sorry. After the war, how did the
operation affect your plans to marry?
A: My husband — I felt sorry for my husband. He — he was sterilized too, and he had
gotten the letter. And they sent him to the hospital, and he refused, he rebelled
against it. Then he got a second letter, and he rebelled again. The third time, they
came and took him to the hospital. Without any anesthetic, they just tied his hands
down, and they sterilized him. And he screamed. But he was very strong in his
mind, very wonderful. He was a good sportsman. He was in the Olympic swimmers
—he was an Olympic swimmer. After the operation, no, he went downhill.
Q: Was this —
A: So, he was looking for a woman, and then he found me. And I was a good
swimmer, too. So we had peace of mind, neither of u — neither of us could have
children. So, it — it was a good marriage, in that sense.
Q: How old was her husband when — when they did this to him?
A: I think it was 17 or 18 years old, I think.
Q: He was 17 or 18 years old, what?
A: When they sterilized him. His aunt from Michigan had come to see him. My
husband must have gone to the hospital for sterilization, and my — my — his aunt

said, come with me, come with me. And the — he said no. He was in the headlines
because he was a famous swimmer, like Johnny Weissmuller was in the States.
He kept all of these clippings together, and his aunt did. And his father said to him,
you have to play with girls before you have a baby, before you get sterilized. And
he said no, I don’t want to play with girls.
Q: So —-
A: But it failed. They took him anyway.
Q: So even though he was a famous, admired athlete, that didn’t keep them from
doing this to him?
A: No. I don’t know why, but they didn’t ask him any questions, really. I really
don’t like to think of the past so much, and he didn’t think about it. We now have to
look forward. I feel sorry for so — thousands of people who died. They had it — in
the camps, they had it worse than I did, actually. I’m thankful. I’m very thankful.
I’m still alive. I’m 80 years old. I can climb, I can do lots of things.
Q: I have a question. It sounds like your family life was wonderful.
A: Yes.
Q: So, to your parents, there was nothing wrong with you, but you couldn’t hear —
except you couldn’t hear. And then the government comes — and then the
government comes, and says you’re defective.

January 22, 2003
A: Defective? My parents were very proud, and they were proud that I could come
to the United States, they applauded that, without an interpreter, just the two of us,
ourselves. Because that world was certainly different. And I learned English. In
Germany, | learned English there, too. I could say goodbye, I love you, thank you.
Just a little bit of English, and then I progressed.
Q: But — but my question is, when you were a child there, in — in the school, when
they were doing these operations, did you suddenly feel like something was wrong
with you, that you — before, you didn’t feel like anything was bad about you, and
then now somebody’s telling you you’re no good. Is that — was that —
A: Later, I woke up, when I realized it was because I couldn’t hear. I was really
very innocent, when I was younger.
Q: So in fact, she didn’t know why they were doing the operation?
A: Just so — I — I knew that they were doing the operation so I couldn’t have
children to perpetuate deafness.
Q: Okay. So she did know why.
A: Yes, I knew why they were doing the operation.
Q: Okay. Do you have any more questions that you’d like to know about this?
Cause really, I pretty much got everything. No, I’m asking you, Ronnie(ph).

Q3: I have one [indecipherable]
Q: Okay, yeah.
Q2: I had — I had a few, but —
Q3: The — there was the conversation about some papers that she carried with her
for a long time, and then were torn up, and I never quite understood what those
papers were. But apparently they were bad papers, the Americans tore them up. Can
you explain what the papers were?
A: It said that — it said that it was — I was a member of the Nazi party, because I was
a Girl Scout. So those — those papers that I carried said I — I was a leader of the Girl
Scouts, and so I had to carry those papers that said I was a member of the Nazi
party. I really wasn’t, but that’s what the papers said. They were forcing me to go,
to join, but in the back of my head, I knew, God helped pull me back. I would not
go in. I had the papers to become a member, but I wouldn’t do it. And every day
when I would walk from the house to the job, and the — I would pass by the soldiers,
I would just feel the fear that they might ask if I was a member or not. And for
years, this went on. After am — America claimed Germany, that’s when I felt like a
bird, free, I could fly free.
Q: But the papers said she was a member of the Nazi party?

A: They weren’t filled in. The papers were not filled in, I just carried them with me.
There were no answers, and I hadn’t signed the papers, so they didn’t really say
anything. I didn’t sign them. An American soldier said I must go to my boss, and
ask for a file, to see if I had anything on my record, but I had a clean record. There
was — the Nazi had a huge file in the basement, and they found papers. And then
because I knew some of — some of the people, some of my friends’ uncles or
nephews, they came to the — from Bulgaria to the United States, and they said, do
you remember — and they asked him, were you a member of the Nazi party? And
they denied it, so they said, okay, you’re accepted. And then they could support
these people when they came to America. When you went to the American
consulate, you had to take an oath to tell the truth. And they asked, are you a
member of the Nazi party. And somebody confessed to saying yes, they took their
file, they put their name in the file. So I was afraid that that same thing would
happen to me, so I never signed those papers.
Q: Ronnie(ph), do you have any questions that — that arose during this?
Q2: As a deaf woman, did you know German sign language? And then how, when
you came to America, did you learn American sign language?
A: I would meet friends, and I asked them to help me, and I —I picked up a
dictionary, English-German, German and English, so I could learn different signs.

And the Lutheran preacher at the church, I asked him to come to my aunt and
uncle’s house to teach me finger spelling and sign language, for one year. And
that’s how I learned.
Q: What happened to your brother, with regard to the sterilization? Was he
supposed to be sterilized also?
A: No, he — they didn’t sterilize him, he has twin daughters. They’re both hearing.
Beautiful girls. He was lucky.
Q: How — how did he manage to escape —
A: He didn’t avoid it, he was supposed to go to the hospital, but the hospital was
full, and it was wartime. And then he — soldiers and people were being rushed to the
hospital. There was no available space for him, so he didn’t go, they did not sterilize
him. He was very happy.
Q: Did you — did you — did your parents —
A: I was happy. People would ask me, do you feel bad that your brother has two
children, you don’t have any? No, I’m very happy that he has twins. I’m just happy
that I have two beautiful nieces.

Q: There was no conver — da — discussions about that?
A: When I was 28 years old, I came to the United States. It’s a— Germany, during
wartime, was different. It was very — a very rough life over there, but it was
different here.
Q: But when you were going through this operation, or when they took — when they
took you for this operation, did anybody explain that deafness was hereditary, and
this was something that they had to do, or —
A: No, nothing. Nothing was explained. Only once did the teacher say, tol — tell us
that you can’t have babies, we’re going to make you not have babies, so that the
deafness doesn’t become perpetuated, and that was it. Just one time. And we didn’t
have any time really, to focus on it. It was a very confusing time for all of us. All
the time, confusion. Now, you’re making me look back on it in more — more in
depth. I didn’t realize about the deaf world itself back then. So they would call
some of them mentally retarded. They would mainstream them in a church. Oh, all
of us, deaf people, mentally retarded people, they would put them — there was a
church, and a lot of the people died, from fire. Most of them were mentally
retarded. They would take them away to this church. And years later, some of the
kids were still alive. Most, if they were deaf, they were allowed to go to the church.

They were healthy, except they just couldn’t hear. And so they would send them
off, on their way.
Q: To where?
A: You know, to — to the gas chambers, to the camps. I didn’t know where they
were really taking them. One boy came from Guatemala, South America. His
father sent him to school for the deaf. He was two or three years older than me. He
went out of class from school. He liked me. He explained all about the Nazis, and
how bad it was, and I learned a lot from him. And I said, how do you know? And he
said, his uncle took care of him, and his father stayed in South America, and his
uncle took care of him. His uncle told him about the Nazis. And they said they will
kill everybody. All the German kids. They’ll sterilize all the German kids. He knew
so much. That’s when we all —I started to become afraid, and he was fearful as
well. I talked to my father, and he would just try to pacify me, and calm me down.
He’d say, don’t worry, don’t worry. My father was very sensitive. My father’s
sister, my aunt — and I asked my aunt, I said, is Hitler bad? I went to Munich for a
na — for a visit with another aunt, and I learned from them that Hitler was bad, and
we should all be against Hitler, but we have to do it very quietly. They’d listen to
the radio, and they’d hear out of their [indecipherable] like from England, or out
of their country, what they were saying against Germany, they’d listen very

carefully. They’d have to be careful, because there would be a knock at the door,
and they’d put them in jail. So I learned from my aunts, then I told my father, they
told me Hitler’s bad. My father said, shh, shh. He was frightened. He said, you talk
against Hitler, he’ll put you away. They warned that the enemy could hear you all
over, didn’t matter where you were. So you needed to be careful if you said
anything in front of anybody, cause they could take you and send you to the camps.
So I learned a lot from my two aunts, and from the boy from Guatemala.
Q: Ask her how old she was when this [inaudible]
A: I was still in school. Maybe I was 12 years old, 11 or 12 years old. I’m trying to
remember. I kind of forget some things, you know, about the past.
Q: Okay, I think we’re done. Okay, we need to sit and be quiet for 30 seconds.
