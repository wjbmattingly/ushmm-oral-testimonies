Q: So you were an only child?
A: I was the only child, yeah.
Q: You’re the only child. What about your father’s service during World War I?
Did you know much about that?
A: Well, th-this is a rather complex story, because since they were living under the
German occupation, 1n a way it was — during the partition of Poland, they were
born in 19 hun — 1899 and 1902. My father had to serve in the German army.
Q: The Prussian army then.
A: Yes. And he was sent to fight the f—1n France, and he was wounded in France.
By the way, when he went to Poland, he stole from everybody th — any
photographs of when he was young, so I have — I don’t know some people that are
in these photographs. But anyway, so he served in the German army, and then he
served — he — not served, but then the — in the western Poland, in Poznan, around
Poznan, his brother and he were involved in the uprising against the Germans, or
the Pr-Prussia. And so he fought in that, and then of course, after the Po-Poland
became free, he was — he m — went to — I won’t say it’s equivalent to West Point,
but it was a little bit less than that. I— I — I would say a military junior college, I
don’t know. But he then finished that, and became a professional officer in the

Polish army, and then when the Bolsheviks attacked Poland, after the 1917
revolution, he wen — he went to fight the Bolsheviks, and he was wounded again.
But these wounds were not exactly critical, and so — so then, he continued really to

Czeporowski(ph) really liked me very much, and I — I am not sure how it was, but

A: Yeah, murdered in Katyn. And there is not much of information on him.
Q: So — okay, so you remember that —

not sure how to — he was — he really was like an assistant to my father.
Q: Okay.
A: And he w — he ca — he was from Silesia [indecipherable] and he — I remember

to —
Q: Yeah.
A: — the one that existed. Th-This was a — really a resort town at one time, because
it was southeastern Poland on the border between Romania and Poland, and there

A: Yes. So he — he — I don’t know the years in which he was transferred. I think he
probably has it written somewhere because he — when we came to this country, as I
say, he started collecting information and photographs when he went to Poland. But
anyway, so that was maybe — maybe a — when I was four.
Q: Okay.
A: When we were transferred to — when he was transferred to Zaleszezyki.
Q: Was this par — Zaleszezyki. Zaleszczyki?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. And was this part — was this in the mountains as well?

other side of the Dniest was Romania, and mountains of Romania were there.
Q: Okay.
A: This was like a plateau where we were, not — not mountains.
Q: Okay. Not mountains. Was it a pretty place? From what you —
A: Very beautiful, yes, yeah. And very unusual, because, as I say, it was a
southeastern part of Poland where even grapes that they had — grapes grew,
peaches, apricots, and so on. Which is unusual because Poland 1s a rather —

lady who built this house, but she herself lived in a —a really very poor little kind of
a —a home, and so we — we rented it, or my parents rented it from her, and she very
often then would take me to — to a Russian Orthodox church, especially at Easter, I
remember that again, because there were birds in cages, and it was an elaborate
production, with flowers and so on.

at, yeah. And the house itself, did 1t have an orchard, or did it have a backyard?

there was an orchard, and there were apricots growing there. Especially apricots and
you could just go and pick them up.
Q: Oh, how lovely.
A: And in front there was a road, and — but it was all — the way I recall it, it was not
— there were not many houses around us. Going down towards the river, more and
more houses were built like — were there.
Q: So maybe you were on the outskirts of the town?
A: Yeah — well, not outskirts, but I would say outskirts of the area where perhaps
people preferred to live, because it was near to the river, and there was a beautiful
sight of the mountains on the Romanian side.

there, 1t must have been for a purpose.

weather was — in summer is very beautiful in that part of Poland. We would go to
the river, to the little beach — at that point in the beach was nothing like it is now,
what I see. But I also remember at one time on the beach there was a huge
commotion because a black man came. And they — nobody in Poland yet saw any
black people. But I will tell you that I already had a black doll.

of course, then she put — had to put vodka 1n it, or whatever, and I si — I loved those

and they always would come, as I recall, we would be sleeping, and around —
soundly, and there would be pounding on the door, and they would come in,
surround the house, go in, stand inside. They would line us around at the walls, and
they would start saying, where is my father, and he — he’s going to be hanging, or
you know, we cut his throat, and so on. And my mother did not know Russian. She
knew German quite well, but not Russian, and had one time — this — this — this was
funny. I, of course, don’t remember that, but I heard it now several times. I mean,
before, several times. They came, and they would open everything and steal,
because they would — they had let all the criminals out of the prisons, saying that
they were really suppressed by the [indecipherable] capitalists of Poland, right? So
they were free now.

farms. But before — I — I — I would like to say something else too. As we crossed the
Ural mountains, and then I know we were in a — well, really — Siberia really is — is
just an imaginary kind of a— a place. But where Siberia sort of borders
Kazakhstan, we crossed to Kazakhstan. The tow-town was called Nowosibirsk.
Q: Nowosibirsk, mm-hm.
A: Si— very big town. We were taken to be deloused, because the Russian thought
that Poles are really a-absolutely uncivilized, because they don’t have delousing
stations. So we were — we were taken t-to — for a ba — for a shower, or whatever it
was, but it — to clean ourselves, and to be deloused. And in order to be deloused,
everything was taken from us and put into, I don’t know, hot ovens, or whatever. So
that no matter where — you had to give everything up, so whoever had anything
made out of leather became nothing, because it was shrunken, you know, almost

we then proceeded to — to where — oh, the — our wagons were left behind, and the
rest went elsewhere, I am sure, you know, to other collective farms, and we were
put on a carts driven then, because that’s Kazakhstan, oxen. And very slowly we
got to this collective farm. The — the village was called Peschanka, and the farm
was a sovkhoz which was even higher than a collective farm, it was Soviet
collective farm, and it was a — a — of the name of Lenin, you know, Lenin’s.
Q: So it was Lenin’s sovkhoz?
A: Sovkhoz, that’s right, s — Lenin’s sovkhoz. So, this was a pig farm. So, w-when
we arrived there, there were already some deportees from Russia itself. When
Stalin took over, there were ex-Russian Orthodox priests, and intellectual — some
intellectuals — I don’t know, of course, who was who. But th — I remember they
were standing, and as we got off, they were sort of — their heads were — shaking
their heads, saying that we — we will get used to it. Neechyebol (ph) privyknesh’,

maybe. I was very mad at them, at what they were doing to us. I don’t remember
being very frightened, but I was always sort of angry.
Q: Well, it’s — it’s a very natural response. Your mother — now, you said that when
you had, even at that beginning of the deportation, your mother was not quite well.
A: Correct. She had that —
Q: So what happened?
A: Well, she had the heart problem to begin with. So, it got progressively worse,
because I’m sure she was very much upset, and so on. So, there were, of course,
exiled Russian doctors in Peschanka too, but they had nothing to give you to help
you when you were sick. But they were extremely good doctors. But they were
exiled like we, because they were doctors, they were enemies of the state again. So,
they somehow wrote that my mother didn’t have to work, which was worse,

A: So — but that was a pass, because then we would si — well, we would really steal
from the pigs. Of course, if you were caught, that was gulag again, but fortunately —

pigs were eating, and they even — even ha-had some milk, which we never saw. And
that we didn’t steal, because you couldn’t take it with you. But makukhay(ph) is a
sunflower from which the oil, sunflower oil —

it, people were happy, including the Russians that were there. Because finally the
Stalin era will perhaps be finished, you know. And I don’t know how, but — how
we got the news that the Polish government in exile in Great Britain started
negotiations already, talks through the — the British officials, with Stalin, or
whoever was th — one of the other henchmen in Russia, they started looking for the

during that summer? Was she still being interrogated?
A: All of us — all — yeah — I don’t remember that that month she was or — you know,

freely through Russia. Well, now — now, think of it. You are in the middle of
nowhere, and you are going to move freely in Russia. So all the Poles — again, I
don’t know how we found out all this, but somehow all the Poles tried to get out
from collective farms, which was not easy. They didn’t want to let us go, and of
course they did — physically it was almost impossible. So I can’t tell you though,
how the news that the Polish government was sending emissaries, or representatives
to try — trying to find us, I don’t know how we got the news. But Zhaglietskis(ph),

A: Nobody suggested it to me.
Q: What are the things that you wrote in that diary? Do you remember?
A: Today I— I am —I am very mad, because they not only looked for lice at — when
I was at school, but when I came to my barracks. That was what. And today was a

Egyptian eye infection.
Q: Okay.
A: Oh, the headache was splitting, the eyes were puffed up, filled with —
Q: Mucus?
A: — pus, yeah.
Q: Pus, mm-hm.
A: And you couldn’t open them, and then they would, of course, try to — to finish
that infection and they would line us up outside in this heat, dry heat, and with the
sand or soil just in — in the air, and you stood there, and they would give you, you
know, drops into the eyes. It was — it was excruciating. And one time, we still were
on these plat — there was no cover, of any sort. And the toilet facilities were
something else. No, ju-just a hole, a huge, long hole dug in the ground, with planks
put over it, you know. Nothing else. And one night, you know, I — I endlessly
probably cried, because you couldn’t open eyes, so my mother takes me to that — I
need to go, she takes me there, and I fell inside. It was horrible. Because you — you
don’t have any facilities to wash yourself.

name was Azar(ph).
Q: Azar(ph).
A: And Azar(ph) and I became friends, because we were almost the same age. And
Azar(ph) and I would go to the bazaar, and I learned Farsi. I did speak Farsi, and I
know how to write my name in Farsi.
Q: Oh, oh wow.
A: Which I did. So, from time to time then, in my diary I write, today, mean Iranian
girls pulled my hair and so on. But overall, Azar(ph) was very good, and Azar(ph)
wrote in my memory book, or whatever it’s called, in Farsi. I tried to have it
translated. It was translated once correctly, and then Adamchik(ph) lost it.
Q: Oh, the translation?
A: Yes.
Q: Oh.
A: Because he wanted to see it. But so, it’s something in there, since you know,

chewing gum. And in Teheran, the ice cream, the Iranian ice cream, I think it was
maybe — wasn’t it invented, sorbet and ice cr — invented? Excellent ice cream, so we
ate that. And of course, again we were fixated on food. So it was — and we didn’t
have that much money. So I remember, you know, in this street, Lazar(ph), there
was some club or something, where the American soldiers were going boogie-

to negotiate for the whole group, there were maybe about 50 of us left, just women

So, in Ein Karem also, there was a — a — it’s like in a valley, there was a mountain

since Tsarists time. They had their little houses, their little church. And of course
they — th-the Muslim Arabs really, were accusing them of again giving signals to

Yehudi, Yehudi? Becau — and there were guns, you know. Because you had
eyeglasses, you know, things like that. But anyway, so we were pressured to — to —

I shouldn’t say we, but Mother was pressured to emigrate to Australia because
Australia was filled with men, but no women. And final — and my mother, we
knew in that, then we would never be reunited with my father because Australia
was not accepting men that were over 50, my father was 51. So — but anyway, she

A: Absolu — yes, absolutely true.
Q: Okay.
A: So, in Stowell Park, there were three girls from Lebanon, that I knew in
Lebanon. One of them now lives in Sherwood. So, we sort of kept together. In the
meantime, my mother was corresponding to — with my father, and he then wrote,
you know, that we — he has a sponsor in the U.S. So the sponsor in U.S. then — a
sponsor meant that you have to guarantee somebody’s place to live in and work.
You had to have guaranteed position where you worked, in factory, of course, but
you had — so we then, Mother and I, I was in — 1n that school for one year, in ’51 by

again. Not only interroga — physical examinations, everything. It took a month, or a

— the — finally we are put in front of the American representative, I think equivalent
to a consul — you know, coun — someone from the American consulate, on the
grounds of the camp. And finally he said yes, but it’s still not certain that U.S.
wants to accept us because my mother has a heart problem, so how are we going to
support ourselves? So, we said, well, we both will work mad — I and — and my
father. So finally 1t— we are accepted, and we then leave our — our — how many

also was very mean, I remember, because he was — I was not used for — to people
who were really disrespectful to elders. And this guy, I find out, is — is just awful to

Polish poetry. But I met very nice Mexican girl there, but the Polish ladies were
saying, why do you want to study, you know, it’s the — you know, just keep

unlike, you know, the Polish [indecipherable]. So, the landlady’s name is
Piney(ph) Biernatska(ph), and she’s just a— she le-learned how to write and read

Q: Okay. A question that’s a little bit delicate. In some ways, did you lose your
father when he left for Romania, and — in 1939, and you didn’t see him for 12
years?
A: I think so, yes, I think so. But it didn’t stop me from sort of really wanting to
find him, to have him. That’s very true. He was a very bitter man towards the end,
after we arrived here. Very bitter, very bitter.
Q: A different person than the one you knew?
A: Totally. Very bitter.
Q: That must have been hard.
A: Yes, very hard. That has been very hard, because I sort of idolized him, you
know. Everybody was having fathers coming back, they were all ha-happy, you
know when they saw fathers, and here it was, yeah.
Q: And also a disappointment for you mother for suffering so much.
A: Oh, that’s exa — precisely. I think that that’s what really was killing me, because
it’s only towards the end of her life, which was — my mother died at 54.

East Germany, they would — they had stopped the bus once again, the East German

Interview with Sabina Berggren
January 30, 2015
A: Well, where we were. They — they — the year that — where we were. I— I—I-
I’m astounded. Who keeps this? How — how did they get into the — the — this
registry. Well, I know it’s displaced persons, but when did they collect all this?
Q: After the war.
A: After the war.
Q: After the war. It looks like most of these are documents after the war, from —
they are from the international tracing service. Do they have a value for you?
A: Yes, because I — I’Il have to per — really look at them more carefully, but it just
comes back what — what I believed was — is true, and here it is Vandorf(ph)
resettlement center, you know, for example, you know. And it — that — and —
Q: So it substantiates your story.
A: Yes, in a way, yeah — well, in a way, yes.
Q: Yeah.
A: Not in a way, yes. Unbelievable, yeah.
Q: Do you think that — do you — this service, and these — this archive is available

Interview with Sabina Berggren
January 30, 2015
Q: What do you think — do you think it’s something that is valuable for people to
know and have?
A: Oh, absolutely. You know, after a while you sort of — I don’t want to say we —
you lose your identity, but you think to yourself — you — you want to connect with
others with similar experiences, and when you go from — when the — the way we
went from country to country, here and there, you lose — you lose relationships. And
then you try to reestablish them, but it’s very difficult, because years go in between,
and it’s totally different when you were 10, and now you are 20, or whatever. And
there were so many — you know, you had friends, but they all disappeared, because
some went to Australia, some went here. I don’t remember some of their names.
And it’s — it also somehow affects you, it seems to me, where you just look — lose
connection with people that you — you really were close to.
Q: And when you see this —
A: And when you see this, you know, it sort of comes with, oh yeah, I really did
exist, it really happened.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yeah.
Q: So it’s not only — it’s not only documentary proof against those who would deny
your story, it is documentary proof to yourself.
