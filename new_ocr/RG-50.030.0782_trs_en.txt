Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with

Mr. John Krawiec, on January 29", 2015, in Evanston, Illinois. Thank you very,

very much Mr. Krawiec for agreeing to speak with us today.

Answer: Pleasure.

Q: Before we get into all of the difficult times of the war years, I’m going to ask a

number of questions about what your life was like in pre-wars years; and the idea is

to get a sense of the world you were born into, the people that you knew, who you

were close to; so that when the war comes we can understand how things changed,

and what was lost. So my first question is the very basic: can you tell me the date of

your birth?

A: June 15, 1919.

Q: And where were you born?

A: Village Bahuszets(ph), county of Przemysl in Poland.

Q: Can you tell me approximately where 1s this place, the village?

A: It is southern Poland now, close to border with Ukraine.

Q: Okay. Is it still within the territory of today’s Poland?

A: Yes, it’s still in territory of Poland, yes.

Q: Okay. And, what was your name at birth?

A: Jan.

them much, because they were hid — hidden somewhere by Poles, or by —

Q: Other people, yeah.

A: — Dutch, or whatever nationality the ne — country they were, an attic, or

somewhere, and they don’t know much what was going on. The only thing that they

were there and somebody helped them to survive. So in Poland was death sentence

for the whole family for helping Jews. And I know one case not too far from my

village from — through relatives and so on. It was really family with six children.

And they had two co — dra — Jewish cop. They got some on attic, you know, some —

they stay right there. And — and they bring the food, you know, things like that. And

I don’t know how they get — the Germans get —

Q: The information.

A: — the information, but anyway, one morning they — German — Gestapo plus

German police, surrounding their house. They get the Jews out, the whole family

out on the yard. They shoot the Jews, then the children, starting from the oldest, and

finishing on — on — on the youngest one, one year old, and then the parents. This the

way was in Poland for helping Jews. And that is true, there’s not — not story. It is

fact. And there were more facts like that, not too many, but — but there were others.

Q: Tough. Tough.

A: Yeah, it was tough. And you know, so it is — and only in po — in other countries,

for sa — helping Jew, there was concentration camp. I don’t know why they got

maybe because there was the large — the — in Poland, there were three and a half

million Jews in Poland before the war, 10 percent of the population. And in

addition, they — Poland was consider part of German lebensraum, the territory the

Germany needs to create thousand years empire.

Q: Yeah.

A: According to Hitler. Well, so they exterminate Poles, not as Jews, you know,

but because they were born. But they use any pre — pretext to kill Poles. They — but

two millions Poles were taken to Germany to work in factories, and on farms. After

any pretext they have to kill, they did.

was young, I — I was strong, and I was tough.

have to go to some schools, you know, large group, and talk to them in school. So

that has some good part, because we c — it depends on the school how much time I

get. Here I got half hours, you know. And over there, sometimes I get hour,

sometimes even more. But here they go through museum, so they learn about the

many things, you know, ghettos and things like that. Well, over there they don’t do

that, so I have to mention about that. I don’t — I didn’t know exactly what happened

in ghetto, because I was not there. I know quite a bit, but this is not the same thing.
