Warren Marcus: Good afternoon. My name is Warren Marcus. I'm today's host of the
museum's public program First Person. Thank you for joining us. This is our 14th year of
our program. Our First Person today is Henry Greenbaum who we will meet shortly.
This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person. \|'m
going the add that it's a personal honor for me to interview Henry as the first year of First
Person many years ago was sponsored by my family in honor of my father who had passed
away the previous year. So this is a very important program for me.
First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share
with us their first-hand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each guest, like
Henry, serves here as a volunteer at the museum. Our program will continue until mid
August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of our
upcoming First Person guests.
Henry will share with us his First Person account as a Holocaust survivor for about 45
minutes. As time allows towards the end of the program we'll have time for any and all
questions.
The life stories of Holocaust survivors truly transcend the decades. What you're about to
hear from Henry is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief
slide presentation to help you with his introduction, assuming | can use it.
Henry was born on April ist, 1928. His family lived in a small one-family house that served
as both the family's residence and a tailor shop. He was the youngest of nine children.
Henry lived in the town of Starachowice, Poland. There's Poland and here's a map of the
approximate location of his hometown.

Pictured are two of Henry's five sisters, Ita is on the left and Rozia is on the right.
In this photo we see one of Henry's sisters Faige and her daughter.
The Germans invaded Poland in 1939. By 1942, at the age of 13, Henry was sent with his
family to do forced labor in a munitions factory. He was deported to Buna-Monowitz Labor
Camp at Auschwitz and later to the Flossenburg Camp in Germany. At the age of 17 he
was liberated and one year later he immigrated to the United States.
Please welcome Henry Greenbaum.
(Applause).
Henry Greenbaum: Okay.
Warren Marcus: You've been sitting too long, Henry.
Henry Greenbaum: | think so, too.
Warren Marcus: All right. How are you?
Henry Greenbaum: Okay. I've got it. I've got it.
Warren Marcus: | guess | should bring my notes. Go ahead.
Henry Greenbaum: Okay. I'll sit. Okay.
Warren Marcus: Henry, how are you?
Henry Greenbaum: I'm doing fine. Thank you.
Warren Marcus: You sure are. Not bad for 85. April 1st, 85.
Henry Greenbaum: Thank you very much.
(Applause).
Thank you.

Warren Marcus: We have so much to talk about. I've known Henry, I've been lucky enough
to know Henry for many years and work with him in many presentations and he could tell us
all his life story for hours and hours and hours. We can't do that. So what I'm going to
suggest is we're going to talk about several topics from his life and he'll share an anecdote
with us or two. And I've already apologized to Henry that | may have to interrupt him just for
the sake of time. So the topics will include, you know, life before the war and some
background about his family. We saw some pictures of his sisters. What happened when
World War II started. Life in the ghetto. And moving to the labor camp, the death train and
then to Auschwitz and then the Death March and liberation. So we've got a lot to talk about
and hopefully you'll have lots of questions. So thank you for your patience with me ahead of
time, Henry.
Tell us about your family and what life was like before the Germans invaded in 1939, please.
>> Before the war we had a normal upbringing. We were a family of nine children. Three
sons and a daughter -- three sons and six girls. And we had a normal upbringing. Very
religious at home. In fact, we didn't live too far from the synagogue, about two blocks away
from there. | looked like a normal Jewish little boy. Had my curls here underneath and my
tassels sticking out here. Never bare headed. Always wore a hat. My main thing was to
play ball, mostly soccer with other children. Non-Jewish, Jewish, we'd play around with the
public school. | went to a religious school. Like a normal upbringing. We were a nice,
happy family. But of course all of this ended September of '39 when the Germans invaded
our town. Didn't take them too long to put on the yellow Star of David on the back and the
front from the babies up to | don't care how old you are. You would be identified as the
Jewish with the yellow star. Jewish everywhere. | had my curls, my tassels and they didn't
have to do that, but they did it anyway. Who could tell them what to do. That was their job

to do.
Warren Marcus: How old were you when the war stated?
Henry Greenbaum: | was two months shy of 12. And then after that went back to public
school the teachers would say no Jews allowed in school. | had the yellow Star of David
and they wouldn't let me come to school anymore after that. So then after they did that, they
stopped us from playing ball, like a curfew. Had to be in the house at such-and-such time.
They would not allow us in the park. We couldn't use the train or buses. You couldn't leave
your -- you had to stay put wherever you were. You were never allowed to leave, period.
Warren Marcus: Henry, can you tell us about your parents? We heard about your sisters.
Your mom and dad a little bit?
Henry Greenbaum: My parents?
Warren Marcus: Right.
Henry Greenbaum: My father was a caretaker in the synagogue. My mom was busy taking
care of the children at home, cooking, busy. We didn't have any washing machines like we
have in America here. Everything was done by hand. When you have a big load, you have
six children -- actually nine, but they didn't all live with us at the end because we had two
married sisters and then one brother was in the Polish Army and then a few of them were
older but my mom kept busy washing and cleaning and cooking. That's all she did.
Warren Marcus: So the war stats and what's the immediate impact on you and your family?
Henry Greenbaum: The impact on me, | was scared to death. | didn't understand what the
war meant. What did | know, | was more interested playing games with other children. |
didn't realize what the war -- what's it all about. But the parents were listening to a small
little radio, maybe six inches by ten inches little radio and at the end they -- you were not
allowed to -- the Germans came, you could not listen to any radio at all. You were not

allowed to. So you did the best, the parents remembered World War I, they said it wasn't
that bad. They coming, they're not going to be so bad. They didn't realize they were going
to be such a mess like what they did.
Warren Marcus: So the front comes towards you and what happens? You were outside
and --
Henry Greenbaum: When the Germans entered, the father was already passed away two
months before the war. My mom was very protective. What she did, she got a neighbor, we
got a horse and buggy and they took us to a farm. She said let's go to the farm and avoid
the taking over the city by the Germans because this way nobody will get hurt. Because we
were not too far away from a railroad station. Usually they bomb that. So my mom was
protective. We all piled up. Not the married sisters. They had their husbands to take care
of. Myself, my three sisters, my single ones, my mom and we all took the horse and buggy
and we went to the farm ten miles away. While we were there, on the second day, all of a
sudden we heard a lot of bombardment because we were not that far away. We could hear
all that. Myself and my brother were out in the morning pretty early to eat breakfast.
Breakfast was there in the farm, we were not used to the man's house. My brother and |
went outside and were still tomatoes on the vine. Took us big cluster of tomato off the vine.
The farmer gave us a piece of bread and that was our breakfast what we ate. All ofa
sudden we saw a Polish soldier coming through with a lot of medals on him. Came through
and what happened, | showed | don't know why my brother knew his first name. He called
him by his first name. Maybe he was one of those guards in the guarding the city, | don't
know that. He might have been one of our clients, | don't know that either. But he knew his
name. Said what are you running from? He asked the soldier. He said the German Army is
three kilometers coming this way and then he said he didn't want to get caught by the

German Army so he was running in the opposite direction. | could not believe my ears. My
older brother said is it okay if | go along with you? He knew him somehow, he knew his
name. So the soldier said be my guest. You want to come with me, it's all right. So | -- like
| say, | couldn't believe it. | chased after him for two miles. | said why would he want to
leave me? | just lost my father, he's my father figure, he's the oldest of the children, the
second oldest, why would he leave me here? | couldn't understand that. So | followed him,
tried to hide behind bush sos he wouldn't see me but | still run after him. A couple of miles
finally every time | stuck my head out, go back to your mother, go back to your mother,
constantly screaming go back to your mother. | did not listen to him, of course. But once
the soldier with all the medals on him put his hands on the front of his face, go back to your
mother. | said okay. | went back to my mom. | went back in there and told her the news,
what happened. David disappeared. He was supposed to take care of the tailor shop, small
little shop. Nevertheless he knew what he was doing there. With him going, who was going
to take care of the tailor shop because of the brothers was in the Polish Army already. She
was crying. But she calmed down. She -- he disappeared. | don't Know what's left of the
war. | didn't know what happened to him.
And then we packed up and went back to our town. Broken glasses of course in the house
of the shop. Mom's always right, somebody could have got hurt. But nobody did. We
cleaned up and went back to normal. Was scared to death of those Nazi soldiers. They
have a gun on them, the helmets, with the boots. They were -- they were scary looking to
me. They looked like Goliaths to me. | was a little frightened of them. They didn't bother
me yet. But then it didn't take it too long they put us on the yellow Star of David. And then
after that, they round us up, the people that lived near the synagogue, they thought that all
the Jews lived around there in the area. So they barbed wire us around five foot fence but

they didn't make a fence, just piled up barbed wire around the three-block perimeter, small
little block. Once we were in there the only way you can come out there is because we
prepared ourselves. We heard rumors from out of town, if you had a job in the factories it
might be better for you. So almost like a life saver, my father was still alive he approached
one of the customers of ours who came in. He happened to be either a manager or owner
of the munitions factory. And my father, he asked him, can you give my kids a job in there?
He says how many do you have? Three of my sisters and myself. We already had IDs.
That came handy later on. The only way we could come out of the ghetto area after we got
rounded up was to go to work and come back. That's the only place. You're not allowed to
stop nowhere else. And that's what we did for a little while.
Then they found out some more Jewish people live in this area in the city, then they barbed
wired us around, they found from the city police where they lived. They went with little
pickup trucks and got them out of there and | don't know how many they brought back but
two married sisters who were not with us, they brought back them with their husbands and
children and other Jewish people in there. | don't know how much time they gave them.
They were screaming, going to knock the door down with a rifle. Not really knocking lightly,
excuse me, | want to open the door. Just bang the door. Almost break the door down.
Screaming raus! Raus! Raus! Chaos. You grab what you can on the pickup truck and they
brought them in to the three-block perimeter where we were. All the Jewish people from that
city was in this three-block perimeter. | think we were like 5,000 of us in that area.
And then we stayed in this ghetto area for two years we stayed in there. Not only my family
had jobs in the factories but other people heard the same news from out of town, to get jobs
and -- the government, so to speak. So some people would make bricks, tiles, munitions, |
was working in munitions. My three sisters were in munitions. They taught me how to make

springs in that factory, metal. We had a lot of industry. Small town with a lot of industry.
Warren Marcus: So Henry --
Henry Greenbaum: That saved us.
Warren Marcus: Excuse me. Now you're 13, 14. Your father's foresight, not really knowing
what would happen but hearing rumors he knew it would be helpful if you could have some
sort of job. Tell us what life was like in the ghetto and how you felt about, you know, how
many people you lived with and what you might have been worried about.
Henry Greenbaum: Well, it was hard for the ghetto after a while. The only good thing about
the ghetto is the whole family was intact. We all were together still. But we lasted there for
two years. We all got filthy dirty, ran out of soap, ran out of food, and we had to depend on
the Nazi Germans to bring us in everyday food into the ghetto area. And it would get less
and less and less. We have no way to go get other food from the other side from the people
that were coming from their homes and the factory. They could have brought something
with them. If they were scared, | don't know the answer to that. But they wouldn't get any
help. We stayed there for almost two years. All filthy dirty, really running out of soap.
Luckily we had one cold water pump in the area and we had enough water to drink at least.
But wintertime, you could not wash at all. You became very dirty, full of lice all of a sudden.
And then we stayed almost like two years and then the order came one day, October 27, |
remember that vividly that day, October 27, 1942, two years into the ghetto, couldn't go to
work three shifts, the night shift came back from work, they kept us all in the ghetto area.
Nowhere else, nobody at the factories anymore and then they ordered us all out of the
ghetto area to a little bigger open field and that's where the selection started.
Warren Marcus: How did the selection work?
Henry Greenbaum: They were sitting there at a table and someone was standing up with a

dog with guns. You walk up with a family. I'll give you the scenario with my family. | walked
up with my mom, my five sisters, three nieces, two nephews and we walked up. Mom to one
side, the two married sisters with their little kids over to the same side as Mom was, the
grandmother. Then they started filling in handicap people, pregnant women, women who
just gave child birth, and that was the selection. They picked out whoever cannot do any
work. You busy with children. Now, if the women want to give up the children and go with
grandma, they were strong women, we could go to the other side, they'll send them to the
other side. But there was no mothers going to leave children, as far as | knew.
Warren Marcus: Did you have any idea what this meant? Did you have any idea why they
were doing this?
Henry Greenbaum: No, not at all. The only thing | thought is they were taking all these
people, they're going to take them to another area of camp and -- because they're not going
to be able to work. So they're going to keep them there alive. We didn't know what they
were doing to them. But after that, after the selection, they put them on trains and stuff like
animals and they took them away. We no longer saw them. After the war | found out where
they took them. Treblinka was the place that they took them. And that was nothing but a
killing center. There was no working in that place, in Treblinka. So the trains were rolling 24
hours a day and lie to them, take a shower. You never come out of the shower alive
because instead of water you come down with gas and gas kills you and that's how my mom
and my two married sisters and nieces and nephews and other people that they pulled over
to the other side, that's how they murdered them. That was going on from months after the
war almost we found out where they took them, Treblinka. They turn around to us, they
chased us six kilometers uphill. We came by the ghetto area, we thought we're going to go
back in to the ghetto area. We'll have more room, maybe more food, a little cleaner, we

won't be on top of each other, but they had other ideas for us of course. They chased us
past the ghetto area. And there was a big surprise six kilometers away uphill on the top they
built for us a slave labor camp with six foot fences, barbed wire, towers and the dogs. And
once we got up there, chasing us, like | said, huffing and puffing, for me a youngster, | could
really run. | was playing soccer all the time. But some other people, they're huffing and
puffing. Six kilometers to chase you. Once they got there the loudspeaker came on,
attention, attention, you must empty all your pockets, all jewelry, money. You take through
this gate other than your clothes or yourself, otherwise you will be killed. People didn't bribe
their way to the soldiers in the ghetto, that day they had to put it in the big box, give up
everything. You could only have your clothes on and yourself come through the gate and
then on the other side of the gate they were directing traffic to the barracks. First time | saw
a bare rack, it's a wooden shack. That's all it was. By the time | got in there, there was
some people already in there and they put us three people to a bunk, 75 inches wide, three
people to a bunk. You wood, no mattress, just a shelf. They gave us a small pillow -- a
small blanket rolled up. We used it with a pillow.
Warren Marcus: Were you with anyone that you knew? And there were also women in this
camp, right?
Henry Greenbaum: Yes, but --
Warren Marcus: Who were you with.
Henry Greenbaum: My neighbors. | was the only one with my neighbors. We were very
close neighbors. We knew each other. And my brother was not in there somehow with me.
Maybe to another barrack. As soon as everybody got through everybody was assembled
and next morning they woke us up early, ID cards over to one side and start feeding in
different people that they didn't send away with our group. And we went on the way to the

factories in the little pickup trucks we went to the factories. At the factories you came to the
guardhouse and they always start, always beating you, use the long whips. We had IDs, we
went back to the same place. But the new people that they saved didn't know where we
were going. Why are you beating them? Why are you causing -- they're asking where they
go. They're supposed to follow us going into that area. And there was a manager there,
assign you to work, the one that is didn't have job. Went like this almost a year, in the
munitions factory.
Warren Marcus: How much food did you have? Did they give you any food in the morning
or lunch?
Henry Greenbaum: The food menu was not that big, believe me. It was one slice of bread,
a little black imitation coffee and you had to work for ten hours. You came back to the
barracks at night in the evening or whatever your shift was, cabbage soup. They gave us a
bowl to keep the soup in with a spoon. There was nothing to spoon out of there. Why they
bother even to give you a spoon, | don't understand it. We were drinking it up. It was
cabbage water, that would have been the proper name for that instead of cabbage soup.
That was our menu.
Warren Marcus: The people in the camp, in addition to being worked so hard were probably
suffering from disease and probably starvation too.
Henry Greenbaum: Well, we did get into a lot of trouble, not being in there | would say
within about six or eight months in the slave labor camp, what happened we became very
dirty, filthy because we still are wearing the same clothes as when you left the home. The
same clothes. The same underwear. The same socks. Socks and underway. The only
way you could wash them is in the summertime with the cold water. They didn't give us any
soap.

Anyway, to make a long story short, what happened is we all became very dirty and full of
lice. We all got lice-infested. Especially during the winter months because we could not
wash yourself. A man can undress from the waist on up and then you don't have soap. You
use dirt from the ground. Put it like a mud bath all over yourself. And the next person would
pump the water clean yourself off. But that doesn't kill the lice in your hair. They wouldn't
cut no one's hair. The reason, | don't know. The men and the women had long hair. Very
long. For three years you had bushy hair. Full of lice. And the lice infestation, typhoid
epidemic broke out in that camp. It was going through very fast because of the type of
sickness, it is very contagious. You sleep with such close quarters. If one catches, the
other two catch it. The only difference was high fever, middle fever, low fever. If you had
high fever, you had no choice. A middle fever, you could go to work maybe or not. But the
low fever, you were able to go to work. You have a little slight fever. | had the low fever.
My oldest sister had low fever. The two middle ones, the youngest of the girls and the
middle girl, all of them died of typhoid during the night. She was there, and the other one,
they had what they call Einsatzgruppen the killing unit came to the camp every day. Before
you line up how many people come to the barracks, they knew how many people the
barracks holds and if they saw somebody was missing, they went inside. Inside they found
some men on the bunks, they couldn't get off the bunk. At the beginning they would shoot
them right on the bunk. But then that caused a lot of mess because they needed a lot of
clean-up. So they eventually went and sent these little pickup trucks and they waited. They
waited until they count and then went inside and got those people somehow out and they put
them on the little pickup trucks. They took them away to the outskirts of the town which we
had to dig those trenches before we run into the ghetto. They told us the wharves still going
on and that we -- they need trenches for the (inaudible) to fall in. Zigzag, six feet by or four

feet. | don't remember how deep they were. They drug those trenches. They knew what
they were doing. The people that came down with the typhoid, they took them in their
pickup truck, in the open field dressed naked a bullet in the back of the head, inside they
went into the ditch. Everybody the same place. When it was full, they covered it up with dirt
and went to the other one. There was quite a few people that got sick. My sister, the
youngest, she died of typhoid. | used to check on her every morning when | had my night
shift. You're allowed to go in. She was in the barracks by herself. Supposed to be a
hospital. She was there by herself. On a wooden shelf. No mattress, no straw, nothing.
Laying there on the top there on the blanket that they gave you rolled up. We used it as a
pillow because you sleep in your clothes anyway. All you do is take your shoes off, that's all.
But | checked on her one morning, she was complaining. And | bring her some rags in,
some clothes from somewhere so she can put on top of the wooden shelf. So she could lay
on something soft. Because she had a lot of bedsores from being this that little barracks by
herself. So | -- it took me about three days or three night shifts and | came in the morning, |
was taking rags that we wipe the equipment off with, | took some clean ones in and brought
them in to her and spread it on her bed. She was -- stopped complaining a little bit. She
said a little bit softer now. Thank you for what you did. And all of a sudden | come in third or
fourth day | came in she was not there anymore. So | approached a Jewish policeman
which we had in our camp and | asked him what happened to my sister? She was there
yesterday. | spoke to her yesterday. She died during the night. She died during the night
and we buried her in the bottom of the stone quarry. Mind-boggling today. Why didn't they
take that sister and take her with all the other sick people on the pickup and bury her where
they had buried the others. She is in the bottom of the stone quarry. Where are you going
to find her? Where? Who knows where she is? She's buried down there. So | lost that

The middle one, | came back from the night shift one day, Harriet was her name, | came
back from the night shift -- we don't have a picture of her -- they let them go to work, then
they let the night shift in. All of a sudden | see her in the pickup truck. She could not line up
for work. She had the typhoid epidemic. She has the high fever. | yell to her, Harriet,
Harriet, (inaudible) in Jewish. She answered me, we both waved at each other. That's the
last | saw her. And | didn't know where they took them. | thought they took them for
replacing them to another camp or maybe some treatments to get somewhere. | didn't know
they shoot them. | didn't Know that. | knew my sister -- | didn't see her die, but they told me
she died. So that was two. | had the older one left with me, she was like my mom to me.
She was treating me really nice, helping me sometimes with food. She wouldn't eat it, she
would give it to me sometimes. She became a seamstress, working on the German
uniforms for the high-ranking German officers.
Warren Marcus: Henry, how long were you then in the camp doing this work?
Henry Greenbaum: One year, one year. Two years in the ghetto, one year in the camp.
Warren Marcus: For the sake of time and word gets out probably through hearing officers
talk that the camp is going to be liquidated.
Henry Greenbaum: Right.
Warren Marcus: So there becomes talk, you hear talk of a possible escape. Tell us about
that, please.
Henry Greenbaum: What happened, my sister -- the tailors came back after they heard the
officer come into the tailor shop, you have to hurry up with these uniforms, you have to have
them ready for such-and-such date because all of you are going to be deported there. After
me helping them with the war machinery three years, we thought -- the tailors thought that

was the end of it. They're probably going to kill all of us now. They don't need us anymore
because we helped them along with the war machinery. Why would they go and leave us in
that area. | don't know the answer was. But anyway, these tailors didn't like what they
heard. They came back and they organized an escape. Not the whole camp, impossible.
How many they could trust? | don't know how many people they were in the escape group, |
don't know. But my sister was involved in that one. She told me the night before the
escape, whenever you come back from the factory at 11:00, if | was working from 3:00 in the
afternoon to 11:00 at night, when you come back to the -- from the factory do not go inside
the barracks, wait for me outside. So | obey that, whatever she says. It's going to be dark,
pitch dark. | don't know how she knew that. | don't know the answer. But she came by with
a Jewish policeman holding her hand. He befriended her. She held his hand. She came
by. | was waiting outside, waved my hand, all three were running. And people were already
getting out before -- escaped out of there before we did. Somebody cut a hole through. It
was dark, somebody got out. All of a sudden it was time for me, my sister and the
policeman. We came ten feet away from the escape place, from the fence. The lights came
on. All of a sudden the lights came on. The dog started to barking and growing and barking
and he started shooting at the hole over there, whoever made it into the hole that they
opened up was shot either wounded or killed. We were only ten feet away all of a sudden
the three of us running and | said -- | was 15 years old already at that time. | was looking
forward to getting out of there. | said who wouldn't, they treat so nice in here, | was looking

and they started shooting again. Anything that moved. All of a sudden a bullet struck me in
the back of the head and knocked me out. From the impact | was knocked out. | woke up a

with me. Everybody is gone. I'm by myself, 15 years old, as far as | knew nobody is alive.
It was happening at that time, | took my head up, | cannot run outside because he surely will
kill me. This time | was lucky. The bullet only grazed me and knocked he down. It cuts your
skin open like a knife, three-inch gash in the back of my head. As | came back | start feeling
my head. Do | have any hairs in there, | didn't have any hole. | just had a cut. Bleeding, a
few days later of course. | cannot get out. So | lowered my head down and as she was
shooting and then | was running towards the woman's barracks. | said maybe she changed
her mind. She ran back into the woman's barracks because not all of the people knew about
the escape. Plenty of people in the barracks. | came there, opened the door up. The
woman almost attacked me. You can't come in here, this is for women. | know it's for
women, | can see it's for women. But I'm looking for my sister Faige. She's not here, get out
of here. She starts pushing me out of here. In the meantime they're shooting. She can
hear the shooting go on. She did not let me in. | sat in the doorway, | was 15 years old,
evidently stronger than she was. | sat there in the doorway and | didn't want to move.
All of a sudden three, four bullets came in from the tower they were shooting into the bunks,
into the barracks. All the women -- four shots came in and all of the women jumped off of
the bunk, on the ground they want. Eye level with me. | could see everybody and | was still
yelling for my sister Faige. | could not see her. The more | yelled, yelled Faige. My first
cousin entered. She was not aware of the escape at all. She said what happened to you
and your sister is not here. Trust me, she's not here. | said okay. I'm alone at 15 years old.
She says let me help you. She took some water that they have in the barracks bucket there,
with water, she took a rag and start cleaning me off a little bit. She had a dry rag after that.
She put it on the back of my wound. Wear my beret. She gave me a beret. | put it around

my head and the rag was absorbing the blood. | still got to leave the place. | can't stay in
the women's barracks. If they catch me there, for surely they are going to kill me because |
have a wound on the head already, tried to escape.
So | waited until almost daylight and | didn't -- until the shooting subsided and were not
shooting anymore. It was quiet, the lights were on, the lights were roving around, the
floodlights back and forth, all around. And then | was trying which way doses the search
light go away from the hole. Not from the hole, from where the men's barracks was. | was
watch to go see which way the flood light was going. | tested it and see how long it takes
them to get back. | said | can make it to my barracks by the time he comes around with the
search light, flood light I'll be in the barracks. And | did that. | lowered my head down as the
lights were Goings away from me | made it into the men's barracks. | said thank God, I'm
safe now. That was not true. What happened was an hour later roll call, everybody out.
The night shift was coming back from the night shift. They were not involved in the escape.
They have them between the two sets of wires. And then they had us outside counting.
Why they were counting still people were rolling out past the hall. Moved, someone was
killed. They still were shooting from the tower down there. And the other guys were down
below. And then all of a sudden while we were gathering he told us to turn in a different
direction. We had our heads in different direction and then we see the policeman who my
sister and | was running with, he was in the upright position on the ground still wearing his
Cap and moaning and groaning. A lot of wounded people next to him on the outside of the
fence. But you could see it was barbed wire, not electric, so you could still see who was
there. And right in the front of us, he took out his pistol and he killed all of the wounded
people. The first one was the policeman. Right next to him was my sister Faige stretched
out on the ground next to him. Wherever he was sitting down | couldn't see him until he shot

him, he laid out, | could see the two of them on the ground. So that time | was like all
devastated. Now | have nobody, not even my sister Faige anymore. I'll be by myself, 15
years old. And then there's -- went back to normal, closed up the hole again. We went back
to our work, regular shifts that you had, and all of a sudden didn't take them a couple of
weeks, three weeks when the guy says we're all going to be deported by such and such
date, and the date was there. And they didn't let no one go to work and they lined up the
freight cars by the camp, not too far away, and they packed us in like sardines onto the
trains we went.
Warren Marcus: Did they tell you where you were going or you had no clue.
Henry Greenbaum: No, we had no -- we had no idea where they were taking us or why they
were taking us. No wharves given to us at all that morning. We didn't even get our ration of
the bread on that morning. They lined us up and everybody was packed in like sardines on
those freight cars. And then when it was finished it took off. They went for three days we
traveled. We didn't Know where we were going. Every station that we stopped we -- that
transport was not priority transport. They let civilian drive through the passenger cars first.
But these cars had to stop and let the other trains go. It took three days. We were yelling
and screaming in unison every stop we made, water, water! In different languages. | know
they heard us but the doors never opened up and never gave us any water at all. Finally our
destination was Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the late afternoon we saw the sign work makes you
free (inaudible) and then standing uniformed men outside the wagons and as you were
jumping off and if you didn't go by fast enough they would get a few lashes with the whip.
And then as we were coming off the train | get another selection started. Again, left, right,
left, right. We couldn't understand what they were doing because you can't ask questions.
We couldn't understand why they were doing that. And luckily, luck was with me, | went

over to the good side. | found that out the next morning. The ones that went over to the
opposite side of us, they went straight to crematorium we found out. They had a number of
how many they need to dispose of that evening or they didn't have any room for us. | don't
think they would care if they didn't have any room, we would sleep on top of each other, they
don't care that.
Warren Marcus: So you had the selection right away. Then what happens?
Henry Greenbaum: | end up on the good side. Luck was with me. The first stop was a
number on the arm. They gave you a number A18991. That was my number.
Warren Marcus: Tattoo.
Henry Greenbaum: Tattoo number. And after that, there was a line coming through. But
they doesn't take but so long to do. Very fasts and it was like experts to do that. With the
numbers. After that the second stop was finally a haircut and there was some guys sitting --
standing up on the chair and they give you a haircut by head clippers. It takes a little while.
The guy that gave me the haircut questioned the wound on my head, the three-inch gash on
the back of my head. He said what happened? He was talking to me in Jewish -- Yiddish. |
wasn't afraid of him. | said | was trying to escape with my sister and a policeman. Those
two were killed and | was wounded. There was a line waiting, he couldn't conference with
me too long because they were watching him. And it was more than just him. About three
to five people with clippers. The final stop after the haircut, leading into a maze. You finally
made it into a shower room. Mind you you didn't have a shower in four years -- excuse me,
three years. Two years in the ghetto, one year in the camp. It was three years you didn't
have any showers at all. We still were lice infested. The disease and we became dirty.
Then we came into the shower room, they gave us soap to wash the first time. And then
you were so thirsty that you couldn't think about washing yourself. All you were interested in

drinking that water until you almost drown yourself you were so thirsty. You hadn't had
water for three or four days. Then after that you clean yourself up really good. Then they
give us a small blanket on the way out and furnish us with a three-piece outfit, striped -- the
jacket, the hat and pants, wooden shoes and canvas tops, no underwear or socks.
Warren Marcus: Did you get a bowl for food? Did they give you bowls?
Henry Greenbaum: Not yet until we got into the barracks and then they gave you that. And
then after that we cleaned ourselves up, like | said, and put the clean clothes on and it felt
very good. It felt like wire not itching with the lice. Your face looked clean. They give us the
little blanket rolled up. Everywhere we were they gave us a blanket. Where we use the
blanket for our head, to rest your head because the bunk didn't have any mattress or straw,
it had just plain wood. So we slept in our clothes anyway. We took our shoes off. Wooden
shoes and canvas tops, we had. No socks. Slide the shoes off. And we use it as a little
blanket and we stay in there, almost like six months we stayed in there, maybe five months.
Warren Marcus: Are you still with any neighbors or anyone you know or are you with
strangers at the age of 15 or 16.
Henry Greenbaum: Some lived in my city. 99% was strangers, guys | had never met
before. Just meeting on the wagon because they -- big people. They were directing where
you should go.
Warren Marcus: My apologies but time is short. You're in that part of Auschwitz six months
and then you get moved to Buna-Monowitz.
Henry Greenbaum: No, not that.
Warren Marcus: That's part of it.
Henry Greenbaum: That's part of it. While we were in Auschwitz there was no work to do in
Auschwitz other than helping them with the bodies of people that pass away from

exhaustion. You can't lift it, the men in charge, the person who was in charge of it with a
little wagon used to happen put the bodies onto little wagon, they would take them for the
cremation. They would pile up, bodies were waiting to get cremated. They murdered
enough, too many that they couldn't cream mate fast enough. That was our job. Too long at
Auschwitz-Birkenau we were told eventually wind up in the gas chamber because you don't
produce any work.
Luck was with me again. What happened is a well-dressed German man came in, a very
nice-looking guy, two guards on each side of him, into our barracks outside because they
were still new. We just -- according to what they say, we were still in good shape. They
were not skeletons yet. He came to our barracks outside and then who the man actually
would point at you. If he liked you, he would point at you, say come over here. You can't
ask what are you taking me more? Are you killing me or -- no questions. He's got guards
with him. So you couldn't do nothing. He took about 50 of us out of the barracks and then
we wound up after that in Buna-Monowitz after that. Either by little pickup truck or walk. |
think it was five miles away. I'm not sure.
Warren Marcus: That's right.
Henry Greenbaum: So | think maybe we walked over there, Buna-Monowitz, a subcamp of
Auschwitz. That man that chose us out of Auschwitz-Birkenau either ended up being an
owner or manager of a chemical company called |G Farben. They were the producers of
cycling gas, bug sprays, automobile tires, synthetic fuel, that man was involved in all these
jobs. He was interested in my group to build the road in the compound of the IG factory with
the cobblestones and the sidewalk. That was our job, the 50 of us, that was our job to do.
By that time it was already '45. It was getting on to -- closer to the end of the war, the United
States send us over the Air Force, the United States Air Force came and bombed IG factory,

the rail leading into |G. They knocked out the rail so they couldn't receive any supply,
couldn't ship out any supplies and they got so bad they eventually bombed on the inside,
knocked out the IG factory altogether. So what did they do? Wait for us to do? They
transfer to Buna-Monowitz and we were going to another camp calls Flossenburg, near the
Czech border. Traveled days and days to get there because of the bombardment. We
eventually marched into the Flossenburg Concentration Camp, two miles we had to walk in.
It was just a camp like every other camp. The same food, the same little blanket, the same
bunk. Nothing different. The only thing different our job, people there before us had jobs in
the BMW factory or the (inaudible) airplane. They had the jobs there before. But we
came -- only our job was to bundle up clothing on people that they murdered and bundle up
coats, pants and shipping them back into Germany for recycling. There must have been a
heap of clothes a story high. Whether it was just from Flossenburg, that | can't answer.
Maybe they shipped all the clothes from all the camps there, I'm not sure. That was our job
right there. The food situation, the same little bread, the same little black imitation coffee.
The same soup at night. That's all | was fed. We stayed there in Flossenburg, it was getting
close to the end already. While they were in Flossenburg we heard some Army was coming
towards us. We heard a lot of artillery on the way, heavy artillery guns shooting, banging.
We were start to go get happy, somebody's coming to get us maybe out of here. We didn't
know who it was. We thought it was Russia because we were next to the Czechoslovakian
border, six kilometers from the Czech border. We thought it was the Russians. But it wasn't
the Russians. It was Americans that came to Flossenburg. But by the time the Americans
came into Flossenburg, they emptied out the camp all of a sudden. They put us all on trains
again. When the Americans arrived in the camp nobody was there. All -- we were on trains
already. Traveling to Czechoslovakia, Austria, Bavaria, all through Bavaria riding on the

train. And this was already close to April or close to February rather of '45.
So they knocked out the rail system altogether and then at the end after that they had no
alternative, how do they get us around? They took 100 people at a time with the two guards
and the dog and they made marchs of groups, marching. We named it Dead March
because we were dying as we were marching. With no food at all on the march. Middle of
February to the 25th of April they had no food. We were eating leaves off bushes. And then
you were drinking water out of the creek. The only way you got a raw potato if the two
guards were hungry and the dogs were hungry, they didn't have any supplies with them
either. Maybe they took with them the farm, | don't know. Went into the residence of the
farmer's house and the order was he should give us only one raw potato. You could eat ten
you were so hungry. Gave only one raw potato and some water to drink, that's all. Had to
wait until the guys got well fed and the dog, march again. And we kept doing that until the
24th of April, 1945. 24th of April, that's the evening we marched into a farm. All of a sudden
they directed us to go into the silo where they keep the hay. As we said all of a sudden
they're going to give us a roof over our head? April showers, we were soaking wet like rag
doll from the April showers. We were soaking wet. They're going to let us in. Some people
made -- they're probably going to put the match to the hay and burn us all up. Other people
no, | don't think they're going to do that. Maybe a lot of low flying planes already, we didn't
know who the planes were of course. On the commercial highway we saw that towards the
evening. The next day we definitely saw more. Why they gave us a raw potato to go into
the silo and some water and we stayed in there. We took our clothes off naked and wringed
our clothes out, laid them down in the hay so they can dry. The next morning we're so
hungry that raw potato didn't do much for your hunger. We were chewing hay during the
night. Spit it out. You can't swallow hay, you're going to choke. Just get some juice in your

system. The morning they woke us up, gave us another potato, never happened before.
Two potatoes, one the night, one the morning, we Knew something was wrong. They gave
us a potato and march from the farm, we march two hours. Nearby woods, they wouldn't let
us go in deep into the woods from the farm. We could see the sky out. We could see the
highway from the distance. So a lot of artillery pieces, low-flying planes again and all of a
sudden we were sitting in a circle. The two guards we had took off and disappeared into thin
air. They took the dogs and disappeared. They told us if we tried to escape they were going
to kill us. Nobody moved. We stayed still. We thought they were hiding behind the trees.
We didn't know what they were doing. But they were looking out for themselves. They
knew this was Army, probably Americans, that they'd end up getting caught by the
Americans. They ran into another farm and changed their clothes and like a civilian. So
that's what they did.
We were sitting by ourself. We said no guards, somebody's going to kill us for sure now.
And as we were sitting in the edge of the woods, low-flying planes again. And the highway
we saw out of nowhere a tank take off from the main column from the highway towards us.
And the five feet away from us, the door, the hatch opens up off of the tank. All of the
bushes and trees, | guess we were wearing the stripes, they could see them in binoculars.
But if we could see the highway, they could probably see us, too. Anyway, the hatch
opened up on the tank and this beautiful soldier, crew cut, very skinny, American with
uniform put his hands on his face, we are Americans and all of you are free! Even now | get
goosebumps from that day. All of a sudden five years locked up in such a horrible place,
such horrible treatment. If someone, an angel comes and tells you you are free, | could not
hear the word "free." | said thank God we are free God. On the march, save me another
day, save me another day so | can see my sister in America. | told you we had one sister in

Some day. So thank God for saving my life. But why did it take you so long? Five years. It
took five years for them to finally send this tank down to liberate us free. So the 25th of April
we were liberated. But we were all skeletons already because we didn't eat any bread, no
rations for three months. We were really skeletons.
Warren Marcus: Henry, we've got to stop here.

we want to hear Henry's responses and just before we're closing Henry, it's our tradition to
have the First Person have the last word. So we're going to have a few minutes for
questions. Don't be shy. Anything on your mind focusing on Henry's story and what he
wants to share with you. Yes, please. Let's get a microphone there. Thank you.
Audience Member: Before the war started and you were in Poland, what did you hear
people -- the Jews saying about what was going on with Hitler in Europe? Did you have any
idea what was going to happen?

about how the Jews were being treated in Germany? Remembering he's 12, but did the

Warren Marcus: Henry has his tattoo. Maybe he'll show it to you later. Just so you
understand, Auschwitz is the only place anyone got a tattoo. Every camp you got a number
but only Auschwitz a tattoo. Other questions? Let's go side by side. This young man,
please.
Audience Member: How hard was it to escape?
Warren Marcus: How hard was it to escape? When? Anytime?
Audience Member: In the camp.
Warren Marcus: In the camp. Well, he tried to escape. How hard was it to escape.
Henry Greenbaum: Well, the escape was easy if | could make it out. Once | made it out
lucky it was a wooded area that you wind up in the woods. But if that situation you wind up
in the city, somebody would report you and rewarded with five pounds of sugar or five
pounds of coffee if you report an escape.
Warren Marcus: Remember the condition these guys are in, these men and women are in,
it's not like they're healthy. It's really tough to do anything, much less try to make an escape.

Audience Member: How were | able to find out about your sisters being killed?
Warren Marcus: How did you find out about -- he lost his sisters in the camp?
Henry Greenbaum: One of them, the Jewish policeman told me she died of typhoid and the
other one, we found out after the war what they did to the patients who came down with the
typhoid, they took them to a -- the outskirts of the town, they shot them into the ditch over
there, an open field. And the farmer would get their clothes, we found that out after the war.
Warren Marcus: For example, his family got sent to Treblinka, one of the killing centers.
This -- survivors found out over the years when information has come out in different ways.
So it depends. Very complicated. One over here. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.
Audience Member: Can you tell me or us a little bit about your life, how you -- were you

Poland, do you want to go with me because I'm going to look for my brother, she said. Well,
| said we're first cousins, my brother in the Polish Army, | didn't know where he was. | said if
you go to Poland, and you find your brother, maybe he knows where my brother. I'll do that.
She went there, located her brother, located my brother in the Displaced Persons Camp in
Poland and she told him | was alive and | was in a displaced person camp near Frankfurt,
Germany. Took him about three weeks, he came to see me and | asked her where we could
have our sister living. All | Knew she was in America but | don't Know where. He said best |
know she's in the Washington area. And with the help of the people that run the Displaced
Persons Camp, came up with an address and we send a telegram off to my sister. And
within one year the two of us came to America and we wind up here in America. We came
to New York. In New York, after | got off, | was waiting for my sister. I'm looking for a

Henry Greenbaum: I'm glad you could hear it.
Warren Marcus: Well, maybe. There are a lot of countries over the years -- at the time who
didn't do too much. There's a varying record. We have a spotted record in the United
States. So how do you feel about other countries who -- even America who didn't do too
much?
Henry Greenbaum: After the war we were mad at the whole world. Why did they let us do
what they did -- the Germans and Nazis did to us. We felt like we were abandoned. We
were marching in the countryside. Some people saw us there. We ran across a group of
the Hitler equivalent to Boy Scouts. They would throw rocks at us, dirty this and dirty that in
German. We already knew the curse words already, so I'm sure they went home to their
parents and told the parents what they saw. Saw people skeletons walking. They didn't
look normal. But yet these parents, when you approach them after the war, they said they
didn't know anything about this at all. No German admit to me, | would like one of them to
say you know what? I'm sorry they did that to you but | couldn't help it. | would have taken
that answer good. But to tell me you didn't know about it, no, | didn't believe it. | don't think
the whole world didn't know anything. They all kept quiet and we felt like they were
abandoned and no one look for us until that beautiful angel soldier told me | was free. | was
mad at the whole world. America, Russia, British, | mean, England, they couldn't get the
three countries together and send a message to Adolph Hitler, wnatever the heck his name
is, burn in hell. So you can't do that to human beings. We're going to attack you. | guess
he wouldn't fight four countries at one time. | don't think so. But there was a lot of politics
here, too, | guess, or over there, too. But we felt like, that's why 6 million, 1 1/2 children of
Jews. And other people, too. And they kept quiet. They let it happen. And they're still
doing it now. Not on that scale.

Warren Marcus: Henry, before we disperse this is your chance for the last word for our
guest.
Henry Greenbaum: I'm not good at the last word.
Warren Marcus: Yes, you are.
Henry Greenbaum: All | can tell you is remember the survivors, remember you saw a
survivor, you spoke to him or you met him or not just me, other survivors, it's a beautiful
museum here. | hope that you will remember that. Don't discriminate against anybody.
Treat everybody the same as you treat -- want to be treated yourself. Feel better, at least by
our lifetime | thought that people will stop killing one another, but eventually it looks like it's
not happening so far. Still people killing each other. And somehow, someway maybe if I'm
gone, maybe take another 10, 20 years, who knows, maybe some people will quiet down
and treat one another the way they want treated themselves. But do remember the
survivors and the 6 million innocent and the 1 1/2 million children who were murdered for no
other reason than just being Jewish.
Warren Marcus: Thank you, Henry.
Henry Greenbaum: Thank you.
(Applause).
Thank you, thank you.
Warren Marcus: By the way, Henry, on our website there's lots more of Henry's podcast,
many other survivors.
