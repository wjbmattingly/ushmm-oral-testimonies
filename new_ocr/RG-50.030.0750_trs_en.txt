A: Something like this. You know, most of the time, when I got married, I got
different world, how to make a living, how to build up myself, how to supply for the
family everything. I didn’t think about this.

Interview with Ezra Sherman

A: Two daughters and a son.
Q: And grandchildren?
A: Six.
Q: Six grandchildren.
A: Everybody two.
Q: Okay. I have a couple of — couple of general questions. If you could speak to your
father today, what would you tell him about your life, about your family? What
would you want to tell him?
A: I will tell him the same thing what I’m telling you.
Q: Yeah. You would tell him what had happened.
A: Same story.
Q: Yeah. That’s speaking to someone who shaped you. What would you want to say
to somebody who comes after us? What would you want them to understand about
what happened?
A: It’s very hard to — even to think what to say. What can I tell them? I can tell them
my story. I can tell them that people should behave a little bit different to us. That’s
all. What can I tell them more? That the whole world, even United States, they
knew what’s going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the — not only
to the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality. And they
knew what’s going on. And what they do? Did you hear — did you hear somebody

give a speech about this? Maybe they were too busy with — with their own war, but
they should at least say something.
Q: A real abandonment.
A: Yeah. When I was hiding, I didn’t maybe think about this, I wasn’t maybe
enough old to think things like this, but after, I start to think, where all the world
was? And they had the power to do something. Maybe not — maybe if they would
threaten Germany that we will wipe you up of the wa — of the war, maybe they
would behave a little bit themselves, but they didn’t do nothing.
Q: You were telling me also earlier that there were young men when you were — you
know, when you were still in the ghetto in Mlynov, who went to the Judenrat, and
instead of giving the gold to the Germans, the young men were saying, give it to us
so that we can get weapons. How do you explain that, that the young men wanted
this, and the — and the older men, the Judenrat did otherwise?
A: I don’t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was
witnesses to this. They begged to them, give us money, give us something that you
give away to the German, we’|l buy some and try to survive. Maybe 25 percent
would survive, but give us something. Let us at least do something, not to go like
sheeps to — to the killing area. I don’t know, maybe this was the — the — for years the
Jews were depressed. Maybe the — they were too religious and b-believing in
something that cannot help us. Can only pray and can believe in something — I don’t

know. I’ve no explanation. As I told you, that I don’t believe any more in this
traditional religion, because when I crawled between the legs to the synagogue —
why? Because I want to also hear th-the praying, and I saw what’s going on,
everybody’s crying and everybody is begging, and the roof didn’t open up and those
... and the angels didn’t come and save us. And what can I tell you more?
Q: Yeah. When — I’m sorry.
A: No problem.
Q: When — when did it become possible for you to open up and talk about si —
because clearly there’s such a cost.
A: The last couple years.
Q: And why?
A: Listen, you get older, you start to think different. With age, you change your
mind, you change your behavior. You physically get changed, and maybe that’s the
[indecipherable]
Q: Do you think your family knows you better now that you — when you have
opened up?
A: I hope.
Q: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you have raised a successful — you’ve had a family, you’ ve
raised children, you’ve had grandchildren.
A: Thank God. Listen, if it’s a will, it’s a deal.

Q: There goes another thing. It sounds to me like you inherited some of your father’s
strength. Because if he knew how to deal —
A: I think so, I think so, yeah.
Q: Yeah?
A: My father was a strong man.
Q: Yeah. Do you think that it was also, because he knew so many people, that that
helped you in — when he knew so many people in the villages, and the surrounding
area, and when you would knock on someone’s door and say, I’m his son —
A: I—I didn’t know too many. I know some of them, but I came in in some villages
to se — I mean, I didn’t know them at all. I mean, they ask me whose — who you are,
who’s your father? When I told them Moshke(ph), then they’re oh, we know him
good. But — because he used to deal with them, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: My father used to — I’ll give you just an example. Every week, he used to kill
seven cows; seven, eight cows. We used to have in our stable, steady, staying six,
seven cows, because he used to supply for them and the Polish army used to come
for maneuvers all summer, used to supply meat for them. They used to supply meat
for the prince, he had like two — 300 people working for him, he has to give them
some food.
Q: What was his name?
