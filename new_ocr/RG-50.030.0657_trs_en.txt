Q: Okay, and so they weren’t — and they weren’t regular Wehrmacht? As far as —
A: Not the regular wehr — regular Wehrmacht, only about five were guarding
around, because, you know, they feared that could escape, could run or — or — or
jump someplace. And second time. Now, second time, there were no people
looking. Germans were angry, and I think they told through the translator that —

didn’t talk, or — or was it that they were horrified?
A: Horrified. I— I would assume. The — now I’m just speculating, I’m guessing.
Q: Yeah.
A: They were — they were stunned that why they should do that? The first
[indecipherable] they were put in the — in the — in the ditches and shot, and that’s
it. You know, that — that’s something else, but the torture. And you know, like si —
little bit — little bit e-e-ex-ex-exploring that, the NK VD, or the — the Russians
tortured, but Germans don’t torture. They exterminate, but they don’t torture. But
