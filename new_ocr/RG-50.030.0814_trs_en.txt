A: Look, end of the war, I was 13 years old.
Q: Yeah.
A: And we — we did all that. And I remember that’s ahead of time when my — my
sister was 14, and she could go out to work, sh-she couldn’t. Why didn’t she could?
Because, when she would go out to work, they would have right — right away to
take her to work camp. See, at that time, we didn’t know there is such a thing as
concentration camp. I didn’t know when they took me fath — they said work camp.
And there were no fathers home from the — from the German people, nobo — no
father was home. When they took my father, they said he goes to a work camp.
Q: So, did other fathers go to work camps, too?
A: No, they went in the army. They’re soldiers. That is the — when did I notice,
really, the difference?
Q: When?
A: When I was five, six, and suddenly the Hitlerjugend. And we were not allowed.

know til the end of the war there was such a thing as concentration camp. Even I —
when they took my father to Theresienstadt, 1942” Forty-two, yeah, when my

Interview with Edith Weinstein
May 18, 2015
Q: Okay.
A: It’s now an — it says now, they told me, my — my sister, I think, told me, it’s now
on there that they made it like a remembrance, that there used to be Jewish people.
Because they told me it’s still there, Augusta Levy.
Q: I see. Okay. [break] So, we’ve — earlier we spoke about your life, about the
complications that came with being from a mixed marriage. About the extraordinary
strength, as well as youth, that your parents had, to endure everything. I’d like to
ask you now, 1s there something you would want your grandchildren to know, and
other people’s grandchildren to know, about that time that you lived through.
A: I would like them to know that they would never go through their life, what we
went through. And sh-should respect people for their beliefs, and what they are.
They [indecipherable] everybody for that. Because life is hard enough without all
the complication.
Q: Now the — you know, you mentioned through your story, something that I find
very unique, which — unique in the degree of loyalty that your parents had one — to
one another, when all the pressures were on them, particularly on your mother, to
renounce your father. What would you want of the values that they passed onto you,
that your children and grandchildren would also know about?
A: First of all, I was very against mixed marriages.

Interview with Edith Weinstein
May 18, 2015
Q: You were?
A: Oh yeah. It’s very hard, not on the two people who got married, it’s for the
children. They don’t belong. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for them. But
now we live in a new world, and I hope it never gonna happen again, because
everybody’s bleeding the same way.
Q: Well, that’s true. That’s true. Is there something in your story, and in your life,
that you would like to share, that you forgot to tell us about?
A: ’'m not even think of it, what I can te —
Q: That you think is important for us to know.
A: I know it, but I would — I can’t think of it. I don’t know. It’s — I think my
childhood, I — I could think it’s — was hard, but still, I like to remember it, because
we all had each other, and we worked for the common goal, and we were very loyal
to each other, what it’s very important. And especially, I give my mother the
greatest respect, because she did not have to suffer like anybody, because she had a
choice. But she did it, and my father and mother, happy. And she stayed a widow
for 42 years. That’s how loyal she was to her father, even she was not accepted
from the beginning, by her in-laws. And I admire that so much. I admire that
loyalty, and I think we have it as such, most of our children, or her children, have
all that loyalty.

Q: So that’s something that she modeled for them, and showed for them, and they
took as a —
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: — their own value.
A: Yeah, my — my — my one sister is married 60 years. My other one was married in
the 40 years, because her husband passed away. Now, my brother is married over
50 years. My other brother just lost his wife, and my other brother married very late,
he has a young wife. His children is only as old as my children. But that’s my
youngest brother, so we all have that value that marriage is very important, and
loyalty that we learned from my mother, and my father.
Q: Of your siblings, your brothers and sisters —
A: Yeah.
Q: — did you talk amongst one another after the war, about everything that you had
gone through, about your unusual family, that you came from a mixed marriage,
and so on?
A: We - we didn’t talk as much, but we just say it is so very hard, how you grow up
in that, and suddenly you live this way. Because we choose the Jewish way of life.
And — but still, we cannot forget that we lived in a Christian world. It’s something —
