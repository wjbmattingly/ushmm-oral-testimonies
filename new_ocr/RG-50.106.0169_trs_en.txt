Q: And please describe Lienzingen to me.
A: Lienzingen was the first camp, and we worked, they took us several kil-kilomers,
we had to walk to a place, a zoological garden. There was no animals, we were the
animals actually, and we dug ditches. They measured up so many -- so many feet th-
the lengths, so many feet the widths, and so many feet the depth. And you have to do it
through -- through the day. Day in and day out, the same thing, may -- we dug those
di-ditches. And it was terrible, very, very bad. And they told us, this is the last week,
and we going to go to another place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better,

to go to Germany. And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we’re going to go
away to Germany. I did make up my mind, I’m not going to go. And I did escape
from the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape,
because you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew
that. And I took a chance, a big chance. I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody
with -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that 1s,
some of them did escape, but they caught them in no time. And th -- when they caught
them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them
-- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they
brought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up. They brought them up,
they brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged. So I knew what’s going to happen
when -- when they catch me. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I
didn’t think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn’t catch me. So
I went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of
bread. Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others
slammed the door in my face. Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew
right -- right away I was Jewish. So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would
probably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn’t know where to go, how
to go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and
there was a ghetto there, I knew that. So took me days, weeks, maybe several months,

way or the other way, left or right. You had to look straight ahead, and they have a
