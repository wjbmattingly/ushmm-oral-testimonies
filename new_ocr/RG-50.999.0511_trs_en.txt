>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. My
name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for
joining us today. We are in our 16th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs.
Esther Starobin, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2015 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We are grateful for
their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share
with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person
guests serve as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through mid-August. The
museum's website, at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of our upcoming First Person
guests.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can complete the
Stay Connected card in their program or speak with a museum representative at the back of the theater
when we are done today. In doing so, you will also receive an electronic copy of Esther Starobin's
biography so that you can remember and share her testimony after you leave here today.

Esther will share her First Person account of her experience during the Holocaust and as a
survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, there will be an opportunity for you to ask her some
questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Esther is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation
to help with her introduction.

We begin with this photograph of a very young Esther Starobin born Esther Rosenfeld.

Esther was born in Germany, where the arrow points on this map of Europe.

She was born in Adelsheim, a town north of Stuttgart, and the arrow points on this map.
Esther was the youngest of five children. In this photograph we see her brother, Herman, her mother,
Kathi Rosenfeld, Esther -- who is on her mother's lap -- and her older sisters Bertle and Edith, her
father Adolph Rosenfeld, and her sister Ruth.

On November 9 and 10, 1938, a violent anti-Jewish Pogrom known as Kristallnacht, the Night
of Broken Glass, instigated primarily by Nazi Party officials and Nazi Storm Troopers, took place. The
Pogrom took place throughout Germany, parts of Czechoslovakia and Austria. In the photograph
Germans pass by the broken shop window of a Jewish-owned business that was destroyed during
Kristallnacht.

Concerned about the safety of their family, the Rosenfelds registered their children for a
Kindertransport, the informal name of a rescue effort that brought thousands of refugee Jewish children
to Great Britain from Nazi Germany between 1938 and 1940. The arrow shows the route of the
Kindertransport.

Esther wore this tag attached to her clothing as she traveled from her hometown of
Adelsheim, Germany, to Thorpe, Norwich, England, to join her Foster family, the Harrisons.

We close with this picture of Esther and her English Foster family: Alan, Dorothy and Harry
Harrison.

Esther came to the United States in 1947 settling in Washington, D.C. She attended the
University of Illinois, then had a teaching career specializing in World Studies in Montgomery County,
Maryland. Esther's husband Fred passed away in April 2011.

Esther and Fred have two daughters. Judy is an attorney. Deborah founded The Handmade
Afghans Project to "bring comfort and warmth to our wounded service members." Initially, most of the
afghans went to Walter Reed Army Hospital but then also were sent to a number of other military
installations including Fort Sam Houston in Texas, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and Bagram Air Base
in Afghanistan. Their goal of making 10,000 afghans was met and exceeded in 2013 and this amazing
project ended. About 1,600 people nationwide were ultimately involved in making afghans for this effort.
Esther was very involved with the project.

Esther and Fred have two grandchildren. Jon has just finished his junior year of college and
Drew is graduating from high school and will attend USC in the fall.

Our audience today includes Esther's daughter Deborah, as well as Esther's nieces Renee
and Tamar's son Solomon. They are in the front row.

Esther's volunteer work at the Museum has involved helping to expand the Museum's
collections of documents, photographs and other items. Esther has been a contributor to the Museum's
writing project which produces editions of "Echoes of Memory," a collection of writings by survivors
associated with this museum. Following today's program, Esther will be available to sign copies of
"Echoes of Memory."

With that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Esther Starobin.

[Applause]
>> Bill Benson: Esther, thank you so much for joining us and your willingness to be our First Person
and for having a number of your family members join us today. That's a real honor for us and for you.
>> Esther Starobin: It's wonderful to have them here.
>> Bill Benson: We'll start because you have a lot to share with us. You were clearly very young when
your parents sent you to England. And although you were too young to be able to give us firsthand
information about life in Germany for your family at that time perhaps you can give us a sense of your
hometown of Adelsheim and your family before the time of Kristallnacht and before your parents’
decision to send you and your sisters away to safety.
>> Esther Starobin: Clearly | don't remember anything about that because | was 2. But my family lived
in the really small town, Adelsheim. It's still really small. | wouldn't really call ita town. It has one
traffic light. Not very big. My father sold food and grain to the farmers. He lost a leg in the First World
War so my mother helped him. He had trouble getting on and off the cart, especially when it was bad
weather.

There were, as you saw in the picture, five of us children. My sisters have told me they had a
really happy life before Hitler and all of that kind of thing. They went to the local school. There was a
very small synagogue. About 10 other Jewish families in the town.

At the beginning, once my sisters were not allowed to go to school, they went first to live with
some aunts, go to school, and then for some reason they went elsewhere to go to school, to Aachen.
My brother was too young. It's my niece Renee's dad. He stayed with his parents in Adelsheim as | did
until | went on the Kindertransport.

>> Bill Benson: A couple of more questions about the life with your family really before you were born
and then your first couple of years. Your father, you mentioned that he was wounded in the First World
War. He had fought for the German Army.
>> Esther Starobin: He had. Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: And your family had been established in Adelsheim for a very long time.
>> Esther Starobin: Yes. | was just looking at something last night. My family had been in that area,
not in Adelsheim but where my older sister was born, from the 1700s. They had been in Germany for a
long time.
>> Bill Benson: 200 years established in their community.
>> Esther Starobin: Yes. Very long.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your father's business and then tell us what happened to his
business.
>> Esther Starobin: Ok. It was a fairly common occupation for Jews, | think, in Germany at that time.
One of the grandfathers had been involved. They sold grain, arranged an occasional trade of a cow or
horse.

At some point, around the time | was born in 1937, one of the farmers didn't want to pay for
horse -- | don't know if it was a horse or a cow, one of those animals, and started a suit. The real
feeling is that was the beginning of the time that the Nazis were trying to close down Jewish businesses
because there was no validity to this suit.

The business was also in my mother's name. I'm not quite sure why that was. That! also
read last night. And I'm not really sure why it was in her name rather than my father's other than the
fact they probably owed some money on the house so maybe there was something about getting a loan
for the business.

They had a cart. They went out and did this kind of thing. Of course, once the war actually
started, the business was closed. They had no way of doing this. And the farmers had no way of
getting grain. So it didn't work really well for anybody.
>> Bill Benson: You were the baby among the girls.
>> Esther Starobin: | was the baby among the family.
>> Bill Benson: Among the family. What was the age range of your sisters and your brother?
>> Esther Starobin: My oldest sister is 12 years older, second sister a year and a half younger than
her. The other one was seven years older, Renee -- seven years older than |. And Renee's father, my
brother, was four years older than | was.
>> Bill Benson: Your oldest sister, Bertle, who lives in Maryland, just outside of Washington, at age
12 -- at 12 years older than you, she would know a little bit from a firsthand experience.
>> Esther Starobin: Yes. For along time she wouldn't talk about much that happened in Germany.
And then after a while there were certain set stories we used to hear. We heard about the story of
Edith gradually eating the cookies one by one from the front room where they were hidden for the
company. Mostly the stories were about Edith, dropping the bread she was taking to the community
bakery and she stopped to play somewhere and dropped it in the creek.

My father apparently was very strict with them. They weren't allowed dangerous toys. Now,
dangerous was a scooter, which apparently one of the uncle has given my sister. The house they had
was on a hill. They weren't allowed to have anything that went fast down the hill. | think it was because
my father had lost a leg. Apparently when they were out playing, it was time for them to come home,
he would whistle them and they would all come running. | don't know -- these are the stories.
>> Bill Benson: Hitler took power in 1933. 1938, of course, Kristallnacht occurred. That event, that
terrible event, convinced many German Jews including your parents that life under the Nazis was likely
to get even worse than it had been. Do you know much about the impact of Kristallnacht on your own
family and what that meant once Kristallnacht happened for your family?
>> Esther Starobin: What | do know, when the people came through Adelsheim -- apparently they
started in one small town and traveled and picked up people in other towns. They burned the
synagogue, took the scrolls out. But my parents' house was off the Main Street and they were not

particularly bothered that day. Bertle, Edith, who was living with aunts at the time, they went off to
school because it wasn't like now where you knew everything that was happening right away.
>> Bill Benson: They were off in the other town.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. And they apparently started off for school and saw the synagogue burning
and were told to go home.

At the same time, living with my aunts who | never met, | didn't know these aunts, they told me
there used to be people that would be in the house at night and they were gone in the morning. So
presumably the aunts were helping to smuggle people out of Germany.

My sister Edy, who loved food -- she remembered things about food, talked about going
across the border and coming back with things tucked into her undies that they brought across the
border. They probably had to.
>> Bill Benson: The border into Belgium?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. She mentioned chocolate but | imagine there were a few other things, too.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned the burning of the synagogues. There were hundreds burned
throughout Germany. But the synagogue, if | remember right, in Adelsheim was not burned.
>> Esther Starobin: It was burned but | don't think it was destroyed.
>> Bill Benson: Wasn't destroyed. Ok.
>> Esther Starobin: | think it's something else now. | don't think it was actually destroyed.

In Senfeld, a little town about 10 miles away, what was a synagogue is still standing and has
been renovated. There's also museums about Jews and Judaism there. And there's some remnants. |
don't know what happened to that. | never actually heard what happened to it at the time.

| think -- there's a man in Germany, in Adelsheim, where | come from, Reinhart, who basically
when | don't know something, | send him an e-mail and he'll write me back. He has looked up the
history of all the Jews in Adelsheim. He has extensive records of that. He has built this museum. He
taught school. He had a little afterschool club with some students and they did a lot of history and
information about Adelsheim.

What's interesting about Reinhart -- many things, but his father was a Nazi and his mother
was very worried about him getting so involved in the Jewish history that maybe it would make him go a
little nuts. But it hasn't.
>> Bill Benson: You might towards the end talk more about Reinhart, too.

Of course, on that night, November 9 through 10, as we mentioned, hundreds of synagogues
were burned, 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps. So soon after that
in 1939 your parents made the extraordinary decision to send their daughters on a Kindertransport to
England. First, tell us what a Kindertransport was and what you can, what you put together about
how -- about how they arranged that.
>> Esther Starobin: Ok. First of all, the only government that said they would accept people was the
English government. And Parliament agreed to accept children who were traveling alone from
Germany and Austria and a couple of other places as long as they did not plan to stay. They weren't
supposed to stay in England. There was a fee paid to the German government to get them out. So in
England they had Jewish groups arranging this and then people traveled to Germany to arrange it.

My sisters where in Aachen, which is considerably bigger than Adelsheim, and they traveled
together in June of 1939. We had an aunt in England who had been there quite a long time. She
worked -- did housework for people. That was the only thing she could do as an immigrant. So she
knew a lot of people this way. She arranged places for my sisters.

My older sister, Bertle, lived --
>> Bill Benson: Before we come to that, I'll stop you for a minute and ask you a couple of questions.

Do you know why your sisters went separately from you?
>> Esther Starobin: We weren't living in the same place.
>> Bill Benson: Ok. So that was the reason?
>> Esther Starobin: As far as | know.
>> Bill Benson: You went several months later.

>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: And then do you know how it was actually arranged to get you out? Do you know if
there was costs your parents had to bear at all?
>> Esther Starobin: | don't know as much as | found out and as much as Reinhart has found out, that
we hadn't been able to. You said you would ask me later, but | was, too. Clearly | didn't travel alone. |
have no idea who took care of me.
>> Bill Benson: The chaperons.
>> Esther Starobin: | don't Know that. | don't seem to be able to find that out. So I'm kind of thinking
maybe | don't need to know it.
>> Bill Benson: Ultimately | think about 10,000 children went on the Kindertransport.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah, they did.
>> Bill Benson: Up to about age 16 | think was the oldest age?
>> Esther Starobin: And supposedly older than | was but | think, like everything else, there were
probably people older than 16 and real babies. | was 2, so | wasn't a real baby. I've read stories about
people just resting a baby into the train into someone's hands.

| cannot seem to find out exactly how this happened. With all of this, my brother was not part
of this.
>> Bill Benson: Right. Because of the age of your sisters, did they ever describe what it was actually
like to go on the Kindertransport?
>> Esther Starobin: That's really interesting. My sister Bertle said she remembers nothing.
>> Bill Benson: Your oldest.
>> Esther Starobin: My oldest sister. The only thing she remembers, she had her ears pierced the
night before she went because it was an old wife's tales if you had your eyes, your eyes didn't go bad.
She doesn't wear glasses, so what can | say?

Edith remembers crossing the line out of Germany and being given oranges and chocolates.
As | said, she remembers food. Ruth, | don't know. She never talked about it to me. | don't know if
she ever told -- my niece is shaking her head. She never talked about it.

So | don't really know. | find it hard to believe. My sisters were smart women. Why they didn't
remember -- | guess it's a psychological thing -- why they never talked about it, why they didn't
remember, why they weren't willing to answer questions when their kids asked questions. And they
really weren't. So | don't know what it was like. And | don't remember.
>> Bill Benson: You don't remember. And it was June when you went.
>> Esther Starobin: June of 1939. Mine was actually arranged, | Know, by Quakers.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Esther Starobin: | have a copy of a copy of the letter that the woman who picked me up in London
to my foster parents asking if they could come to the train station which they couldn't; they lived in the
suburbs. So | know -- one of the times | went back to England | met this lady. My foster parents were
still somewhat in contact with this woman.

So | know how my sisters got their locations. My foster father worked in a shoe factory owned
by a Jewish man. And this man had posted a sign on the bulletin board was anybody willing to take a
kid, one of the children that was coming over. So they had one son and they had wanted another boy
but that didn't work out.
>> Bill Benson: This is the Harrisons where you went?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Your sisters were already there. You were starting to tell us where they went. And
then you arrived in June. Tell us where your sisters went first and if you know who actually met you, if
you know anything about that when you got to London.
>> Esther Starobin: Ok. My older sister Bertle lived with a couple that had a place in Scotland. At
some point they went up to Scotland. She finished school in Scotland. And back -- once she was 16
she came to live with my aunt and went to work.

At one time a policeman knocked on the door and they said, "Do you know this person?" She
didn't recognize the name. It turned out the man she had been living with was actually a spy for the
Germans. And when they had been up in Scotland, he had been watching the planes and sending
information back to whoever --
>> Bill Benson: So a cover for a spy, taking in a Jewish refugee child to be a spy for the Germans.
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely. Yeah. Edy lived with a family in London. And then when all the kids
were evacuated from London, because all the English children were, too, she went to live with a Jewish
family in Bedford. She was very unhappy there. She felt they treated her like a slave. She finished
school at 14 and then joined the British Women's Army when she was old enough to do that.

Ruth lived in London with a doctor and his wife. At some point she went to a family and then
to a hostile. Then she worked before she came here. So she said she had to go live in the hostile
because she wouldn't do her Hebrew lessons. | don't think that's why but | don't really know why. But
it's a good story.

Edy, when she was in the Army, after the war was over, went back to Adelsheim and she was
walking down the street in Adelsheim and people came up to her and said -- [Speaking Non-English
Language]. I'm not very good in German. They knew who she was. They recognized her. A little
creepy. And weird.
>> Bill Benson: All of us in the room | think are trying to imagine here are your four sisters and you go
to entirely different families throughout not only England but as far as Scotland. You are scattered.
You have the aunt in London who had gone there earlier, | think Aunt Hannah if | remember right. And,
of course, war broke out September 1, 1939 so all the Kindertransports were done by that time. So you
got out in June. So you go to the Harrisons. That's where you were sent. Tell us about life with the
Harrisons. A little 2-year-old girl.
>> Esther Starobin: First of all, when | first got there | had scarlet fever. So | was isolated. My Foster
brother Allen is seven years older than me. He used to play with me through the window.

Anyhow, | was spoiled rotten. | have to tell you. They really spoiled me. | loved -- | didn't
really remember after a while anything different. | was afraid of my foster father. | think that had to do
with hearing men with loud voices. | really was afraid of him.

| went to school. They were a very deeply religious Christian family. They belonged to a
chapel, not the Church of England. The chapel had a lot of community, family activities which | loved.
You know, it was fun, sort of like churches and synagogues do now where they really emphasize
community. This place was very much like that. It was owned by a man called Mr. Ramsey. He at one
point through the association in England looking after the refugees was supposed to be teaching me
Hebrew. | am really bad at languages so that didn't work very well.

The place in England that kept track of the Kindertransport children checked up on us and
that. | Know they once came to my school to see how | was doing. | vaguely remember the head
master staying in the room with him but | only remember that happening once.

After the war my sisters all came to Norwich to visit. They were very welcomed, very much a
part of the Harrisons' family. So | guess | never questioned much. | guess | knew | had to leave at
some point but | didn't really -- it didn't really click in my brain.

After the war in 1947, Bertle got notice that we had --
>> Bill Benson: Before we go there, | want to keep you back a little earlier if | can. Of course, when the
four of you came to England, your parents and your brother were still in Germany.
>> Esther Starobin: Right.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what you can about what happened for your parents and for your brother
Herman while you were in England.
>> Esther Starobin: We kind of think my brother went somewhere to go to school for a while. And then
he was home for the Jewish holiday in October of 1940. That was when all the Jews in Bagram were
rounded up in Gurs.
>> Bill Benson: A camp.

https://collections.ushmm.org

>> Esther Starobin: In France. So they had an hour or so to collect themselves. They could take one
suitcase. They had to all go to where the collection point was. And they went to Gurs.

At some point when they were in Gurs -- I'm not sure where --
>> Bill Benson: Another camp in France?
>> Esther Starobin: The same kind of area. At some point Herman -- they took the children. There
was some kind of -- | don't Know if it was Red Cross or what. There was someplace Herman went for a
while.
>> Bill Benson: Service committee?
>> [Inaudible]
>> Bill Benson: So Quakers, again, the American Friends Service.
>> Esther Starobin: In 1941, the United States allowed 1,000 children in and Herman came then.

Just recently we found more information about his coming here. He wasn't quite sure. He
thought his sisters were here. He was 7 and had been through all of this stuff, so he was a confused
kid. The museum found a picture of him that was in the paper in New York of kids --
>> Bill Benson: Picture when he came.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> [Inaudible]
>> Bill Benson: His refugee file was just digitalized and that's how you're finding this out now.
>> Esther Starobin: Right.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Esther Starobin: So he came and lived with an aunt and uncle here. My parents were sent to
Auschwitz, August 14, 1942, and were murdered upon arrival.
>> Bill Benson: You know with precision --
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely. They kept good records.
>> Bill Benson: August of 1942.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: So 1,000 kids came to the U.S., 10,000 to England, 1,000 -- your brother happened to
be one of those 1,000.

Until your parents were taken to Gurs and then eventually, of course, in 1942 to Auschwitz,
did your -- did any of you hear from your parents?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. Bertle got letters. In 1980 when there used to be a lot on the television,
started to be a lot of information about the Holocaust, Bertle said, oh, I've got letters. And she had five
letters from my mother.
>> Bill Benson: You didn't Know about it at that point.
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely not. Apparently it had been they had gotten lost.

My husband had someone in his office translate them. That's the only way | know anything about my
mother.

In these letters -- | mean, it was sort of typical mother stuff; telling Bertle, who was a teenager,
that she was to make us behave, wash behind our ears, make sure we did well in school, we thanked
the people looking after us. There was no way Bertle could do --
>> Bill Benson: You're living in four separate locations.
>> Esther Starobin: Four different places.

At the beginning my mother would talk about how she hoped to be able to join us, would see
us eventually; we would all meet in the United States.
>> Bill Benson: So hope.
>> Esther Starobin: Hope. Definitely hope. Definitely faith in God, which to me is hard to appreciate.

And then there's one letter where she's saying to Bertle, "I've lost so much weight." "keep
your clothes for me; they'll fit me." My father's leg did not arrive with him. So he did get another leg
when he was in the camps. They ordered a leg for him.

Toward the end -- at the beginning the letters had periods, punctuation. Towards the end, the
letters rambled and they didn't have that. But it was just -- there was always a faith in God, even in the
end there was.

They were very nice letters. | also have a letter that my Foster mother and my real mother
exchanged letters. And that's very nice. So! do have that. But my mother sounded like a very
compassionate, caring person. As much as -- Bertle is my only sibling left. She talked about my father
being strict and my father doing things. She's never really talked about anything her mother did. So |
don't know a lot. | know from the letters, which is very little to know about your mother.

| can't imagine. | mean, when my kids were 2, when my grandkids were 2, | couldn't conceive
of how you put them on a train. You have to have such faith that people on the other end are going to
be good people who will take care of your kids. | just can't imagine it.

There's a movie about the Kindertransport "Into the Arms of Strangers." There's someone in
the movie who was angry with her parents for sending her on the Kindertransport. | always look at that
and think what love to try and save your child when you're not going to be -- probably not going to be
saved. So | find it -- there are a lot of things | find hard to understand.
>> Bill Benson: When did you learn about what happened to your parents?
>> Esther Starobin: We came in 1947. | used to sort of think maybe my parents will show up. But
Bertle actually knew. She knew in 1945. Apparently there were lists of information and she did know
that.

| can't remember how | knew. | don't remember her actually telling me but maybe she did. |
don't really know.

There's a book about all the Jews that were in the French camps. It lists their names, where
they came from, how old they were and when they were deported. So it's in there.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to take you back to the life of the Harrisons. As you explained to us, you had
generally what you considered a happy childhood and that was not the experience for your sisters,
particularly one of your sisters who felt that she was more treated like a servant there. But tell us a little
bit more about the Harrisons. They were not a well-to-do family as | recall.
>> Esther Starobin: No, the Harrisons were not. As | said, Uncle Harry cut shoe tops out of the
leather. In their yard they grew vegetables. | guess everybody did during the war. At one point they
had chickens. | sort of remember we got rid of the chickens because the rats came. Well, Allen
doesn't remember it that way at all. So | don't Know what happened to the chickens. They were very
involved in their church, their chapel.
>> Bill Benson: You went to school.
>> Esther Starobin: | went to school. | loved school. In New England at that time, you took an exam,
the 11-plus exam, to see if you could go to high school. | was just about ready to do that. Allen went to
a boys' school that he had taken an exam to get into. Either | had friends -- | carried a gas mask
because there was a war on. There was a bomb shelter in the yard but | didn't remember anything
differently. It seemed pretty normal to me. | was very happy there.
>> Bill Benson: And the war, of course, ended 70 years ago last week in May 1945. So the war is over
and yet it would be 1947 before you came to the United States. Tell us what you can about that time
period and then how Bertle was able to manage to get all of you over to the United States. How did
that come about?
>> Esther Starobin: Well, | don't think my life changed a whole lot after the war was over.
>> Bill Benson: You stayed living with the Harrisons.
>> Esther Starobin: And going to school.
>> Bill Benson: You had said earlier -- you made the point that one of the conditions for the 10,000
kids coming is that they would not stay.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. Obviously some did.
>> Bill Benson: Right.

>> Esther Starobin: But there was help to get people to come to this country. Ruth came in 1947, a
week before we did. She traveled alone. She came to Washington because we had uncles here.
Then Bertle got a notice that there was room for us.

The Harrisons didn't have a phone. So my sister went to the police and had the police come
to the Harrisons’. And that's how | knew. They had to take me to London the next day, which was very
interesting. Now, Uncle Harry couldn't take off work so he didn't come with us but Allen and Auntie Dot
came. Allen was supposed to get a big prize at his school that day, which he, of course, wasn't there
for. We went up to London. They handed me over just like a --
>> Bill Benson: The only child they had.
>> Esther Starobin: It was just like a package. | was a package when | came. | was a package being
handed over. Allen tells me his mother's hair turned gray overnight.
>> Bill Benson: When she found out you were going.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. They knew | had to leave, too.
>> Bill Benson: You had been with them --
>> Esther Starobin: A long, long time.
>> Bill Benson: Eight of your first 10 years.
>> Esther Starobin: When we used to go back to visit, they had a shrine. It had all of these pictures of
me. Nota single picture of their son. [Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Do you have any idea, remember in any way, what it was like for you to leave them?
>> Esther Starobin: Well, it was pretty upsetting actually. | thought about it a lot. Sort of when | went
to England, | cut any images of my parents out. | kind of did that with the Harrisons for a while when |
first came here. But my sisters were very wise. They made sure | wrote back and forth, and | did. We
had been very -- the Harrisons have long died. Allen I'm still very close with.

SO we came here.

>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the trip here.

>> Esther Starobin: | was -- [Inaudible]

>> Bill Benson: Ona ship.

>> Esther Starobin: The Queen Mary. We came on that. The day when we were supposed to leave
there was a strike. But Bertle had a boyfriend who was a butcher so she had a sausage. My aunt had
given us bread so we had something to eat. And children were given milk.

Apparently, and | found this out later, the ex-king -- what was his name?
>> Bill Benson: George?
>> Esther Starobin: No, no, his brother, the one who abdicated. They were having a strike because
they thought it would make a difference that day. So it was just a couple of days.

| think Bertle had a good time on the ship. | just was miserable on the ship. | didn't want to
come. | didn't want to be here. | was going to people | didn't know.
>> Bill Benson: From your perspective, you were uprooted essentially.
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely.
>> Bill Benson: So you come here, you're just 10 years old. What was it like for you?
>> Esther Starobin: Well, | had a new family, a new religion because | didn't know anything about
Judaism, new school. And while | had knew my sisters because they had come to visit, | never lived
with them so | could remember.
>> Bill Benson: And a substantial age difference to you and Bertle.
>> Esther Starobin: So we lived with an aunt and uncle in Washington. This was a fairly big house on
North Capitol Street if any of are you from Washington with three stories. There was another immigrant
family in the house. My aunt, my uncle, my aunt's mother, and their two sons.

My aunt was a little nuts. She used to strip the bed at 5:00. We might still be in it but she
stripped it to wash it. My uncle's brothers weren't talking to him at the time but they would leave food.
My aunt kept a lot of food until it was bad so the food wasn't so good there. My uncle had a temper and
occasionally threw furniture.
>> Bill Benson: Very different than the Harrisons.

>> Esther Starobin: Very different from the Harrisons who never raised their voicings. They had other
ways of controlling us, but anyhow.

| had never been to a movie. The Harrisons didn't go to movies, didn't drink, didn't use
makeup, didn't do any of those things. Now, as an adult, | look back and think maybe because they
didn't have the money. It might not have been religion.

| threw my lunch away every day on the way to school because there was no way | was eating
that stuff. And | went to a little elementary school in Washington. There were half-grades then, it was
like 5-A, 5-B. | was in a grade with three. The teacher was the principal. She made fun of my English.
| spoke the same language and she made fun.
>> Bill Benson: You had an English accent.
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely. Plus | knew everything they were learning so it was kind of boring. |
have a lazy eye. | had never worn a patch. My uncle decided | needed a patch. So | was supposed to
wear a patch, 10 years old, very different from the other kids. | didn't wear that either in school. So |
was not happy.

When | went to junior high, junior high was great. We had a good teacher, a lot of activities. |
really liked junior high. There were a couple of other Jewish kids who also came from families that
maybe weren't as new to America as | was but they were new. So that was good. And there was
actually a Jewish teacher who used to invite us for lunch. She was a mentor before mentoring was
invented. So that was good.

When Edy came a year later because she had been in the Army and had --
>> Bill Benson: The British Army, that's right.
>> Esther Starobin: Once she had a job and Bertle had a job, they got an apartment. So my sisters
were early 20s, new to this country and they took me with them. So sometimes they were dating
people who were my teachers.
>> [Laughter]
>> Esther Starobin: We lived in Southeast and then moved to Northwest, different parts of the city.
>> Bill Benson: You're living there with your sisters.
>> Esther Starobin: With my sisters. | didn't think it was unusual but | guess it was. | don't know.

The thing that was really unusual about my sisters, Ruth when she came over, had lived with
a cousin and had gone to the University of Maryland. In those days you could work at the university to
earn enough for your room and board and your tuition. Well times have changed. My sisters never
said to me -- | mean, it was just assumed | would go to college. | don't know where my head was. Why
did | think that was going to happen?

They never said you've got to get out and work. It could be because | failed typing so what
was | going to do. But they made sure -- | lived with Ruth and David, going to college. David became
my guardian. | never had one before but he did. And they helped us. They used to send us clothing.
We got a little money from Germany. And Bertle said you all can't have the money, that's going to pay
for college.

Absolutely amazing. My parents maybe went to 8th grade. It's like a lot of things. When you
get old enough to think about it, it never occurred to me that | couldn't go to college.
>> Bill Benson: It just was --
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely never -- | knew | had to be able to work when | got out. It was just
different.
>> Bill Benson: Sounds like your sisters were bent on making sure that they did everything they could
to give you --
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. They helped Ruth. They helped me. Edy as an adult took the GED and
went to American. | went to health and register when | was about eight months pregnant, helping her
register. She was really smart. All of us | think she was the smartest. She had never even finished
high school. Just amazing.
>> Bill Benson: You did stay in contact with the Harrisons.
>> Esther Starobin: | did.

>> Bill Benson: That remains to this day with Allen. Just say a little bit about what they've meant to
you over these years and your family.
>> Esther Starobin: My husband and I, we went to visit when the girls were 3 and 5, 3 and 4. | kind of
considered them grandparents. They knew they weren't their real grandparents. Allen was never
uncle. Allen was always just Allen. We went back and forth a couple of times. The girls went by
themselves.

Allen was an exchange teacher to the United States. We brought his parents over. These
were people without a phone, didn't have a refrigerator until we went to visit and then they got a little
one for us. Very simple -- I'm not sure that's the right word. But they got on an airplane and came
here. We had a great time. Well, Allen was teaching in New Jersey and we said you find us a place so
we can all go to the beach. Well, there's a place called Toms River. Don't ever go there.
>> [Laughter]
>> Esther Starobin: Anyhow, we went there. It is the mosquito heaven of the world. But we had a
great time. It was really very special for me to be able to show them my life, which was very different.

After Auntie Dot died, Uncle Harry used to spend about six weeks with us. He loved to go to
synagogue, to the brotherhood and all of that.

What was really interesting, Allen found out a few years ago that his grandfather was Jewish.
He never knew that. So his grandfather had gone to England and married his grandmother and he was
a photographer. And then he left and Allen and his father and brother were actually in a poor house.
But Allen's grandfather probably had another family back in the Ukraine, | think.

But anyhow, my other daughter and her family have been back to visit Allen.
>> Bill Benson: In England.
>> Esther Starobin: He's just part of our lives and we're part of his.
>> Bill Benson: And you've been over there yourself several times. But you've also been back to
Adelsheim.
>> Esther Starobin: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- you mentioned earlier that your sister, who had joined the British Army, went
back to Adelsheim right after the war. But you've been back. What was that like for you? You've all
been back.
>> Esther Starobin: | went back in the 1980s because | needed to know | didn't come from a black
hole. | couldn't imagine what Adelsheim was like. So Fred and | went back. My sister Bertle and
husband were going to come but Morris got sick.

So Bertle had written a letter in German -- because | don't know German -- to them. We got
there. The whole town was dead. It was around 12:00, 1:00. No one was stirring. But after a while we
found the Town Hall. The Town Hall had moved. So then we had to find the new one. They did have
the letter. So there was no one who spoke English. You go to Berlin, everybody speaks English
basically but not in Adelsheim.

But there was one -- the Assistant Burgermeister's wife, the mayor, yeah, his wife spoke
English. We made arrangements to go back the next day. They said, “You don't want to stay
overnight.” | said, “Oh, yeah, | do want to stay here overnight. You're not going to kick me out again.”
So we stayed someplace. We didn't know what we were eating. Clearly the towns people knew who
we were because they pointed to us. But | had such nightmares that night. | dreamt they were coming
up the stairs to get me and take me away. It really unnerved me. But I'm glad | did it.

So the next day we went out and there was a man who actually knew my parents; he came
with us. Then this woman who spoke English. So we went to the Jewish cemetery, which is
maintained there, actually. There were a lot of people from my family. And the tombstone all had, for
my family, all had the same symbol on them which was really interesting.

There's a little museum which is only open on Sundays but they opened it for us to see. We
went to the synagogue. | saw the house where | was born. | saw the creek where Edy dropped the
bread. Just basically saw the place. | was really glad | had gone. Then | had arranged to meet Debra

and her to-be husband and Judy and her husband in England. We all went to Norwich and visited.
Uncle Harry said, “Don't all of you come again at the same time; it's too many people.”
>> [Laughter]
>> Esther Starobin: | was so glad | went. In 2000, by that time Reinhart had taken over for
Mr. Wettleheim because he was old. He wrote they were having a ceremony to remember the
deportation of the Jews.
>> Bill Benson: From Adelsheim.
>> Esther Starobin: From Adelsheim. Bertle said we should go. Renee said she wanted to go. So we
all went. Well, Bertle and | went together. Renee came. She was living in California. She came later.

So we also went to where my mother was from, Rexingen and saw the cemetery and some of
those things. Then we went to Adelsheim and did the tour. There was a program. And Bertle started
to speak. She had a little soeech but she broke down. So Reinhart read it. It was all in German, didn't
understand. But it was very moving. There were police outside because they were afraid of neo-Nazis.

Right? You don't remember?
>> No.
>> Esther Starobin: There were about 100 people there. Some children.
>> Bill Benson: Townspeople mostly?
>> Esther Starobin: Townspeople. They read one of my mother's letters. They had a display up that
Reinhart had made of all the Jewish families and what had happened because they had all contacted
and come back. But it wasn't fancy. It was Xerox copies of things. He had done it himself so that was
very interesting.

When we came back, | did have it translated so | do know what was said. Renee took lots of
pictures. So it was pretty interesting.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn to our audience in a minute and ask them if they have questions of
you if that's ok.
>> Esther Starobin: | went back one more time with Renee's sister a couple of years ago. And since
then Reinhart has an amazing collection. He has our family history going back several hundred years.
He's kept it up with us. Stacey had to fill in all the other things.

If you go this summer, you'll have to fill in more.

It's absolutely amazing. And | think it's strange. He in many ways knows more about my
family than | do. But his son was here as a post-doc. | was friendly with them and his wife. | say it was
probably a little like that. | knew more about their life here than Reinhart knew.
>> Bill Benson: Reinhart is obviously not Jewish.
>> Esther Starobin: No.
>> Bill Benson: He's a townsperson from Adelsheim. So he's taking it upon himself to learn as much
as possible about what happened to the Jews of Adelsheim.
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely. In fact, we have a cousin in Ireland that we only knew about because
this cousin had contacted Reinhart and Reinhart told him about us. My nephew was doing his
semester abroad and he's had contact with Peter and his son. It's a mixed up world.
>> Bill Benson: You left your mom, obviously, and your dad when you were very, very young so you
don't know them. But you've told me that you feel that your mother particularly has had a strong
influence on your family. Can you say a little bit about that?
>> Esther Starobin: Yes. | think she has passed on to us the importance of family. My sisters and |
were very close and my brother, when he was alive. My nieces and nephews, there are 10 of them,
and for the most part they're very close. They keep in contact. We do things together. One is in New
Mexico. We don't have as much to do with him but that's because he's far away. But they really keep
in touch. Partially it's because of social media is a little easier but even before that we really did. | think
my mother imparted to us the importance of that, the importance of continuing life that you don't sit
back and feel sorry for yourself. And we don't. At least not most days. | think that really came from my
mother. And to thank people not just expect people to do things for you but to be appreciative.
>> Bill Benson: The things she wrote to Bertle about to remind you.

>> Esther Starobin: Really to all of us. It got to Bertle but yeah. | think so.
>> Bill Benson: Let us turn to the audience and see if any our audience members have a question of
you. We have microphones on both aisles. If you have a question, please wait until you get the
microphone. Make it as brief as you can. | will repeat it so that everybody hears it including Esther and
then she will respond to your question.

Let's see if we have anybody who has a question. | always have many more if not.

We have a gentleman in the back.
>> Thank you for sharing. Would you talk to me about how your faith has helped you cope with what
happened to your parents?
>> Bill Benson: How your faith has helped you to cope with what happened to your parents.
>> Esther Starobin: | think that's a really interesting question. Because | knew nothing about Judaism
for a long time. When we first came to this country, | went for a very short time to a synagogue but that
didn't work out. And | belonged, as a kid, to a Jewish organization.

When my kids were old enough to get educated, we joined a synagogue. At the beginning |
wasn't very involved. There was a Holocaust Remembrance Committee and | was involved with that
but eventually | got more involved. | had an adult bar mitzvah. | was president of the synagogue. A
few other things. And | think it's helped me to be more philosophical about what happened. | believe
God gave us all intelligence and it's what we do with it and that's what happened with my parents. |
don't think anybody was out to get my parents specifically to get Jews, yes.

| don't Know how to say this. | have no -- | honor my parents. | respect them. | have no warm
fuzzy feelings about them because | didn't know them. | probably had more of that kind of feeling about
the Harrisons who were devotedly Christian and probably think that I'm going to hell but maybe not.

My Judaism is just a part of my life. I'm pretty Jewish, actually, which is kind of surprising
because your formative years are when you're 2, 10, 11. On the other hand, | think in many ways
religion teaches you to be moral. It doesn't matter exactly which species of religion.

Am | making sense? | don't know if I'm answering your question.
>> Bill Benson: | think you are, Esther. Thank you very much.

Do we have another question?

We have a question in the back.
>> Being from Illinois | noticed you went to the University of Illinois. | was just curious if you could talk
about that time there, if you went by yourself and how that transition was for you.
>> Bill Benson: Say a little about your time going to the University of Illinois.
>> Esther Starobin: | graduated from high school just after my 16th birthday. No money as I've said.
My sisters said you can go to Maryland, which they didn't push, or you can go live with your sister and
brother-in-law and go to Illinois. So it was Illinois. Illinois is very much a school where everybody lives
on campus either in a sorority, fraternity, or a club and | was not in any of those. | got a very good
education. | wasn't really part of the life on the campus. | was more -- my sister Ruth, Tamar's mother,
Ruth was taking graduate courses so | helped.

| don't think | got out of college what | see my kids got out of college. In the same way, | didn't
know high school was supposed to be fun. | didn't have fun in high school. Basically | got a good
education.

When | was teaching and they would come up with all of this new stuff, | had learned that in
college.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. Do we have another question?

You told me -- you were in Ecuador | think last year and you met a Holocaust survivor there
and that had some impact on you.
>> Esther Starobin: It was very interesting. | went to Ecuador with some people from my temple. We
went to a ceremony there. We were in this line to get our food. There was a man behind me. He
looked at me and | looked at him and we said "Holocaust survivor." Why? | don't know. It was just
something. So | thought that was so interesting.

| don't think it defines me that I’m a Holocaust survivor and yet in many ways it does. My
sister Bertle doesn't consider us survivors. | don't know what we are. We lost our parents. We lost our
home. Our whole life was uprooted but whatever.

We chatted about what had happened to us, how it affected our lives, but just the fact that we
just looked at each other. | think | look just like an American.
>> Bill Benson: Was he visiting Ecuador?
>> Esther Starobin: No, he lives there.
>> Bill Benson: That is where he had gone.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. | just thought that was really interesting.

The other thing that | think is interesting, Renee's been back, | have another grand-niece living
in Germany; she's been to Adelsheim. Her brother who is there has been to Adelsheim. Tamar was
there with her mother. | was there with Renee's niece. Not my kids but a lot of other -- Judy's in-laws,
my other daughter's in-laws, a lot of us have been back. It's like you have to do that.
>> Bill Benson: All right. We have one more question over here. A young lady in the back or in the
middle there.
>> Would you say that talking to other Holocaust survivors put -- gave you perspective on your own
experience?
>> Bill Benson: Did talking to other Holocaust survivors give you a perspective on your own life?
>> Esther Starobin: Absolutely. As it was mentioned at the very beginning, I've been part of the writing
project here. And many of those people were in camps or in hiding. | think I've been very blessed. |
mean, | was in England during the war but | was safe. I've had people who love me. | haven't had
some of the experiences that many Holocaust survivors have had. That they survived | find
unbelievable. It wasn't hard for me to survive. People made sure | did. So | think it did.

Now, when | was teaching, | taught at a school that had a lot of kids that came from families
that had issues, as we say. | related much better to those kids. | could appreciate that. | would talk to
them because often they were living in many different families and | could say, well, by the time | was
16, | had lived in five different places with different people. | could relate to that. | found it harder to
relate to people who had the kind of life where you're always gone to school with the same people, a
charmed life.

But | do think knowing other Holocaust survivors -- there was a conference of Kindertransport
people, | don't know -- | don't remember when first one was but it was such a -- it was a wonderful
feeling to meet other people who had gone through very similar kind of things. And now there's novel
that have people who were on the Kindertransport and | find that very comforting. Because as a kid,
you read stories and it's nice to read stories that sort of are like your life. There weren't any. But now
there are. There are some books about people who had very similar kinds of things. There's one
detective story where her friend Latte was a Kindertransport person.
>> Bill Benson: | think you told me recently you found out there had been other Kindertransport
children living near the little town you were at in England and that's only something you just learned of
late.
>> Esther Starobin: In Norwich, which was the county. There were 200 other Kindertransport people.
Now, | assume the Harrisons didn't know them because they weren't really hooked into the Jewish
community. But we visited. | met a man who had lived there. We visited his foster family. | said,
Allen, that's -- | says, | don't know how to find her. | said look in the phone book and he did. We went
to visit. A charming lady. He since died but that was very nice to do that. He was also very close with
her as an adult.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn back to Esther in a moment to close our program. | would like to
thank you all for being with us, remind you that we will have our First Person program each Wednesday
and Thursday into the middle of August so we hope that you will come back and visit us and be part of
the First Person program again.

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So I'm going to turn
back to Esther to close the program. Before | do, two comments. One, when Esther's done, Joel, our

photographer, will come up on stage and take a picture of Esther with you as the background. That
makes for a lovely photograph. I'm going to ask you at that point to please stand when Esther is done
and Joel gets up on the stage. Then when Esther is finished that photograph, we're going to try and
get her up the aisle quickly because she's going to sign copies. She'll be available to sign copies of
"Echoes of Memory" where she has been a member of the writing project here along with other
survivors.

On that note, Esther?
>> Esther Starobin: To me, most of us can't do something that's going to affect hundreds and
hundreds of people but we can all do things that affect one person or two people and do good for
people. | think that has a ripple effect. If you can help one, two, five people and they help five people, |
think it's really important to do what you can do to help other people.

Thank you.

[Applause]
