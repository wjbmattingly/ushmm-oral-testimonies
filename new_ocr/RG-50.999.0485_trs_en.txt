Manny is going to share with us his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of our program,
we'll do questions and answers. In preparation for Manny, we've completed a brief slide
presentation to introduce his story.

Let me see -- thank you.

This is Manny as a young boy. He was born to a religious Jewish family on May 8,
1936. Manny was just 3 when World War II started. Although he was born in Riga, Latvia,
Manny's family were Hungarian Jews who moved to Latvia because of his father's work.

This is a portrait of Yehuda Mandel and Ella Mandel holding Manny.

Shortly after Manny's birth his father accepted a post as chief cantor in Budapest.
Hungary is indicated on the map. The second indicates Budapest.

This photograph shows Manny and his father on the streets in Budapest.

The Hungarian government passed anti-Jewish legislation beginning in 1938. And in
1940, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance with Germany. The war and increasing restrictions
made life difficult for Hungarian Jews. Manny's father was conscripted to work periodically in
Hungarian labor battalions.

Here you see a picture of Manny on the first day of school outside his family's
apartment in Budapest. And on the right is Manny as an adult outside the very same
apartment.

German forces occupied Hungary in March 1944. Manny and his mother Ella were
fortunate to be included in a program conceived by Germans where Jews would be

transported safely with Palestine in exchange for trucks. Within months they were transported
by the Nazis to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, near Hannover in
preparation for their eventual departure from Europe.

Negotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in December 1944. About
six months before the end of the war, Manny and his mother were released from
Bergen-Belsen and transported safely to neutral Switzerland. There they stayed at this
children's home where Ella worked as a teacher. Manny is at the bottom left of the image.

Manny, can you join me?

Please welcome him to the stage. Thank you.

[Applause]

Can everybody hear me? Ok.

Thank you so much, Manny, for joining us today. | know that you were born in ‘35 --
>> Manny Mandel: ‘36.
>> Suzy Snyder: ‘36. Your father traveled a lot. Where did he actually do his cantorial
studies?
>> Manny Mandel: If you recall the maps, my father is from eastern Hungary that you know
better as the home of Dracula, Transylvania. My mother is from southern Hungary which you
know better as Yugoslavia.

lt was before the First World War ended. My first started in a small community which
today is called -- it's in Ukraine. He went to school there. Eventually he got to school in
Vienna. Vienna had a major internationally known cantor institute. That's where he got his

training. And his first job was in Yugoslavia, where he met my mother.
>> Suzy Snyder: That was my next question. He met your mother in Yugoslavia. They
married there?
>> Manny Mandel: In 1930.
>> Suzy Snyder: Did they return to Budapest? What was the chronology?
>> Manny Mandel: The chronology has to do with a bit of history. Part of the issue had to do
with the fact that my father being born where he was was then a citizen of a country that was
created in 1918, Czechoslovakia. As a Czech national and as a Jew, he had some difficulties
getting working papers in Hungary. He could not get a job in Budapest -- could not get working
papers. A job he could get. Through a various series of what they call auditions he took a
well-known job in Riga. In 1936 he was able to get the papers done in Hungary. And that's
when we moved there. We fought for the rest of our lives.
>> Suzy Snyder: You were born in Riga?
>> Manny Mandel: Yup. | was just weeks old when they left.
>> Suzy Snyder: | found it interesting. | read through your father's oral testimony. Maybe you
have insight into some of this. But | noticed that in 1937 or 1938 your father actually was
invited to London. He interviewed for a job there.
>> Manny Mandel: Actually, the timing is a bit off. This happened before he got the job in
Budapest. He interviewed a number of places: Holland, London. He was offered positions,
but he was holding out for a position in Budapest. He was still in Riga at the time. So it was a
bit earlier. When he got the Budapest job, he says: That's it; I've arrived.

>> Suzy Snyder: Do you know why?
>> Manny Mandel: He was a native Hungarian, spoke Hungarian. He was part of that whole
culture. To him this was the peak of all establishments. If you want to be a quarterback in the
city, you better play for the Redskins.
[Laughter]
>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. So he returned and took the job in Budapest. You were born in ‘36 in
Riga. You moved to Budapest. You remember going to school in Budapest. Yes?
>> Manny Mandel: Sure. | remember something before -- [Feedback] You'll recall from the
notes, my first experience of the Holocaust was not Budapest. It was no Novi Sad.
>> Suzy Snyder: Yes, | remember this.
>> Manny Mandel: Novi Sad is a city in Yugoslavia, down the Danube River. It's my mother's
hometown. She was not born there but grew up there.
>> Suzy Snyder: | want to back up for a second though. Is this your first memory, period?
>> Manny Mandel: | would think so.
>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. So your first memory actually is in Novi Sad. You can go ahead and
explain.
>> Manny Mandel: Memories, you know, we took vacations on the Adriatic coast. | may
remember something from that. But first memory that has any significance besides playing in
the sand was this experience. It was the first experience of the Holocaust. We went to Novi
Sad to visit my grandparents, my mother's hometown.
>> Suzy Snyder: In 1941. Right?

>> Manny Mandel: Winter ‘41. Stayed with my aunt. My mother had two sisters in Novi Sad.
Stayed in the home of one of them. And one morning somebody comes up and says
something's going on on the street; don't know what it is. Two minutes later two policemen
come upstairs, say to us, “Please dress warmly. You need to be outside. There will be a
census taken."

Now, the Germans, Hungarians, all of the Nazis took censuses every 15 minutes
because they thought if they could know where you are, they could control your whereabouts.

We were told to go outside, which we did. We kind of went in, turned left, and began
to walk for some time. My father carried me. My mother carried me. We were comfortable.
We were cold, but it was winter. We had warm coats on, some kind of big boots and things.
We marched for a while. This must have been until close to maybe mid-day. Then we wound
up in a place which | recognized actually. There was on our left a stockade fence. We were
ambling along this fence. Nothing dangerous was happening. Nobody knew why.

The fence was the fence that separated the street area, city, from the river. In
European cities it is not unusual in the summer time if you have no oceans or lakes, the rivers
become the beaches of the community. And this place had a amusement park, restaurants,
wake pools, cold pools, thermal pools. This was a very nice place. | remember having been
there like six months before. My parents lived in the city.

We were marching along, kind of slowly. We see that the big gates to this place are
open. Folks made a left turn into the gates. As we approached these gates -- | can't tell you if
it's 100 yards, 50 yards. A policeman standing on the corner says to my father, "Mister, what

are you doing here?" My father says, "Visiting my in-laws." "The issue is you are not part of
this community. If you and your group is in some way part of the census of this community, it
will mess up the census. We cannot mess up. Stand aside." Stand aside saved our lives.

By coincidence, I'm sure, within minutes of this particular event the staff guard came
down the road. These guys had a pow-wow. They got on the bullhorn and said, "Ladies and
Gentlemen, the requirements of the census have been met. There's a school over there.
Please go over there. There's coffee and hot chocolate available. Have some if you wish and
go home."

lf you're bewildered, so were we. What we didn't know until sometime later -- | didn't
know until a bunch later. | didn't understand even much later than that. Everybody who went
and turned left was marched to the Danube which had been blasted open from the ice. The
people there were shot into the river. They were found the next spring if at all.

Ladies and gentlemen, | describe to you something which you might know as the term
of Pogrom, a senseless, purposeless, useless, and meaningless exercise in saying | have
power and you don't. That's exactly what they did.
>> Suzy Snyder: So this gendarme or this person who pulled you and your family out was
knowingly saving your lives?
>> Manny Mandel: | don't know if it was knowingly. He just said it would mess up his
assignment. They brought in some street policemen from Budapest. He was a street
policeman in our neighborhood. Recognized my father from the street. My father lived there.
Went to work, office, whatever. He saw. He recognized. He says you don't belong here.

>> Suzy Snyder: But your mother's family did not suffer during this Pogrom. They were not
killed during this Pogrom. Right?
>> Manny Mandel: The aunt with whom we stayed, her in-laws were killed in her home.
>> Suzy Snyder: So some of your family was affected.
>> Manny Mandel: Not the immediate family.
>> Suzy Snyder: You returned to Budapest.
>> Manny Mandel: Immediately.
>> Suzy Snyder: What was it like in Budapest?
>> Manny Mandel: Life was much more threatened in those days by the war than by the
Holocaust. As you heard of what Suzy said in the beginning, Hungary was an ally of Germany
aS a consequence was occupied. The Hungarian Nazi Party ruled the day. And I'm not
suggesting benevolent, but we did not see SS, didn't see black uniforms. We didn't see all of
that which you see in the movies and documentaries. Life was in many ways acceptable. It
became restrictive. You couldn't do this, couldn't do that.
>> Suzy Snyder: For the Jews.
>> Manny Mandel: For the Jews, of course. Sorry if | didn't make that point.

My uncle was in the university. He was in the last university class where Jews were
admitted. But I'm saying the restrictions happen. They did not affect me. As a child of 8, |
was protected in the bubble that was created by my mother and father.
>> Suzy Snyder: Once you returned, what happened to your father?
>> Manny Mandel: From that time, even a little bit before then, what happened is that the

Hungarian male population was conscripted to the Army. They fought on the Russian front at
one point. So the work that had to be done that could not be done by the Russian male
population was done by a force that was organized by the Hungarians, labor force of Jews.
They organized in battalions and regimens. My father would get a phone call, visit or note that
says on Tuesday, be at this train station. You will be gone for a day or two or a month or an
indeterminate period of time. Did this repeatedly from before ‘41 until ‘44 when we left.
>> Suzy Snyder: And he was still able to practice as a cantor.
>> Manny Mandel: He had lots of latitude in that they let him be away from work. What else
could they do? His job was maintained, salary growing; yes.
>> Suzy Snyder: Slowly, though, there's still these restrictions on the Jewish population. Your
father, have you heard -- did he ever say to you if God wants to punish somebody, then his
Capacity to see is taken away? Have you ever heard him say that?
>> Manny Mandel: | must have, but -- would not have said it in Yiddish. Yiddish was never
the language of our home. | don't remember that. But I'm sure he said it.
>> Suzy Snyder: The reason | bring that up is because he said in his oral testimony that he
felt that there was this -- that the people didn't really want to believe their restrictions could be
turned eventually into murder.
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely so. No question. They didn't believe it as they were leaving by
train. The problem was -- I'll give you an example which is not specifically mine, but. My
mother's family name in Yugoslavia was Klein, a Germanic name. Her cousins, her generation
cousins, changed their names to rip-roaring Hungarian names. Not because they wanted to in

some way avoid their Jewish affiliation. They maintained that. But they felt so Hungarian that
they felt they had to have Hungarian names.
>> Suzy Snyder: They were assimilated into the community.
>> Manny Mandel: Not to the loss of the Jewishness. Yeah, they all had jobs and what not
and professions. They wanted to have Hungarian names. They did this. This was something
that was peculiar perhaps to Hungary, to Germany. The population did not accept what was
happening.
>> Suzy Snyder: So your father is coming and going between 1941, 1944, around 1944.
Meanwhile, you're at home with your mother. What are you doing? Are you going to school?
>> Manny Mandel: Going to school. | went to a local parochial school, Jewish school. First
grade and a piece of second grade. I'm 7 in ‘42 or 6 in ‘42 which is when school begins.
School was much of my -- | remember what was then extracurricular stuff which is different
than today. | learned fencing and gymnastics in addition to going to school.
>> Suzy Snyder: And you still had -- you still felt relatively fine, secure, safe, nothing was
going to happen; you personally?
>> Manny Mandel: As a child, absolutely so. There was a certain element of adventure in all
of this. When you went to the shelters once, twice a night, five floors down and stayed there --
>> Suzy Snyder: The bombs.
>> Manny Mandel: Because of the bombs. You saw the allied bombings from one side, the
Russians from the other. There's a certain excitement about that to a child who doesn't
understand the danger of it. He only understands it -- this is thrilling in its own odd way, which

it was.
>> Suzy Snyder: Do you gather in retrospect when you look back at your mother had a great
deal of anxiety and hid that from you?
>> Manny Mandel: No question. | would never question that.
>> Suzy Snyder: She was really successful in maintaining your childhood.
>> Manny Mandel: As | said to you, | was in a bubble created by my mother and father.
Mostly my mother who was there more than he was. As a consequence, what touched me
was filtered. And | could lead the life that | thought was as normal as it could be. My
community was very small. | don't Know if it would have been bigger if no war took place.
Somebody walked me to my friend's house unless it was in the same building. But | had
friends, had these extracurricular things. | took piano lessons. Life was good as | knew it.
>> Suzy Snyder: Right. Life continued.

The Nazis come in March 1944. How did Hungary change?
>> Manny Mandel: It began to change -- Eichmann arrives March 19, 1944, as the final step in
his cleaning of Europe, of making Europe totally “unden rein,” clean of Jews. That was his
mission. Prior to that, other things began to be things that | noticed. They didn't impact me
severely, but | noticed.

An example: Guy says | must take your telephone. What did the telephone -- | don't
know if he was home at the time, but somebody said, you know, this is used for their work. He
says, I'm sorry, the rule says a law was passed. Bye.

All middle class people, Jews and otherwise in Europe, had some kind of maid

service; mostly live-in maids. Remember, there was no washing machines, drying machines,
refrigerators, freezers, or any of that. So my mother and the maid were these machines. And
we had a maid. When the maid was told she had to leave because Jews could no longer have
maids, that impacted me very clearly. She was a young woman, 18, 19. | was about 7. She
was the closest to me in age. She was from the farm. She was not the most sophisticated
thing in the whole world, and she was kind of like my buddy of sorts. During the day, morning,
whatever. Then she had to leave. All of a sudden, Margit was gone. She was gone.
>> Suzy Snyder: How did it impact your mother? At this point your mother clearly needs to do
something.
>> Manny Mandel: The impact on her life, her emotions, what?
>> Suzy Snyder: Her life, trying to save the two of you.
>> Manny Mandel: Well, | don't think she had any options to do anything of her own. She's
there essentially in what we now call a single mother. My father was gallivanting wherever he
is, not by choice. She has all of the work to do by herself. And I'm talking about physical work.
>> Suzy Snyder: What happened with your apartment?
>> Manny Mandel: We remained. We left from that apartment when we left for the train in
1944. The apartment was there after the war. My father came back and saw the apartment.
And my granddaughter, who was in Europe a year ago, even less, visited the apartment. It's
there. That did not change. We had a very lovely apartment. My school -- my apartment was
number 13 on the street. The school was number 44. From my parents’ bedroom, around the
corner of the apartment looking out, they could see the school.

One of the changes, I'm told, at times people followed me to school to make sure | get there.
Because it was not unusual to have a kid wear a yellow star, which was another change --
>> Suzy Snyder: Picked off the street.
>> Manny Mandel: Whacked on the back of the head and left there without any concern. So |
never knew this.
>> Suzy Snyder: You never felt -- there was no anti-Semitism directed towards you by other
kids?
>> Manny Mandel: | went to a Jewish school. In the good days of Budapest, 20% of the city
was Jewish. It became even 40% a little bit later. Anti-Semitism couldn't rear its head
internally. Though, my next door neighbor in the apartments were two girls, very good friends,
two Catholic girls. | did not experience any anti-Semitic remarks from them or their family. |
remember the father being in the house.
>> Suzy Snyder: What did your mother do -- at this point, deportations are starting. Jews are
being deported.
>> Manny Mandel: Not in Budapest.
>> Suzy Snyder: But there's rumor that they're happening elsewhere.
>> Manny Mandel: Yes.
>> Suzy Snyder: And so your mother secures train passage for you and your uncle. Can you
describe what happened?
>> Manny Mandel: No. No. No. It came the other way. | am sure -- Eichmann arrives in
Budapest 19th of March, 1944. Within a day or two or three at the top, two men from a

so-called self-appointed rescue committee approach Eichmann.
>> Suzy Snyder: Two Jewish men?
>> Manny Mandel: Two Jewish men, Rudolf Kastner and Joel Brand -- you need to
understand that Eichmann comes to town as the Caesar of the community. He is the biggest
dog in town. Anything he wants, he can do. Anybody he wants to kill he can by himself or
anybody else. These two guys have the guts, the gall, to demand an audience with him.
Demand.

As it happened, Kastner was a lawyer who spoke German. Brand was an engineer
who lived in Germany. They talked in German. That was not unusual. They began to discuss
some questions about how could there be some kind of arrangements to save some members
of the community. Because when Eichmann arrives, within hours literally 12,000 people are
deported daily. That's when the deportation begins.
>> Suzy Snyder: To Auschwitz?
>> Manny Mandel: To places, Auschwitz, other places. Eventually Auschwitz, but sometimes
not directly.

The discussions begin with the following proposition. If Eichmann will release a million
Jews from the various camps, he will receive for that 10,000 trucks loaded with materiel to be
used against the Eastern front.
>> Suzy Snyder: The war effort. Because at this point Germany is starting to suffer during the
war effort.
>> Manny Mandel: They know that they are lost. Everybody there knew they were lost except

for Hitler himself who wouldn't believe it. But the problem is Eichmann does not have a million
people under his control anymore. And secondly, these guys couldn't come up with the spare
tire let alone 10,000 trucks. One of the two is sent to Egypt to talk to the British, the British
allies to negotiate trucks. The chances of that happening are what we usually call a snowball
in hell in that there were no trucks available. The British wouldn't give it to them. If | was the
British, | wouldn't give trucks to the Germans.

And as you remember, the opportunities for Jewish populations to be saved in Europe
were very low on the whole totem pole in every country. Having said that, these discussions
continued and continued and continued from March until May. And then in June there was a
decision made whereby there would be a test group taken of 1,700-some people for significant
amounts of valuables. The European -- this is not money. Money was useless unless you had
dollars or pound, sterling, British money. Nobody did. But diamonds, jewelry, small pieces of
gold, nuggets, anything that could be used as a valuable.

As you remember, Eichmann is taken by the Israeli secret service in Argentina. He
funded his life. So did many of the others through these kinds of -- not to say our money but
through these moneys. By this time the issue goes to Himmler. They're looking to negotiate to
save themselves from being war crime eligible and other things. The 1,600 people, 1,700
people are collected.

| think that my uncle was more involved in that than my mother. But my uncle who
was active in certain communities in Hungary and my father who was a known human being in
the city, they were able to secure these spaces.

>> Suzy Snyder: So he didn't look for the first 1,700 people. He put people's names on a list.
>> Manny Mandel: He was presented with a list.
>> Suzy Snyder: We've talked about this before. There is this question, -- Kastner happens to
be a polarizing figure in the Holocaust because there are people who feel that what he did was
wrong, playing God. There are people who feel that he didn't have a choice; he saved the
people that he could save.

| don't have an opinion. Well, | have an opinion but it changes all the time, especially
after | talk to Manny. Your feeling is more like he had a chance to save 1,700 people.
>> Manny Mandel: Period. And he did.
>> Suzy Snyder: And these people were supposed to go to Palestine. You were all supposed
to go to Palestine.
>> Manny Mandel: You may be much more familiar with Wallenberg. Wallenberg issued exit
visas from Hungary by the thousands, made them Swedish citizens which let them leave.
>> Suzy Snyder: [Inaudible]
>> Manny Mandel: Right. Kastner was able to do something else. Most every Jew in
Hungary, to my knowledge, had some kind of interest in the so-called Palestine, in the future
sometime. My father talked about becoming a farmer, growing orchards with the little
horse-drawn buggy when he retires. They used these papers which were given out by the
Jewish National Fund as cantors as documents of having been displaced persons because of
the war.

Folks, if you believe that, | have several $3 I'd like to give you.

>> Suzy Snyder: In this case, you and your mother, your uncle, were included on this train.
And this train did not go to Palestine.
>> Manny Mandel: We were supposed to go to a neutral port, to a place -- on ships to go to
Palestine. On the way to the neutral port, maybe in Spain, which was a neutral country -- even
Germany or Turkey -- we were, whatever the word is, kidnapped into a kind of camp which we
were told would be a three-day R & R camp before we get on ships. The name was
Bergen-Belsen.
>> Suzy Snyder: You remember being transported?
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.
>> Suzy Snyder: What was it like?
>> Manny Mandel: The transportation to the camp was in cattle cars. Those of you who have
been through the Museum, all the way through, will see them upstairs.
>> Suzy Snyder: When you got on to cattle cars, do you think she panicked?
>> Manny Mandel: She was not the panic kind. My recollection is not -- most people didn't.
Again, we had no idea -- we were supposed to go to some port to get on a ship. We realized
that first class cars were not available. Now, cattle car was well below what we expected but it
was a transport means.
>> Suzy Snyder: How long were you on the cattle car?
>> Manny Mandel: Nine days. This is July. Weather was warm. In the evening we could
come out. They would unlock the doors. We could come out and sleep on the ground.

There's nothing evident.

We had some food with us. We were told to pack food. Some. For several days. We
were brought food in field kitchens by the military where we stopped. This happened every
night until we got to Bergen-Belsen.
>> Suzy Snyder: Do you remember first arriving in Belsen?
>> Manny Mandel: It looked like a camp of which | had never been familiar. We had a long
walk from the platform of the train station; 20 minutes or so. We carried the luggage. Some
came by truck. These were bunk beds; three up. Again, you could see those in the museum.
And there was no impression on me except wonderment as to what the devil is this. | had
never seen this before.
>> Suzy Snyder: Back up for a second. You said you walked from the train station, the
platform. It was just a platform, | think, to the camp. So you and | both have been back there.
It's miles. It's not a block. You're -- [Inaudible]

>> Suzy Snyder: It wasn't a three-hour trek but you were walking passed village people,
through a village. Did people see you? Did people wonder where you were coming from?

words, permanent buildings. And | saw that. And | saw the barbed wire. | don't know whether
the villagers at that point, either from Bergen or Belsen were, in fact, lining those streets at that
time. If they did, | don't remember.
>> Suzy Snyder: Do you believe the postwar information that people could not have known
what was going on?
>> Manny Mandel: No.
>> Suzy Snyder: You don't believe that to be true?
>> Manny Mandel: No. Because how can you not know that there is a train traffic that's
enormous, not remember? Bergen-Belsen is different than others. It was nota killing camp. It
was a working camp and a transit camp. People were there and then sent to various places.
So the stench of the ovens at least could not be claimed as having not been noticed by the
local population as in Auschwitz.
>> Suzy Snyder: Let me just clarify that by saying that it was an awful place. When they
liberated Belsen, people were dying in the hundreds. There was Typhus. There was
dysentery, starvation. You've heard that.
>> Manny Mandel: People in Bergen-Belsen did not die in a crematorium. They died, in fact,
from Typhus, from malnutrition, and from starvation, absolutely. And those bodies were there.
But | guess that was not -- the community -- this was, as all camps were, they were encircled
by barbed wire and other things. So the community -- the villagers didn't come. And the fact
that they didn't know what was happening at all is something that I'm not willing to believe
under any circumstances.

>> Suzy Snyder: You yourself, you were sick in Bergen-Belsen, were you not?
>> Manny Mandel: Yup.
>> Suzy Snyder: How long was it before you became ill?
>> Manny Mandel: We got there in July. | was probably ill for much of August and September.
Maybe late in August and through September. There was a better part of six weeks. | had
pneumonia. | did two things in Bergen-Belsen very well. | was sick. | did that very well. And |
was bored. | did that very well as well.

The problem with the sickness was, as you may know and probably do know, that as
today antibiotics take care of pneumonia. Penicillin had just been invented. | assure you the
first place to be used was not in Bergen-Belsen. So all they could -- we had physicians with
us. But they had no material or means of helping except old-fashioned medication.

Somehow they found some burlap material. And somehow they found some mustard.
What they did is they soaked the mustard in water and soaked the burlap bag in mustard. Ok?
At which point they draped it over my chest. The outcome that is it acted like Bengay or
mentholated stuff which made it warm. It didn't cure a damn thing but it made it feel better.

[Laughter]
>> Suzy Snyder: How was your mother in the camp? Was she also ill?
>> Manny Mandel: No. It happens that the barracks arranged, the section next us was the
wash room. This was a long trench of spigots and basins. The toilets were someplace else.
My mother insisted every morning, as long as | could walk out, | would go there with her and
get washed. If you were clean, you were healthier. | think she was right.

>> Suzy Snyder: I've heard this before. Do you feel like she sort of made you go through the
motions because she felt like it was important to keep regularity in your life?
>> Manny Mandel: Oh, absolutely. But that was regularity in my life. But camp itself, and this
is to me an amazing kind of thing to report, folks -- instead of asking, I'm going to tell you.
Within a week or 10 days of the camps' stagement, once the leadership was able to find out
that we are here and we're not leaving in three days -- [Inaudible] that much they knew. In
order to establish some sense of normalcy, some sense of normalcy, businesses opened up. |
would think that you would be shocked.
>> Suzy Snyder: Let me just interrupt for a second. | just wanted to clarify. All 1,700 people
on this train were together?
>> Manny Mandel: We were sectioned off into a men's section, barracks, into women's
barracks and family barracks.
>> Suzy Snyder: Were you intergrade with other --
>> Manny Mandel: No, no, no. We were segregated into so-called Hungarian camp. And we
had one major, major advantage over all of the others. We were not turned out to work every
day. Why? Because we were this bartering group. We were either the goose or egg that was
laid. If they killed us, they had nothing to barter with. So our total group in this section of the
Bergen-Belsen camp were there all day long. Nobody left. Nobody came.
>> Suzy Snyder: I'm sorry to interrupt. Continue.
>> Manny Mandel: What I'm saying is that businesses opened up. What were the
businesses? Well, in the larger sense, in order to maintain some sense of stability and some

sense of sanity, you want to do as much of what is normal as it is you possibly can. Well,
people couldn't do many things. We bought, for example -- somebody invented a system
whereby you could have tin cans -- this is back in Budapest. Tin cans which you could put hot,
cooked food and have it resealed that would maintain -- it wouldn't spoil, wouldn't become
rancid for a period of time. Some pressure thing that took all the air out of it and sealed it.
Most everybody brought some of these tin cans with them as well as other things. The tin
cans were used for food in addition to what we were given. | can talk about that if you like in a
minute. But the point is we were given the food. And when the tin cans were emptied, they
cut them up. They made jewelry out of them, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, and the
guy who made that would trade for two cigarettes.
>> Suzy Snyder: Or additional food.
>> Manny Mandel: Anything you want to think of.
>> Suzy Snyder: If you had brought the food in, would you have had enough?
>> Manny Mandel: No. But you would have survived because you could survive without
having enough. So what I'm saying is -- there was a whole kind of a catalog of trades of what
was value to what point. Two cigarettes got you a haircut. A haircut got you fixed shoes. |
don't remember all of them. My friend Ladsi Loeb who was with us and has written a book
catalogues this in his book.

it would have --

>> Suzy Snyder: Not unusual because in a normal camp this would not have gone on.
>> Manny Mandel: But we were not a normal group in a normal camp.
>> Suzy Snyder: You had to barter.
>> Manny Mandel: Yes. They cared about one thing. Obviously no escapes but that we were
there for the census every day. When we arrived, we were told at dawn there would be a
census. We would be out there at dawn. The census would come immediately in three or four
or five hours.
>> Suzy Snyder: Like roll call.
>> Manny Mandel: Right. We would be out there for hours until a new commander of the
census group came and says, wait a minute, this is silly. | will be here at X time, 7:00, 8:00. |

remains be here. But it was easier to come out 15 minutes early than three, four hours early.
It probably saved lives.
>> Suzy Snyder: You're there for six months. You do leave. But in that time, did people pass
away? Did people die?
>> Manny Mandel: I'm told that several did. Not because of escapes or shootings or anything
like that. They died of what you might call natural causes.
>> Suzy Snyder: In December 1944, suddenly you're transferred. Can you talk about that?
>> Manny Mandel: Sure. In August of ‘44, 350 members of this group were, in fact, taken out
through the negotiations. | was not one of them. | stayed for the full load, until December, at

which point additional negotiations and I'm sure additional moneys and things happened. And
we were taken out not by cattle car but, in fact, by German troop trains from Bergen-Belsen
through Austria to the border of Switzerland where we got off the German train and got on
Swiss trains which were lit and warm and clean and large and hospitable. It was like another
life.
>> Suzy Snyder: Until you hit the Swiss train -- | mean, did you prepare for the worst? Was
your mother's feeling that it was another train to nowhere; you had no idea where you were
going?
>> Manny Mandel: | think they had a fairly good notion that they were being taken -- | mean
the leadership was able to say that. How they could guarantee it, | can't tell you. But | think
they had a good idea that at this time the trip will be, in fact, to Switzerland, which is where --
well, we were never designed to go to Switzerland. Designed to go to a port. At this point |
think that was the case. How they would guarantee it, | don't know.
>> Suzy Snyder: What did you do once you arrived in Switzerland? What was your daily life
like?
>> Manny Mandel: When we arrived, we were under the auspices and some of the control of
the Red Cross. The Red Cross had taken a very beautiful hotel in the French part of
Switzerland by the city, up in the mountains, and converted into a kind of a shelter for
displaced persons. We were there for several weeks. We were fed a great deal of potatoes.
None of us were starving to the point of counting -- though all of us lost weight. They wanted
to fatten us up a little bit, potatoes and butter and things like that. They had to disperse the

people because were coming in from various places as fast as they could. The people made
arrangements in Zurich, whatever the organization was, was able to take 20 children, all
Hungarian-speaking kids, and take them to a children's boarding school in the German part of
Switzerland, a place called Heiden. And | went there with 19 other kids.

By peculiar coincidence, again, guess who was the caretaker, teacher, and everything
else? My mother. Why? My mother had been a teacher when she was a young woman.
They decided they needed somebody to go with these kids who spoke Hungarian only. My
mother obviously spoke Hungarian, but she also spoke very good German, had a good
knowledge of French.

The kids there were German and Belgian kids. The staff were German, Belgian,
French. They were able to communicate and to in some way be the interlocutor needed. Also,
she ran the school. The kids were from age 6 to 14. She ran the school for each two kids |
think. But that was there. So there as the teacher's kid, it's either the best of your possible life
or the worst. If anything happened that shouldn't happen, | was blamed.
>> Suzy Snyder: Which was it?
>> Manny Mandel: Depending which day.

[Laughter]
>> Suzy Snyder: Meanwhile, the communication between your father -- you and your father,
it's non-existent.
>> Manny Mandel: Correct. My father comes back to Budapest before the war ends, before
the Russians liberated Budapest. He's looking around. He goes to this man, Dr. Kastner, the

lawyer, and says: Where is the group? Where is my family?
>> Suzy Snyder: Kastner did not travel with the train?
>> Manny Mandel: Did not. His family did.
>> Suzy Snyder: Remained in Budapest?
>> Manny Mandel: Everywhere else. He was in Switzerland when we got off the German
train, stayed a day or two and then went on to his other assignments.
Let me digress one more moment. Kastner was a very bright, incredibly arrogant guy.
There was a film made about his killing later in Israel. There was a premiere of that movie in
New York. | went to the premiere. "The New York Times" correspondent, journalist, asked me
about him. | said | never met the man. | was a child. He had no business with kids. But my
father did. Based on that description, | think | would not have liked him as a human being.
Respected what he did, but this was not a guy | wanted to have as a friend. But what he did
was something that no one else did. | mean, Schindler did something similar, but this is more
than Schindler. It's the only Jew that did anything. And there was nothing for him to gain out
of this whole issue. That's not just an opinion; it's a fact.
>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. | just would say that during this digression, | would like to point out that
what he gains is that he and his family survived.
>> Manny Mandel: Would you have an option that says -- [Inaudible]

>> Manny Mandel: That gain he has. But nothing personal in terms of anything.

>> Manny Mandel: | want to finish that thought by saying to you, you see what happens later
on is he's accused of being a collaborator of the Germans having benefited from that
collaboration. And that's what | disagree with.
>> Suzy Snyder: But he was found innocent.
>> Manny Mandel: He was never tried.
>> Suzy Snyder: There was a trial in Israel in which there was a libel suit that he brought.
>> Manny Mandel: A libel suit won.
>> Suzy Snyder: He was found that he was not libel, that it was not libel.
>> Manny Mandel: Suzy, the guy who wrote the pamphlet, the pamphlet -- writes a pamphlet
saying | accuse Kastner of being a collaborator.
>> Suzy Snyder: And Kastner brings charges.
>> Manny Mandel: He's a government employee. The government has to protect his workers
so they sue the pamphleteer who is found innocent. In the course of the trial there's such
noise about Kastner's involvement in the war, with Eichmann, with the others, he testified on
behalf of Becher in Nuremberg --
>> Suzy Snyder: Becher.
>> Manny Mandel: A German officer. The point was made that he helped the Nazis in some
way. There's much to be said about that; not here because we don't have time.
>> Suzy Snyder: Right.
>> Manny Mandel: Kastner was a person who | don't think | would like as a personal friend.

But he had to be that kind of a person to do what he did. How else could you do it?
>> Suzy Snyder: Right. We're really getting into nitty-gritty that we should get away from so
we can get back to your story, but -- and we can bring that up later if we have time in the
questions and answers. Your father did go to his office.
>> Manny Mandel: My father went to his office, found out after some difficulties which I'm not
going to elaborate on, found out where we were. And my father was able to make contact with
another cantor who was a colleague of his.

In those days cell phones didn't work very well. But you could have -- telephones
didn't work very well, there was a war going on. The war was over, but still.

The war was still on when this is taking place. We're in Switzerland but my father is
able to be in contact with my mother through his colleague, a cantor. They correspond. When
the war is over, my mother decides she wants to continue south to Palestine. My father says

Oak was the name of the group; 20 kids, boys and girls. That was the fourth grade class.
Groups were by class. And the surroundings were lovely. There were gardens. There were
not forests but orchards and others. It's a farming. It also had some dairy, milk.

Budapest, a European city?
>> Manny Mandel: Suzy, within a year or so you've gone through several languages, several
countries, adjustments become much easier. | went from Budapest to Bergen-Belsen to
Heiden to Palestine.
>> Suzy Snyder: How long were you in Palestine?

>> Manny Mandel: | think so, very much so. Very much so. Yeah. No reason -- my father
chose to stay here because he could. He had some family here. He had really very little
family in Israel. Some came after we left. But! think he made his niche here and it was very
comfortable.
>> Suzy Snyder: Your father sounds like a strong person, but reading the transcripts of your
oral history, your father's, it sounds like your mother was extremely strong, was an amazing
woman.

doesn't remember her. She died at the age of 59 unfortunately for unrelated issues. But he
knew my father very well. But point is, my mother was a very strong woman; yes. So was my
father. She had a very good life together for 37 years until she died. The only thing they ever
argued about was me.

>> Manny Mandel: That's the other. There are two major synagogues in Budapest. My father
functioned in that synagogue as well but his major, permanent position, was two blocks away.
The synagogue was not reconstructed after the war. The one that you saw was reconstructed
and most recently was refurbished as well because of some construction things they had to do
by the Emanuel Schwartz Foundation. Did you ever hear of it? Well, Emanuel Schwartz was
a tailor in Brooklyn. He had a son who was better known, Tony Curtis. They were involved in
refurbishing that. That Tony Curtis.
>> Suzy Snyder: A question up here in front. You can ask.
>> Can you clarify when you took the walk to the river? The gentleman said he recognized
part of the family. You said everybody else took a left. How did your immediate family get
saved?
>> Suzy Snyder: In Novi Sad -- this gentleman is asking for a clarification. In Novi Sad in
1941 when they had -- when there was a census, they had to walk along the river.
>> Manny Mandel: The Pogrom.
>> Suzy Snyder: The Pogrom. Manny's family was not part of it. They were rescued by this
man. Can you clarify?
>> Manny Mandel: We were marching along, and people in front of us, | don't know, 20, 30
people, whatever, made this left turn. They were the ones never seen again. At our point in
this group of probably a dozen people by this time, this policeman says you don't belong here,
step aside. Coincidental to that, within minutes, by coincidence, I'm sure, the whole Pogrom
was halted. The guy comes and announces -- nothing to do with us specifically -- announces

that the requirements of the census had been met, please go get coffee and go home. But
everybody from us back, not only us, a little before us and back, were, in fact, no longer in
danger. He recognized my father from having seen him walk on the street.

Does that clarify?
>> Yeah.
>> Suzy Snyder: Go ahead.
>> Just doing research on the Holocaust in general, “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” they
strip you down, give you these uniforms and give you the number on your wrist. Did you have
to do that, anything like that?
>> Manny Mandel: Please understand, folks -- I'll speak into it.

You have to understand, please, that the issues of the Holocaust, issues of the war,
the issues of different countries made this into a very, very multi-facetted story. Everybody did
not get uniforms; everybody was not tattooed. Nobody in Bergen-Belsen got a uniform unless
they went out to work, and we didn't. Nobody was tattooed except at Auschwitz and only if
they went to work. A number across the chest. They had a number on the arm. Sono
survivors who were in Auschwitz who have tattoos. So there were various kinds of differences.

In our situation | tried to make the point that to our fortune we had a situation whereby
we were a special group because we were the barter. We were the valuables that could not
be destroyed because then the valuables could no longer be milked for the money to generate
around the world. So we were worthless but our presence was important.
>> Suzy Snyder: | just want to clarify, in Bergen-Belsen people did arrive in striped uniforms

but usually from other camps. Often from other camps. They were deported usually to
Auschwitz and then transported to Bergen-Belsen.
>> Manny Mandel: You know the story of Anne Frank who, in fact, was deported to -- then to
Auschwitz and then to Bergen-Belsen and died there. Anne Frank came to Bergen-Belsen in
August of 1944. | came in July. | left in December. She died in April, two or three weeks
before the camp was liberated. In some way | have an odd kinship with her because for four
months we breathed the same air. But that's how people move from place to place.
>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah?
>> [Question Inaudible]
>> Suzy Snyder: The question was -- can you talk a little bit more about the bartering, the idea
of bartering people for trucks or for goods?

This was a manner in which the Jewish community -- because they had advanced
notice from Jews who had escaped from Auschwitz that Jews were being killed in Auschwitz.
And the Slovakian-Jewish community was informed of this. Eichmann and Kastner sat down
after the fact, after this, became known. And this was part of the thing. Kastner's goal was
strictly to use bartering to save lives.
>> Manny Mandel: And Eichmann's goal was to use bartering to save his life in some ways.
As | say, Eichmann and Dr. Mengele and others wind up in South America which is where the
philosophy was accepting of whatever they did. They were neutral. Neutral militarily, not
philosophically. If you think of South America in those days, Argentina, it is a country that is
fascist in its own way. They accepted these guys. They could feather their own nest. And

they could in some way make a life for themselves. By this time everybody was -- all the rats
were running out of the place any which way they could. If they had an opportunity to have
that funded in some way, they did it. There's nothing noble about it.
>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah.
>> [Question Inaudible]
>> Suzy Snyder: Was there actually an exchange of people for stuff for the war effort?
>> Manny Mandel: The original concept in the language they used was [Speaking language
other than English]. Blood for materiel. The materiel became strictly only negotiable kinds of
valuables: diamonds, gold, and so forth. No trucks. As | said, they could not raise a spare
tire; not 10,000 trucks.
>> [Inaudible]
>> Suzy Snyder: Collaborators? So the second question was: Who did the killing in 1941?
Were they German Nazis or collaborators?
>> Manny Mandel: They were not collaborators nor Naz -- they were Nazis, yes. They were
not the SS, not the German uniformed Nazis but the local Yugoslav and Hungarian troops as
well as some of the collaborating -- the Chetniks -- not -- I'm blocking on a word. The local
community people who were sympathetic to the Nazi group. It was done locally. It was not the
only one. There were many.
>> Suzy Snyder: And in Hungary it was the Arrow Cross.

Serbia is not all of it because southern Hungary. But they were not in Hungary. That's the
important point for us. Not only invaded, not taken over. Austria, yes. France, yes. So forth
and so on.
>> Suzy Snyder: Right. And Czechoslovakia.
>> Manny Mandel: Right.
>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah?
>> [Question Inaudible]
>> Manny Mandel: Honestly, they count enough people.
>> Suzy Snyder: Manny said the needs of the census were met. What needs were met?
>> Manny Mandel: As | said, | don't know what the needs were in the first place. They count
enough people or they count enough sections of the city that produced the people to know how
many men, women, children, whatever there were. Whatever they were looking for.
Remember, there was no census involved in this. This was a Pogrom collecting
people. The ruse was we have to have a census so come outside. But the fact is what
happened is march us to death except we didn't quite get there. Ok?

Manny or Manny's family realize that their lives were saved, that the other people were being
killed? I'm throwing that part in because | gather that -- go ahead and answer the question.
>> Manny Mandel: | had no idea whatsoever as to what was happening. /-year-old kids were
not privy to some of this stuff nor could they understand it. And | would not be surprised if my
parents decided to just hold it back. They found out that night. My aunt’s in-laws were killed.
They found out through telephone conversations and what not what was going on, which is
why my father the next morning ordered the taxi at 6:00 in the morning, which | thought was
another adventure. This was a one-horse power taxi. You ever hear of one? It was winter.
There was snow. The taxi was a sleigh. One horse.
>> Suzy Snyder: Was this the last time you saw your mother's family?
>> Manny Mandel: No. We saw them subsequently in Budapest. The point is it -- go ahead.
>> Suzy Snyder: No. Go ahead.
>> Manny Mandel: We were talking about when | found out. | don't know when | found out. |

of its meaning, | don't know. | can't give you a time as to on Tuesday | understood what was
happening. | began to understand there were people being killed in various places. And this
was the first experience | had with it. Almost.
>> Suzy Snyder: It's our tradition to let Manny have the last word. I'm going to let him do that.
Then what | would ask you to do is if you could, once Manny is done, if you could please just
rise in your seats and stay standing so that Miriam can take a picture of Manny with you as the

Manny?
>> Manny Mandel: | often, maybe all the time, when | make talks of this nature, here or
elsewhere, | talk about a person whose name you don't remember but his words you do
remember. | will leave that with you.

A man said those who do not learn the history well may be doomed to repeat it or
repeat parts of it. The man's name was George Santayana, 120 years ago. Point is not so
much that you need to be concerned there's going to be a Holocaust here next week. But
there are other kinds of things that we do to each other. What man does to man is
indescribable. Those are not my own words. They were spoken by then General Eisenhower.

The point I'm making is that | would beseech you and leave the last word with you to
see to it that by being here this is not the last nor the first of your experience in learning about
what man does to man: Holocaust, Second World War, why these, why those, and why not.
That's the only way you're going to know what to do in that we can learn nothing from the
future but we can learn from the past which you can apply in the future.
