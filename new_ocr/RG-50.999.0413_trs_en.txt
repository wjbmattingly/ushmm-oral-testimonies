>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's
public program, First Person. Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 14th
year of First Person. Our First Person today is Mrs. Josie Traum, whom we shall
meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity
of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again
sponsoring First Person.

First Person \s a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust
who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the
Holocaust. Each guest serves as a volunteer here at this museum.

We will continue our program through mid August. The museum's
website, at www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming
First Person guests.

Josie Traum will share with us her First Person account of her experience
during the Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at
the end of the program, we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Josie a few
questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you
are about to hear from Josie is one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction.

We begin with this portrait of Josiane Aizenberg walking on a street in
Brussels. Josie was born March 21, 1939 in Brussels, Belgium, to Jacques and
Fanny Aizenberg. The arrow points to Brussels.

The German army conquered Belgium in May of 1940. Shortly before the
occupation, Josie's father left Belgium to join the British Army. In this photo, we
see Josie with her parents in Brussels.

In 1942, Josie's mother Fanny was able to secure a hiding place for Josie
in a convent in Bruges, Belgium. Here we see Josie and Fanny shortly before
Josie went into hiding. Soon thereafter, Fanny, who worked with the Belgian
underground, or the resistance, was denounced and she was deported to
Auschwitz.

After six months of hiding in a convent and growing Nazi suspicion, the
Belgian underground relocated Josie to hide with the Debrackelaers, a Christian
family in Brussels. Here we see Josie with the Debrackelaers. Josie is in the
front, on your right, right here. Behind her are the Debrackelaers. The couple to
their left are friends of Josie's grandparents, who were neighbors of the
Debrackelaers, and the little girl standing in front of the neighbors is the
Debrackelaers' daughter. | think their son is standing right between the two girls
in the front row.

Allied forces liberated Belgium in September 1944. Soon after, Josie was

found by one of her aunts, Fanny, her mother's sister. Here we see Josie,
Jacques and Fanny after they were reunited in the United States.

Josie would eventually marry Freddie Traum, also a Holocaust
survivor. We close our PowerPoint presentation with this wedding portrait of
Josie and Freddie.

After moving to the United States with her parents in 1949, and then
completing her schooling in Paterson, New Jersey, Josie went to Israel to study
for a year. On the return trip, on a ship, she met Freddie Traum, the ship's chief
radio officer. Upon her return to the US, Josie attended Montclair State
Teachers’ College for one year. Josie and Freddie were married on a ship a year
after she met him, and she moved to Israel where they lived for five years. While
in Israel, the Traums' son Michael and daughter Yael were born.

Upon the advice of medical experts in Israel, the Traums relocated to the
United States in 1963 to obtain medical care for their disabled son, Michael.
Their third child, Jonathan, who is also disabled, was born in the United States.
Eventually, Freddie's work brought them to Vienna, Virginia. Josie returned to
school and graduated from the Catholic University of America School of Social
Work and began her career in child welfare. She retired in 2008 from her work
as a Clinical social worker for abused children in Montgomery County, Maryland.

Today, Josie and Freddie live in Silver Spring, Maryland. Josie's volunteer
work at this museum includes leading tours of the permanent exhibition for law

enforcement, including police officers, the FBI, judges and others. She also
volunteers with Visitor Services.

Josie has only recently started speaking publicly about her
experience as a Holocaust survivor. She now speaks at local synagogues and
schools, such as Christian Academy and Walter Johnson High School in
Montgomery County, Maryland. In February, she spoke to grades 1-8 at Legacy
School in Carroll County, Maryland, which one of my sons attend. Next week,
Josie and Freddie will soeak at the Montgomery College next week as part of the
college's commemoration of the Holocaust.

And, as part of the Holocaust Days of Remembrance next week, Josie will
join others in reading aloud here in the museum the names of those killed during
the Holocaust. Josie will read the names of 100 victims. Anyone can sign up to
read names of survivors for five minutes, by going to the website, if you are here
or available. Freddie is also with us today. If you wouldn't mind waving, so
people know you're here.

With that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person,
Mrs. Josie Traum.

[Applause]

Josie, thank you so much for joining us today. Just such a pleasure to
have you with us. We have a very large crowd today. We should probably start.
We have so much to cover in a short period.

Your parents, Fanny and Jacques Aizenberg, were married in early
1938, and you were born the following March 1939. Just months before
Germany and Russia attacked Poland, launching World War II. Tell us about
your parents and their life in Brussels prior to war beginning. What was their life
like?
>> Josie Traum: OK. First of all, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm so glad there's a
full audience. Thank you for coming in.

My parents led a pretty, | guess, newlyweds' life. Both my parents were in
the textile and dressmaking and sewing industry. My mother had graduated from
technical design art school, and she became a dressmaker and a pattern
designer, and she actually worked for the royal family, which was a real big deal
at that time.

My dad was a tailor. However, before he became a tailor, he used to be a
violinist. Many, many years ago, I'm sure way, way before any of your times,
there used to be movies that were silent. Because they were silent movies, they
used to have a quartet, an orchestra playing music while the film was being
shown. Once the talkies came, once the films became talking, like they are
today, my dad lost his job. They didn't need musicians anymore in all of the
movie houses. So he went to school, and actually learned to be a tailor.

So both my parents were involved in clothes making, and they were

married, and as newlyweds | was born about a year and a half later. So | think
they were a young couple with just me coming around.
>> Bill Benson: Josie, do you know whether or not -- from what they said to you
later, that they were married in 1938, later that year in November, of course,
things became even more ominous in Nazi Germany with Kristallnacht, and you
came along in March 1939. There were war clouds, September the war would
begin. Do you think your parents were fearful about the future at that time, when
you were born?
>> Josie Traum: | think they really were. At the time, there were rumors in
Belgium that when the Germans would invade, it was said, they would leave the
women and children alone, and only arrest the men. So therefore, there are
always Calls on the radio asking people to volunteer for the army.

My dad and his brother heard the calls from the British to come on over,
cross the channel and join the British Army. So my dad and his brother, who
were both tailors, actually took one of the last ships across the channel in 1940,
and came to England to volunteer for the British Army.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to take you back for just a moment before we continue
from there, Josie. As a result of Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, in
November 1938, didn't your parents take in for shelter a Jewish child, for a
period?

>> Josie Traum: They did. Jews were running away from many of the eastern
European countries, from Poland, Czechoslovakia, trying to find a safer place to
be. So my mom -- actually, both my parents and grandparents took in people
who would stay with them for a few days till they would find a safer place,
perhaps crossing a border in another country. So there was always a lot of
movement in our apartment.
>> Bill Benson: Before we come back to the war itself, | just have to ask you to
explain how you got your name, Josiane.
>> Josie Traum: My real name is Josiane. It's named for a French singer. My
mother adored that name. She thought it was marvelous. Here | was given that
very special name. When | came to this country as a little girl, nobody could say
Josiane. And so | became a Josie. So here | am, | come to you as Josie.
>> Bill Benson: The Germans, of course, attacked Belgium and France in May
1940. As you explained, with war looking like it was going to come to Belgium,
your father responded to the call from the British to go to England to fight for
them. As you say, he made it away from Dunkirk. Can you tell us more about
Dunkirk?
>> Josie Traum: No, | can't.
>> Bill Benson: There were, | think, several ships --

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,
>> Josie Traum: | see what you're saying. I'm sorry. Only a couple ships made
it. Many were torpedoed by the Germans. My dad, being on the ship, made it
across the channel, got to England.
>> Bill Benson: Did your mother know that?
>> Josie Traum: She did not.
>> Bill Benson: The last she saw, he was going off to England --
>> Josie Traum: Not knowing what would happen to him.
>> Bill Benson: With him gone, it's you and your mom. What happened then?
>> Josie Traum: My mom and | were living together, with my maternal
grandparents, my mother's parents, and we lived very much together in an
apartment, hiding. Pretty much in hiding. When the Germans came, you had to
have an identity card identifying if you were a Jew. If you were a Jew, when you
were walking on the street, a German would stop you and say, "Show me your
identification card." Of course, if they saw you were Jewish, they might arrest
you, deport you, or you really didn't know what was going to happen.
>> Bill Benson: What about your grandparents? Both sets of grandparents, |
believe, were still alive at that time?
>> Josie Traum: My father's parents, my grandfather actually died before | was
born. My grandmother from my father's side died once the war began, and it was
not war-related. Both my paternal grandparents died. My maternal
grandparents, we lived with them, pretty much in hiding together with them.

>> Bill Benson: Your maternal grandmother worked at a place for the homeless
at that time?
>> Josie Traum: It was a society that took care of people to make sure they had
food. It was like a Jewish kind of community, society. She would -- because of
that, she would sometimes get a little bit of food for us. At that time, in Belgium,
food was rationed. You only got certain rations once a week. You would pick up
the food, and that's really all you would have.
>> Bill Benson: At one point, your grandfather was arrested, wasn't he?
>> Josie Traum: My grandfather was arrested, and he was taken to one of these
gathering camps called Malin, or Mecaline. The Jews -- actually, the prisoners
would be gathered until they had enough of them, then they would deport them
by railroad cars to the concentration camps. So my grandfather was actually
taken before my grandmother and mother.
>> Bill Benson: Now it's the three of you, your mother and grandmother.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: How did they make ends meet?
>> Josie Traum: My grandmother worked, not only for the Jewish community,
but she also worked what we call hada kaddisha. When a Jewish person dies,
you are taken care of; they make sure you have a proper burial, and they watch
over you. So my grandmother was very involved, where the Jewish community,

people who were dying, she would get food from them. Really, we did with
whatever little we could get.
>> Bill Benson: If | remember right, you were telling me that all healthcare was
cut off?
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Here you are, a young child, the clinics and everything were
closed to you just because you were Jewish.
>> Josie Traum: Exactly. All of those things were controlled by the Germans,
and they were of course closed, so | was not able to go.

When you're a newborn, you go to a special clinic --
>> Bill Benson: Like a well baby clinic?
>> Josie Traum: A well baby clinic, a few times a month, to make sure you're
gaining the right weight, getting the shots you need. All of that was closed. | was
pretty much on my own with my mom and grandmother.
>> Bill Benson: As you were saying a few moments ago, Josie, you had
identification cards, and you never knew what would happen. You describe to
me one of your early memories, because you were so young, but you do have an
early memory of an incident on a bus.
>> Josie Traum: | do. | remember sitting on a bus, it was before my third
birthday. | was really still a little one. My mother and | were riding the bus, public
transportation, and a German officer, Nazi, came on the bus, and what they

would do, they would go from row to row and ask for your identification card. You
had to show it to them, of course.

| remember sitting next to my mom, who was very, very scared, and |
didn't understand why, and | was only 3 years old, not even 3. Anyhow, the
German came from row to row, asking for the ID cards. All the passengers on
the tram actually would give him the card, and he would read it and give it back.
He got to the last row where my mom and | were sitting, and for some
reason he turned around and left the tram, so he never came, he never actually
asked my mom for identity cards, which is obviously pretty lucky. | think
somebody must have been looking over.
>> Bill Benson: A stroke of luck.
>> Josie Traum: Justa stroke of luck. My mother was shaking. | really didn't
understand why.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother got active in the resistance, the underground, which
had to be just an extraordinarily brave thing to do.
>> Josie Traum: Right.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what you know about that.
>> Josie Traum: OK. At that time, of course, | didn't understand what was going
on.
>> Bill Benson: Right, right.

>> Josie Traum: My mother was hiding people in our apartment. We always had
people there hiding till they found a better place to go. She would also deliver
newsletters, leaflets for meetings for where the underground, or resistance
against the Germans would be meeting. So she was busy with all of these
things, and my understanding is she was very involved with that. Because of
that, she wanted to make sure that | would be safe. She actually got in touch
with the underground and made sure that somebody would pick me up and place
me in hiding.
>> Bill Benson: That was one of the real motivators -- a real motivator was in
1942 the Nazis began earnest efforts deporting the Jews.
>> Josie Traum: Right. In 1942 the deportations began. They started gathering
Jews, deporting them mainly to Auschwitz. My mother wanted to make sure |
would be safe, so one day, 1942 | was 3 years old, and two strange ladies came
to pick me up. They actually picked me up. My mother, by the way, was not
allowed to know where they were taking me, because they knew when the
Germans would come to deport you, to arrest you, they would beat you till you
would tell them where the rest of the family was.

So my mother, these two strange ladies came to pick me up, and my
mother was not allowed to know where they were taking me. They took me to a
convent in Bruges, a beautiful little city near Belgium, near canals. It's really
beautiful, lots of convents.

| was taken to a convent, very much like an orphanage. In those days,
when people couldn't take care of their kids or didn't have enough food and the
war was going on, people would put their kids in a convent, which was like an
orphanage. When the parents could, were able to manage and take care of
them, they would pick up the children.

So this convent was full of kids, and unbeknownst to me there were three
other Jewish children there being hidden. So there were four Jewish kids hidden
in this convent.
>> Bill Benson: Along with many other non-Jewish kids?
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Josie, has your mother had the opportunity to tell you what it was
like for her to actually put you into hiding to an unknown place, not knowing when
and if she would see you again? That was a huge decision for her to make.
>> Josie Traum: It was a huge decision. It must have been so difficult. | think to
myself now, my grandchildren, | don't think I'd be able to just give them up and
not know where they were going.

Obviously, my mother made the sacrifice in deciding to take a chance and
have me be safe, and even though she didn't know where | was going. Indeed,
she really didn't know. One important thing to remember in Belgium, in most of
Europe, if you were hiding a Jew and the Germans would find you they would just
shoot you. No questions asked. They would just shoot you.

So the nuns who hid me were really risking their lives. They were really
taking a chance.

the arrangements for you to go, or just her connections in the underground?

ladies to pick me up. | left. | didn't see my mother again till the end of the war.
>> Bill Benson: Right. Right. You were in the convent, | think for about six
months. What do you remember? Again, Knowing how little you were. Do you
recall anything of your life there?
>> Josie Traum: The nuns were very strict. But my understanding, it's not
because -- they were very strict with me. They were strict with all of the kids, not
just because | was Jewish. | have spoken to many people who have gone to
Catholic school with nuns, they said, "oh, yeah."
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: They get it.
>> Josie Traum: They getit. They were really, really strict. But they saved my
life. What can | say? One thing | do remember about the nuns, this shocked me
more than anything else, we slept in big dorms, and the nuns in those days wore
very stiff habits like you see in "The Sound of Music," very stiff, very tight around
here. The nuns at night would take off their headgear to go to sleep. They would
sleep with us in the rooms.

>> Bill Benson: You were saying they were strict, but not just in the sense of
don't do this, don't do that. You told me about, not an incident, you were a finicky
eater, | believe you said. How did they handle finicky-eating kids?
>> Josie Traum: | remember throwing up, and they would let me stay in bed in
my throw-up, which is pretty horrible. They would also put me in a closet to
punish me and say the devil would come and get me. But here again, it's not
because | was a Jew. This is how they were with all of the kids. | happened to
have been a very finicky eater. My mother used to play into it. | survived,
though.
>> Bill Benson: You had to, of course, have a different name while you were
there. Tell us about the name that you were given.
>> Josie Traum: Belgium has two languages, two different ethnic groups. They
speak Flemish and French. Sol was given a Flemish name. My first name was
the same, Josiane, but instead of Aizenberg, a very Jewish German name, they

gave me the name of Van Berg, a very Dutch name, very Flemish name. So my
name did change. They gave me a different name.
>> Bill Benson: You explained to me one time that, you told me what you
thought was the most significant impact on you personally while you were in the
convent. Do you remember talking about it? It was -- the impact was just the
lack of nurturing. Will you say a little bit about that?
>> Josie Traum: This is where my tears come. | strongly, strongly believe, with
all of the social work I've done and with the psychology and child development,
and what I've really read, | really learned that the first three years in a child's
development are the most important, as far as bonding with the caretaker, not
necessarily a parent, but a person who takes care of the child, a caretaker that
you learn to trust and you bond with.

| must say that my first three years were with my mother, and | bonded
with her, and | really felt nurtured and loved. So | feel whatever happened
afterwards, being in the convent, having a pretty difficult time, | really feel that |
kind of basically relied on those first three years of bonding and nurturing with my
mother, and | think they made me strong as a person, as a child.
>> Bill Benson: | Know that's hard to talk about, so thank you for that. Josie,
after about six months in the convent, the nuns made the decision to move you
out of there. Will you tell us wnat you know about that?

>> Josie Traum: My understanding is that the nuns found out that the Germans
were going to come and pick up the four Jewish children, the other three and me.
So by night, the nuns smuggled me out of the convent and took me back to
Brussels, which is where | was originally from. There, they placed me, they must
have had connections with the underground, they placed me with a Christian
family in Brussels. You saw the picture of the Debrackelaers. | was with them
the remainder of the war. It was a mother, a father, and a little girl. And | pretty
much stayed with them for the entire duration of the war.
>> Bill Benson: Almost two full years?
>> Josie Traum: Two full years. And the father, Mr. Debrackelaer, was involved
with the resistance, in the underground movement. Very often, he would be
taken out during the day and questioned and interrogated, but he never told them
that | was there.

He used to actually work in the underground against the Germans, as a
Christian, which many Christians did. So | was very, very lucky they kept me.
They kept me safe, and they risked their lives. Because, here again, had the
Germans known that they were hiding me, they would have been shot.

Also, as | mentioned before, food was rationed in Belgium, and because
they were a family of three, mother, father and child, they would pick up food for
a week in rations, and | was not listed there, because | was there illegally. So
they actually got food for three people and shared it with me.

Mr. Debrackelaer, whenever he was interrogated, never told them that |
was there, and actually | remained safe there for the entire duration of the war.
>> Bill Benson: What can you tell us, what do you remember, again knowing
how young you were, what life was like living with them? | presume to neighbors
you must have been a relative that came in.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: What life was like for you during that time.
>> Josie Traum: | kept very much to my -- well, not I, the family kept very much
to themselves. We stayed indoors. | played with the little girl. And our life was
very much limited. The family took a risk. They saved my life, which I'm forever
grateful for.
>> Bill Benson: During that time do you remember what kind of setting? Did
they live in the city, outside?
>> Josie Traum: They were in Brussels, a little outside the city, in Brussels. We
were in a main floor, as you come in, it was the main floor. And there was a
bedroom where we -- actually, the parents slept in one bedroom and the little girl
and | slept in another bedroom. We played, and we were very much to
ourselves.
>> Bill Benson: And do you know if neighbors knew you were there?

while to my grandparents. You saw the picture, of the Debrackelaers with my
grandparents’ neighbors. So sometimes | would meet with them, and | would be
with them, but aside from that, we really kept to ourselves.
>> Bill Benson: The war ended for Belgium, not elsewhere in Europe but for
Belgium, in the fall, | believe, of 1944.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: You were liberated with the Debrackelaers and others. One of
your aunts found you. Tell us what you know about that, and then what
happened from there.
>> Josie Traum: My mom had two sisters, my two aunts, and they were also, by
the way, during the war hidden through the underground. They were all hidden in
churches. They actually remained in churches for the entire duration of the war.
>> Bill Benson: Actually in the church?
>> Josie Traum: In the church. They stayed there. One aunt had three boys
and her husband, and they all stayed in the church, and all survived, all remained
alive.

What | forgot to mention before, by the way, my mother, very soon after |
was taken away to the convent, my mother was deported to Auschwitz. She and
her mother were deported. My grandfather had already been deported to
Auschwitz. So my grandparents did not survive. However, my mother did. And

what | do want to mention, my two aunts really were saved through the
underground, through churches. Because there was a whole network in the
underground, my aunt knew where to find me. There was like a network you
could find people who were also hidden.

So my aunt found me, and very soon after that wnen she found me she
brought me to her house. And | stayed there till my mother eventually came
back.
>> Bill Benson: Which would be later, in 1945. You were with your Aunt Theresa
quite a while.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Do you remember any of that time?
>> Josie Traum: They treated me like their pet. She had three sons. They were
all older than me. She treated me like a little mascot.

[Laughter]
They spoiled me rotten. They were wonderful to me. They were really terrific.
My mother had been deported to Auschwitz, and she survived.
>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to that, if that's OK, tell us a little bit about your
aunt's husband, your uncle.
>> Josie Traum: Yes. His name was Maurice. He was a very quiet, shy, meek
man. And after the war, we found out he got special honors for killing Germans.
He apparently was part of the underground, and none of us could believe it. |

was a little girl, | didn't understand very much, but my mom and her two sisters
could not believe that Maurice was able to do this.

He actually went in the underground and attacked Germans and helped
Jews as much as he could, and he got a special award, which was amazing to
me.
>> Bill Benson: What about your other aunt?
>> Josie Traum: My other aunt was younger. There were three sisters, my
mom, her younger sister, each is five years apart. My younger aunt was quite a
bit younger. She worked. She was also in a church. She worked -- also, when
the Americans came, she started working actually with the Americans.
>> Bill Benson: War would continue in Europe until May of 1945, so a lot longer.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if there was fear the Germans might come back, or
did everybody at that point, do you think they felt really free and liberated?
>> Josie Traum: | think Belgium felt liberated. The Americans and the allies had
liberated Belgium, and | think we felt cautious, but very safe. | felt safe, certainly,
as a child. | was with my two aunts. | felt safe with my three cousins. So | felt
very safe being with them.

resume their lives, and food?

aunt took me in. | was just part of the family.
>> Bill Benson: It must have seemed like a miracle that your mother was able to
survive and return in April of 1945, after she was liberated.
>> Josie Traum: Absolutely. You know, my mother and her mother were
deported at the same time. They were arrested.
>> Bill Benson: Somebody denounced them, didn't they?
>> Josie Traum: We talk about wonderful people in Belgium, the churches, the
nuns. There were so many wonderful people. But there were many people who
denounced Jews, who would get money for telling the Germans where the Jews
lived.

So | was saved, really, by many, many people. However, neighbors
denounced my mom, said where she lived, and they found her, and they arrested
her and deported her, her and my grandmother.

So my mother was taken to Auschwitz. My grandfather, by the way, died
before he got to Auschwitz. He died on one of the cattle cars, on the way to
Auschwitz.

My mother and grandmother, as soon as they got to Auschwitz, they had a
selection where they put people who were healthier and younger in one line and

people who were a little bit elderly, like my grandmother, who must have been in
her late 40s.

Most concentration camps, you got there, they killed you. Auschwitz
had a subcamp, which was a labor camp. It was called Birkenau. So they
actually would put people who were younger, more healthy looking, onto the
labor camp. So my mother and her mother were separated immediately, as soon
as they got to Auschwitz. And my mother went to run to be with her mother, and
the German really hit her hard and said, "You go where you're told." She actually
never saw her mother again.

So, luckily, my mother survived, and my grandparents did not.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like for you to have your mother come back?
>> Josie Traum: Well, first of all, my mother was very, very sick when she was
liberated. She was liberated by the Russians. Different concentration camps
were liberated by different armies. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviets, by
the Soviet Union. So when she was liberated, she was taken to a hospital by the
Russians. She was pretty sick. She had typhus and meningitis, and eventually
the Red Cross brought her back down to Belgium. And she got back to Belgium,
the first place she went was her sister's house. She knocked on the door, and
there | was. So we were reunited.
>> Bill Benson: Up until that point, she probably had no idea you were there,
none whatsoever.

>> Josie Traum: No. She had no idea. And | didn't know about her.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother's experience was just beyond description what she
went through. She was very ill wnen she came back. At what point was she able
to begin to really take care of you?
>> Josie Traum: Well, | think probably very soon, even though she was sick, she
really did take care of me. My dad didn't come back from England until 1946, a
year after the war. Where he was living in England, a bomb fell on his house and
he was in a hospital for two years. So he really couldn't come back until he was
healed. He did come back in 1946, and of course, | didn't remember him
because | was 13 months old when he left. | was 7 years old when he came
back. So it was really like meeting up with a stranger. For my mom, too, | think.
They, all three of us, had very different experiences, and | think it took a while, a
long, long while to become used to each other again.
>> Bill Benson: Your father came back in 1946, so better part of a year after your
mom got back. What was -- do you know what life was like for her to re-establish
her own life, without your father for that year period, and with you? What was
that time like?
>> Josie Traum: Well, first of all, | started going to school. | was too young, |
couldn't go to school anyhow during the war. | started going to school, and | had
some kind of regularity and schedule to my life.
My mom, | think, tried to establish herself. We had a store. The

apartment house we lived in had a store on the bottom floor. My dad used to
have a shop there, which he opened again when he came back. My mother
started working a little bit with dressmaking, and | think she relied a lot on her
sister.

Eventually, our life became somewhat normal. Once my dad came back,
my parents both felt they really wanted to leave Europe, and they wanted to
come to the United States. So they applied for visas and papers, and in 1949 we
actually -- | was 10 years old, in 1949 we came to this country.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that more, I'm going to take you back a
little bit. You remember actually waiting for your father when he disembarked.
Tell us about that, because that's one of your real memories. But also a little bit
about what happened to him, up until the time he came back. I'm not sure what
point your mother knew he was alive. What happened during his time?
>> Josie Traum: During his time, first of all, | think | mentioned the British when
he came to volunteer in England, he volunteered in a factory making British
uniforms, he and his brother were making British uniforms. Once he was injured
>> Bill Benson: From the bomb that fell on the house?
>> Josie Traum: When the bomb fell on his house, we pretty much lost contact.
He had been writing to my mother at the end of the war.
>> Bill Benson: After the end of the war, OK.

>> Josie Traum: 1945, he was writing to my mother. But prior to that, we really,
there was no contact whatsoever. My mother didn't know if he was alive, and he
didn't know if we were alive. So it was purely by stroke of great luck that we were
reunited.

My father came back. There's a port, Astand in Belgium, where the ships
come in, it's a port city. My dad came back from England, and my mom and |
went to wait for him at the port. We saw him coming down the gangplank, and
my mother of course knew immediately who he was. She said, "There's your
father." Of course, to me he was a total stranger. | was 7 years old. This was a
man | don't remember, because he left when | was so young. That's how | first
met him.
>> Bill Benson: You would live together as a family for three years before you
came to the United States. What was that period like?
>> Josie Traum: | think it was very difficult. It was a lot of readjustment and
adjustment for all of us. My mother had gone through hell, really, and so had my
father, in a different way. My mother had lost her parents, she had lost much of
her family, and it was very, very hard. It was a hard adjustment.

| remember -- | remember my mother having nightmares and crying and
screaming during the night. So it was very, very hard for my parents to become
readjusted to each other, not just to each other but then to me. It was like, ina
way, three people with totally different experiences

States. Tell us about that.

lived in Paterson, New Jersey. One usually gravitates where you have a relative.
We lived with my mother's aunt about a month, till my parents found an
apartment. They both found jobs. And we were pretty much on our own.

My parents were really working very, very quickly once we did come to the
United States. But adjustment was very hard.

They put me -- | was 10 years old. They put me in the first grade, because
they thought if | don't soeak English, you know, first grade is fine.

>> Bill Benson: They were convinced you could actually go on grade, yes.
>> Josie Traum: Yes. Then | spoke English. It's interesting, when you're a kid,
you really pick up the language very quickly. My parents were very emphatic. At
home we would speak French, but when | came home from school | would speak
English to them, because they really wanted me to. As soon as we got to this
country, to New Jersey, they registered in high school because they wanted to
learn English, they wanted to learn history, they wanted to become Americans.
So | spoke English to them when | came home.

By the way, Bill did not mention, my mother is still alive. She's 96. Which
is incredible.

three sons, remained in Belgium for a number of years, then they all moved to
Israel. My younger aunt, five years younger than my mom, eventually came to
the United States and lived in New York. They both have died, but not war

know that you were in the convent? Did they have some kind of connections?
Because, you said they knew, they were coming for the four children. How did
they know you were there?
>> Bill Benson: In case the folks in the back didn't hear, the question is when
Josie was in the convent and the nuns had information that it was going to be
raided, how did they know that?

>> Josie Traum: First, the Germans were very organized. All the Jews in
Belgium and in most European countries were actually registered in the
synagogues, in the Jewish community centers. The Germans really knew where
most of the Jews lived.

They also had a lot of inside information. They knew that convents and
nuns and Christian people were hiding Jews. So whether they had people
working with them, people denouncing for money, for whatever reasons, but they
knew there were Jewish kids being hidden in the convent.
>> Bill Benson: Periodically, probably had raids and must have known that one

hiding. Didn't know what it was like not to be in hiding. So as a child, you don't
question those things as much as you do an adult.

| think you'd get a different answer if you asked my mom what kept her
going and what kept the adults going.
>> Bill Benson: One of the things | recall you saying to me the first time | talked
to you about this, Josie, you said when the war ended, there you were with your
aunt, your words were "| was just a child who really needed to be held." Yeah.
OK.

We have right back there. No, back here, then to you with the mic. OK.
>> Can you hear me? Josie, you mentioned that your mother was deported to
Auschwitz.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> From there, she went to a subcamp for labor, Birkenau.
>> Josie Traum: Yes.
>> What type of labor did she do there?
>> Josie Traum: Actually, she went daily to Birkenau. They would take the
prisoners daily, then back to Auschwitz. She was working in an ammunition
factory. She was filling grenades and bombs.
>> Bill Benson: Exceptionally, exceptionally brutal circumstances. She tells me
that her eyebrows and eyelashes burned off and would turn yellow because of
the chemicals. It was pretty hard.

>> Bill Benson: OK. A question right here. A mic coming to you.
>> Josie, thank you so much. I'd like to ask you a question that I've asked some
other survivors, and that is maybe for you and for your other family members,
could you tell me maybe would you say that with your experiences and your
mother's experiences, has this all been a God-affirming experience for you or a
God-denying experience for you?
>> Bill Benson: The question, if you didn't hear in the back, is really the impact
from a religious perspective for you, if | can put it that way.
>> Yes.
>> Josie Traum: That's a very hard question. Right now, I'm an observant
person and | believe in God. There are too many good things and wonderful
things that are happening in this world to make me feel that there is a God. Many
people, after the Holocaust, had a very difficult time believing in God. You know,
how could this have all happened if there was a God?

| don't know. | feel that | do believe in God, and | am observant, to some
extent, traditionally as a Jew. And | think it's made me a strong person.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. Thank you. We have one right in the middle here,
then one over there. Let's do the middle right here. The mic is coming from your
other side. There you go. Thanks, Kristin.
>> Hi, Josie. | was wondering, when did your mom start talking to you about her

experiences in Auschwitz? What was it like for you, when you first heard it, what
your mom went through in Auschwitz?
>> Bill Benson: Did you hear that OK?
>> Josie Traum: | did. Actually, she did not start speaking to me for many, many
years after that. As | mentioned before, | remember during the night her having
nightmares, and running through the apartment screaming and crying, and |
didn't quite understand many of the things she was going through. As a child, |
couldn't understand, because | myself was having a difficult time readjusting to
life and to everything else.

| Know she tried to speak to some relatives, and they didn't want to hear
her. They would actually say, "We don't want to hear about that. That was in the
past, and that's bad. Things are different now."

So my mom actually didn't talk for a long, long time, for many years. In
fact, | think she only really started talking about her history in the -- when she was
90 years old. Here, | would think, | think it's because of the museum. It gave her
a place that she could actually talk and feel comfortable about talking. But |, she
didn't -- what | did, | did a lot of reading when | was very young, and | read as
much as | could, from different experiences from Eli Wiesel, from different people
that have gone through the Holocaust, and | kind of surmised what she had gone
through. Little by little she tells us.

>> Thank you. Your story is heart-rending. It's wonderful. Thank you for sharing
your story.
>> Josie Traum: Thank you.
>> My question is, we hear much about the scars of the children and
grandchildren of the Holocaust survivors. In your years of social work, | wonder if
you might tell us a little more about what the scars are, and how serious are they
for the children and grandchildren of the survivors?
>> Bill Benson: Does that -- OK.
>> Josie Traum: Yeah. That's a very, very big question. First of all, let me tell
you, | can tell you about my experience or how | feel. | am not only a child of a
survivor, but I'm a survivor myself. So | have like a double whammy. And
because of that, | think I've been very, very overprotective with my children.

| am so worried that something might happen, even though they might be
very, very safe. But | think children do have a lot of scars. I've heard children
say, who are now adults, whose parents made them be safe and let them go
away, or made them go away, and those children are angry because they were
given away, not realizing that the parents, how hard it was for the parents to give
up the children for them to be safe.

So there are scars, | think, that are brought from generation to generation.
There really are.

by Martin Niemoller, a Lutheran minister, and it says, "First they came for the
