Bill Benson: Good morning, and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First
Person. Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 18th year of First Person. Our First
Person today is Mrs. Rae Goldfarb, whom you shall meet shortly.

This 2017 season of First Person is made possible Through the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher
Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person
guests serves as volunteers here at this museum. Our program will continue twice-weekly
until mid-August. The museum's website, at www.ushmm.org provides information about each
of our upcoming First Person guests.

Rae will share with us her First Person account of her experience during the Holocaust
and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at tend of the program, we'll have an
opportunity for you to ask Rae some questions. Today's program will be live streamed on the
museum's website. This means people will be joining the program via a link from the
museum's website and watching with us today from across the country and around the world.
Recordings of all First Person programs will be made available on the museum's YouTube
page. Weare also accepting questions from our web audience today on Twitter. Please use
the hashtag USHMM. USHMM. And we invite those who are here in the auditorium today to
also join us on the web whether the rest of our programs in April and early May will be live
streamed. Please visit the First Person website listed on the back of your program for more
details. The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to
hear from Rae is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide
presentation to help with her introduction.

Rachel Mutterperl was born to Beryl and Dina Mutterperl on December 2, 1930, in
Dokszyce, Poland, which is now in Belarus. This photo is of Rae, who is on the left, her
mother, Dina, in the middle, and her brother Shlomo on the right.

On this map of Poland the arrow indicates the location of Dokszyce. As part of an
agreement with Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union occupied Dokszyce in September 1939.

Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. When German SS and police began mass killings
of Ray's brother was discovered by Germans and killed. Rae and her mother sought shelter
in the ghetto in Glebokie, a town North of Dokszyce. The second arrow points to Glebokie.

Here we see a synagogue in the Glebokie ghetto. Rae's mother joined a group of
partisans in the forest outside of Glebokie and became their cook with Rae as her assistant.

In the late summer of 1944, Dina and Rae marched with partisans to the Soviet lines where
they were liberated.

After liberation, Rae and Dina left Poland for Italy where they stayed in the Santa
Cesarea Displaced Persons Camp. The arrow points to the location of the Santa Ceseara
Displaced Persons Camp, as you can see, in the lower boot of Italy. Here we see Rae and
her mother in the Santa Cesarea Displaced Persons' Camp.

In 1947, Rae and her mother immigrated to the United States with sponsorship and
support from an aunt who had settled there previously. These pictures show Rae's official Red
Cross identification documents.

After arriving in the US in November 1947, Rae and her mother came to Washington,
DC but later moved to Brooklyn where Rae finished high school. Rae went to work for the
Washington, DC court system after graduating from high school and attended George
Washington University and Baltimore Hebrew College at night. Rae married Harry Goldfarb,
a Holocaust survivor and a US Army veteran. They have been married 65 years this year.
Rae went back to court after her daughter Lynn was born. When her son Barry was born,
Rae became a stay-at-home mom. She then went to work in the Hebrew afternoon school
system. Rae started a career in real estate in 1978, and retired 33 years later in 2011. Rae
and Harvey's two children, Lynn and Barry, are both architects and live in the Washington, DC
area. Rae and Harvey have two grandchildren, twins who will be 15 in August, and Rae's son
Barry is here with us today. Both Rae and Harvey have led active lives. Rae played tennis
weekly until recently, and Harvey, who is 92, ran six miles daily until he was 80. Rae says
she is now "fully engaged with the Museum." You will find Rae here on Wednesdays
volunteering with Visitor Services. Rae recently spoke to cadets at the U.S. Naval Academy.
Among the audience was a young woman cadet who turns out to be a relative of Rae's. She
has spoken at such places are retirement homes and local schools. And in 2016 she spoke
at major conferences about aging to relay her experiences as a survivor, resiliency, and now
facing her own aging.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Rae
Goldfarb.

(Applause)

Rae, thank you so much for joining us today and being willing to be our First Person.
We have just an hour, so we won't be able to cover everything, but | know that you'll share
with us as much as you possibly can in this time. And we're going to start first, though, Rae,
with before we talk about the war and the Holocaust, tell us a little bit about your life before
the war, your family, your community, what it was like.

Rae Goldfarb: | lived in a very small town which was on the Russian border. Poland
was a democracy at the time. Dokszyce had liberated the area and Poland became a
democracy. We were on the border with Russia. The town was like four kilometers from the
Russian border and there was a military installation there of the Polish Army. Life was very
pleasant. As far as | remember | had all the conveniences and lived in a household that had a
lot of help. Both my parents were in business. My mother had a fabric store and my father

was supplying the Army garrison and also exporting to Germany. Life was good and | started
an early education. | had a nanny, or at that time they called them a governess, that taught
me to read and to speak Hebrew and, of course, Polish and the native language there was
Belarus. | did not expect to be in the circumstances that eventually evolved. My father died in
1937 after a trip to the German border to deliver some goods. At that time there were some
Jews that were deported from Germany, Polish Jews that were considered non-citizens.
They came to better their lives in Germany because it was a much more progressive country
and they were deported when the Hitler regime came into power. He went to visit them and
got some sort of an infection. Could not find the -- any medication for it, could not find any
help for him, and he died. My mother took over both businesses and was very much engaged
in the business. Needless to say, my upbringing was mostly by the help in the house. So
was my brothers. My brother was three years younger -- three or four -- between three or four
years younger than me. The war broke out --

>> Bill Benson: Rae, one other question before we turn to the war. Your father, as |
said, died when you were young. Do you have memories of him?

Rae Goldfarb: Only the memory of the picture and | remember certain incidents. |
know he was tall because when he put me on his shoulders | almost reached the chandelier
and was a high ceiling. The reason | remember that is because electricity was installed in the
house, which wasn't very prevalent in that part of Poland. And | remember that particular
incident. Other than that, | remember very little of my father.

Bill Benson: And | was going to also ask you, tell us about the interactions between
your family and other Jews with the Christian community in Dokszyce.

Rae Goldfarb: Well, both my parents were in business, so they had a lot of contact
with the farm population. The general population had to buy fabrics in order to make their
clothes. They didn't go to a department store like you do now. And mother not just had a
store but she also distributed to smaller stores. She did kind of wholesaling because she
would buy the fabrics in bolts and needless to say it was too much fabric for her store, so she
would sell it to other stores.

The farmers would come and the general population from town would come to buy the
fabrics. As far as | can remember she was the only fabric store in the town and in the
surrounding area.

My father, again, had a lot of contact because he bought up produce, he bought up
animals, he was involved in the slaughter of animals and providing the meat for the Polish
Army, and supplied the meat also for the Jewish population. There was a quota. You could
only slaughter so much for the Jewish population which required a special way of slaughter.
He got around it by having it all slaughtered the humane way which would consider the way
the Jews are required to slaughter an animal so it does not suffer and the town was very
prosperous. There were between 2,500 and 3,000 Jews in the town and general population
of the town was about 6,000. Aijd lot of interaction with the community outside because |
remember taking matza to the Greek orthodox -- well, he called them the (saying foreign
word). | guess he was calling the priest. And he would give me honey. He was producing
honey. And | remember decorating a Christmas tree with a family in the -- an outlying village.
The ornaments that were made was to make a hole at the top to have egg and the bottom of
the egg and blow out the contents and then paint a face on it, attach a hat with a string to
hang on the Christmas tree.

Bill Benson: You remember that.

Rae Goldfarb: | remember that. Silly things | remember. Important things I'm not so
sure.

Bill Benson: September 1, 1939, Germany invades Poland, starting world war --

Rae Goldfarb: No, no, Russia invades Poland.

Bill Benson: No, September 1, Germany invades Poland and Russia comes --

Rae Goldfarb: My part. I'm only concerned with my part.

(Laughter)

Bill Benson: So there's an agreement between Germany and Russia.

Rae Goldfarb: That's right.

Bill Benson: Two weeks later the Russians come in and occupy your town.

Rae Goldfarb: They came in at night -- well, most of my memory from those things are
my mother's description of things. The Russians came in at night. The tanks rolled in without
any notice, no war declaration, no notice. Germany had declared war on Poland, but our part,
there was -- which was a long distance from the German/Russian -- from the German/Polish
border T Russians just marched in overnight and took over half of Poland. And that became
an occupation that lasted for two years.

Bill Benson: So tell us what life was like under the Soviet occupation, under the
Russians during those first couple of years of the war.

Rae Goldfarb: The Russian system believed that any kind -- anybody who was
engaged in commerce was not a suitable profession. Everything was owned by the state. My
mother very quickly distributed the contents of the store to friendly farmers that she had
contact with, with the agreement that they would provide us with some food in exchange for
the fabrics and to use whatever they needed. She also hid some of even our clothing, her
coats, our better coats, with the farmers for the simple reason because the Russians looted.
The soldiers would come in. And one of the things that she always told about and laughed
about is that she had some silk nightgowns and the Russians had confiscated those and
some of the women were marching around with them in the street.

Also, that | remember is that we had an alarm clock, which wasn't really small. It was
like the small bin that is I've seen here in this country, and a Russian soldier actually strapped
it on his wrist

Bill Benson: Like a watch.

Rae Goldfarb: Like a watch. That was a big possession. It was called "chasy." We
had watches. They were good sized, they weren't tiny watches, that my mother and father
wore, but those they had hidden, of course.

Bill Benson: They had those hidden. And you were forced to go to Russian school
once the Russians were in, right?

Rae Goldfarb: | went to a Hebrew parochial school that my father started and | actually
was enrolled in the school at the age of three because they needed a certain amount of
students. When the Russians came in of course any of the parochial schools, whether they
were Christian or Jewish were closed and everybody had to attend the public school, which
was Russian indoctrination. That's best way | can describe it. And as | told you, Bill, one of
the achievements that | thought at the time was a big one, anybody who did not belong to the
Communist Party or had associated with them was not allowed to reach -- well, there were
certain requirements in order to get into the lowest branch of the communist hierarchy and
that was called the pioneer. And in order to become a pioneer either your parents had to be
socialist, communist, or you had to achieve a high grade in your marks in school. And like all

)
kids, and I'm sure | was no different than a lot of the kids here in the United States that
wanted to belong to some sort of a group, | had to achieve to get the red kerchief with the
hammer and sickle that held it together. And | was so proud of it. And of course when | came
home, my mother said oh, boy.

Bill Benson: And what's your family was considered -- because they had businesses
and were considered bourgeois, your family was fearful that you would end up getting sent to
Siberia.

Rae Goldfarb: Correct. Many of the wealthier people in town, they would come at
night, just tell them to take whatever they can with them in hand, a bundle, and they would
deport them to Siberia. Actually it would have been a blessing had we been deported. My
mother had a backpack -- here you would call ate backpack. At that time it was a bag with
things, ready in case they came at night. Because she was a widow | guess she wasn't one
of the first ones considered for the deportation.

Bill Benson: As you said a moment ago, you would have wished you had been sent.

Rae Goldfarb: We wished we had -- we would have had a better chance for survival,
the whole family.

Bill Benson: Speaking of that, in June 1941, Germany turned on the Soviets and
quickly conquered all the territory that the Russians had in Poland. The German Army
entered your town in the late summer of 1941. By the end of 1941 the Germans forced you
and the other Jews into a Dokszyce to a ghetto. Tell us what you recall about that.

Rae Goldfarb: What | recall the first thing is we had to wear an insignia. I'm sure many
of you have heard of the yellow star. We had to wear it on the clothing front, on the left front,
right back, on inner and outer garments, needless to say for a kid it was considered a badge
of shame. Also, we were not allowed to -- if anybody walked on the sidewalk, we had to step
off. And considering that in the part of the country that | lived snow started to fall in October
and stayed on the ground until Easter. There was no mode of communication.
Communication was by horse and buggy or horseback. Needless to say the streets weren't
very clean. When one was pushed off into the street | hate to tell you what | came home
smelling like and that was a badge of shame. And of course felt much, much depressed.
Before the winter set in the Jews were all collected into a ghetto. The ghetto was not what
you consider here a ghetto where it has a certain segment of the population living and called
a ghetto because it's inhabited by a group associated with each other sort of. The ghetto was
like a prison. One side of the ghetto, | don't know if you have the picture --

Bill Benson: We aren't able to show it here.

Rae Goldfarb: Okay. One side of the ghetto was a river. One side of the ghetto was
the Main Street and actually our house fell into the ghetto because the houses on that street
all had gates that closed the yards, sort of blocked off from the street and the rest of it was
fenced. There were guards around it. People were not allowed to go out and in at leisure.
They were only allowed out when Germans took people to do some labor for them or during
market day which the farmers could come to a certain gate in the ghetto to barter food with
the ghetto inhabitants. Also, the first thing that they did is they had everyone to come to an
open area and counted the population. Everything was accounted for. The ghetto, they
appointed -- Jews even during non-occupation time, had what they call the committee council
that was working with the Jewish population there for charities, for people that needed help,
interceding between people and with the government, and they appointed those people to
intercede with the Nazi government. Those people were supposed to supply the Nazis with

first they wanted gold and silver. They call it for the benefit of the German armies to conquer
Russia. That was the --

Bill Benson: That was the line.

Rae Goldfarb: That was the line. Needless to say, a lot of it ended up in their own
pockets. Silver, gold, it was like a ransom. Every so often they required a supply of certain
things. It also came down, not just to gold and silver and money, it came down to utensils of
copper and even iron and that was all for the war effort.

Bill Benson: So literally pots and pans.

Pots and pans. Pots and pans. Anything they consider a value actually.

Bill Benson: Right.

Rae Goldfarb: The population was used as forced labor. The German Army was
stationed in the barracks where the Polish Army had before and the German armies were
more motorized than the Polish armies were, so they needed work on cleaning the stables,
doing their laundry, doing their cooking, whatever menial jobs they had, and also for
roadwork. So they would take a number of people out in the morning, bring them back at
night. Everybody was counted and the population had to report back and the same number
that they left.

At one time a few younger people had managed to escape and the count was not full.
They brought the committee out and asked them to present those two people. Of course they
couldn't because they had escaped. The retribution was ten for one. They would not allow
that committee to offer themselves as hostages. Some of the people, some old men came
out and said their life wasn't worth much anyway and they're willing to be counted as the
hostages. But that was not acceptable to them. What they wanted is for that committee to
select ten for each, 20 people in all, young men of the same age, of the same health, to be
presented to the Nazis. That was a very difficult task for them. How do you give somebody
up? They took those people and they shot them in front of the whole population of the ghetto.
They just gunned them down. Needless to say A lot of people considered escape as a
sentence of death to others, so very view have tried to escape. A few of them managed to
escape, though, but not many

Bill Benson: Rae, you said that it wasn't long after the German occupation that in your
words they started diminishing the ghetto.

Rae Goldfarb: Yes. Within several months, under the disguise of resettlement, they
said they were going to take the Jews to a larger ghetto so that they would have
consolidation. And at first they asked everybody to come to the -- to the area, the open area
and they selected people. They selected a lot of young ones, a lot of children, and some
older people, too. A mixture. They did not take them to any larger ghetto. They took them to
a pit and gunned them down. Word came back about it. People started to build hiding
places, plan for hiding places. So the second time around there were not so many people
that came out to the area when they called for resettlement, the second time, so they basically
went house to house and pulled people out. Those that had hiding places of course hid. Our
family house and warehouse were L-shaped and between the warehouse and the family
house there was a space between the walls. From what my mother told me it was used as
basically a safe. We didn't have iron safes but this was --

Bill Benson: A hiding place for valuables.

Rae Goldfarb: -- a hiding place for valuables, right. For any accounting books and so
forth. Things that they needed in the business. And it was covered with -- by the same route,

https://collections.ushmm.org

rf
so it was a continuation route, it didn't look like there were two different buildings. And there
was access to an attic in that area and that became the hiding place. So when word spread
and when it was -- became obvious that they were again looking for people supposedly to
resettle, we went into that hiding place. Eventually -- this time of the year, it was after
Passover that the ghetto was shrunken to such a point where we knew that was the last thing.
And Mother tried to find places -- ways to actually get out before, but it was impossible.
We -- the final closing of the ghetto, we climbed into that hiding place. There were food
provisions and water provisions there, very little sanitation available. We climbed into that
place and we were hiding there.

Bill Benson: And who was with you? Tell us who was with you in that hiding place.

Rae Goldfarb: My mother took of course me and my brother in. | know my
grandmother was there, and there were some other people. | don't remember who.

Bill Benson: But your grandmother was with you.

Rae Goldfarb: My grandmother was with us and basically saved us eventually. But we
hid in that place. From what my mother told me, we were there between eight and ten days.
Conditions became horrible and we had to -- some of the people couldn't stand it anymore. If
you are enclosed with no light, the only thing you could hear was what was going on outside
because the houses were not built of -- not too many with much brick. It was mostly wood.
So sound penetrated. You couldn't even speak loud. You had to speak in whispers. Some of
the people just couldn't stand it anymore and came -- went out. They were caught but they
never disclosed who else was hiding. At the end, from what my mother told us, well, | know
my mother, my brother, and | and my grandmother were there, there were several other
people. We climbed out. My mother was first and of course had to help us down. Me and my
brother and my grandmother and some of the other people, there were a couple of children, |
know that, that came out with us, we thought that it was all quiet for a certain amount of time
but obviously there were some looters that thought they might find something. And all of a
sudden we heard voices. It was nighttime. We hid -- there was another place in a pantry that
was a root cellar that was a hiding place. Mother took us quickly to that root cellar.
Grandmother was behind us so she covered us with a cover and she acted crazy. When she
was asked was anyone else here she said | don't know anything. | was laying there, | was
half out, and | don't know much. And she acted crazy. They took her away. My mother
heard her be taken away.

We stayed until the next night and we ventured out. Mother figured the best way to
cross was across the river. | remember the name of the river, it was the Berezina, and it
started -- it was still pretty narrow at our place and not too deep, and we waded the river and
were met by two guards. Mother knew them, they knew my mother. Everybody in town knew
my mother. She had told them to put their rifles on their back. They knew that she had
valuables. She said she'll give them whatever she has to let us run. Little did she figure that
eventually they would tell on us anyway. She had a watch with a gold chain that she put into
the hands of one of them and kind of wrapped it around his wrist so he wouldn't lose it. And
she gave some trinkets to the other guard. She told him to put out his hands so she can put
the trinkets in. By the time it took them to dispose of those trinkets to put them away in the
pockets, we were able to run.

We ran to a village where we used to go at Christmas time to help decorate the
Christmas tree. My father's best friend. He agreed to hide my brother and suggested that his
sister, who had a daughter my age, that she would be able to hide me. My mother left my

brother with him and we went to his sister's house. She fed us, of course, and we got to clean
up a little bit, and word came to her that they were beating up her brother. His mother-in-law
told on him because she would get ten kilo sugar for disposing -- exposing a Jew. So she
was willing to risk that. They beat up her son-in-law until he finally told them where my
brother was hidden. However, he had enough sense to send his own son to his sister's house
just to tell her that the Germans were trying to take my brother away and they were beating up
on his father. Needless to say, his sister packed us up very quickly and sent us off.

She sent us to hide ina bathhouse. There was a stone bathhouse at the end of the
village. The villagers did not, needless to say, have showers and bathtubs or
bathrooms -- one or more bathrooms in the house, and so they -- on Saturday they went to
clean up for church and they would go to the bathhouse to take their baths. And we hid there
overnight. And then we ventured off.

The next place we basically everything on foot. By night we walked, during the day we
hid. And we got to the house of the woman that took care of my brother. She hid us and she
went off to town to find out where my brother was. Unfortunately had we gone there first, |
don't know, maybe my brother would have been alive because she wanted to see if she could
get my brother. She had no children and she would have raised him as her own. However,
she found out that he was shot. And that was May 8, 1942.

Bill Benson: And he was six or seven years of age?

Rae Goldfarb: No, he was four years of age.

Bill Benson: Four years of age.

Rae Goldfarb: Four years of age. No, I'm sorry, he was --

Bill Benson: He was six.

Rae Goldfarb: He was six or seven years of age. He was four when the picture was
taken.

Bill Benson: Right.

Rae Goldfarb: By the way, that picture you saw first, that's the only possession | have
and the only memory | have of my brother. The only possession | have from -- from my
home.

Bill Benson: So once your mom got this -- your mom got this horrible news, what did
you do then?

Rae Goldfarb: Well, my mother decided that the safest place was to get to the larger
ghetto. And so we went again to a farmer. We had many farmer friends, but everybody was
afraid. They were afraid because anybody could expose them and that meant death to their
families. And to us, of course. This particular woman was a widow whose husband had died
a few years back and my father basically helped her save the farm. He extended funds to her
so she could continue on and she hid us overnight. The next day was market day, and the
farmers would take their -- whatever produce they had to sell to the market. She loaded the
wagon with the produce and instead of herself and her son and daughter going to the
marketplace, she dressed me in her daughter's clothes, my mother in her clothes, and the son
drove the wagon and we went to this larger city where there was a ghetto still with Jews.

With the crowds we managed to steal into the ghetto and of course the son sold his
produce and went back home. In the ghetto it was the same arrangement and you had -- in
this larger ghetto you had to have documents. Because you could not even move around in
the ghetto without documents. My mother was able to obtain documents for me and myself.
That's when | became born in 1930, even though | was two years younger. It also qualified

me --

Bill Benson: Was that just accidental or was that a deliberate decision?

Rae Goldfarb: | don't really know. That's the document she was able to obtain.

Bill Benson: Okay.

Rae Goldfarb: And it's of little consequence to me other than the fact that | was able to
go out with the workforce.

Bill Benson: Because you were two years older.

Rae Goldfarb: Because | was old enough to do some work. All | can tell you is that if
you couldn't get out to work, the next time they came to shrink the ghetto, you were one of the
selected people. My work was -- and that | remember -- tying -- in a spinning wheel, tying the
wool threads that had broken. | had to be very quick and fortunately | had nimble fingers. My
mother was taken out as a laundress. So we had the ability to leave the ghetto with the
workforce. With my mother's contacts during market days, she was able to connect with a
friend of my father's who smuggled a gun into a basket of eggs to my mother. Supposedly he
was selling her the eggs. And she had something to offer. She knew there were Russian
prisoners of war that managed to escape the Germans who mistreated them badly and
formed themselves into a resistance to slow the progress of the Nazis to the front lines. And
so she had something to offer. And one day, with the workforce going out to the assignment,
we walked out with the farmers --

Bill Benson: To go to your jobs.

Rae Goldfarb: We walked out to go to the jobs, but we walked out of the city with the
farmers returning. Some of them would come by wagon and some of them would bring
produce on foot. The ones that the village was closer would bring produce on foot. So this is
how we got out of the ghetto.

Bill Benson: So you're out to have ghetto. Your mother has taken you to sneak into
the ghetto and now you've gotten out of it.

Rae Goldfarb: We snuck out. We had the clothing, the farmersâ€™ clothing that we could
blend into the farm population and could walk out.

Bill Benson: Your mom's objective now was to link up with those partisans.

Rae Goldfarb: The partisans. She actually had plans before, they built a tunnel under
the barbed wire fencing. Somebody got word of it, some young man, and they used the
tunnel before the time and they were caught by the Germans. And so that route was closed
to us.

Bill Benson: So from there, Rae, your mother and you make your way into the
partisans in the forest. And so in a -- give us a sense of what that was like. It's hard to
imagine. Here's your mother, escaped out of the ghetto with a young child going into the
woods, finding a group of resistance fighters, the partisans, and joining up with them. First,
how did she even get welcomed into the resistance?

Rae Goldfarb: Well, that was her idea. She had the gun. The Russian prisoners of
war were marched -- that's what she told me, to the town and even when some of the
non-Jewish -- well, the Jewish population couldn't but the non-Jewish population would offer
them water, they would hit them with the rifle butts and would not let them accept the water.
They got so disgusted of course and saw that there was no -- no avenue of escape for them.
They started to escape en masse. Some of them were shot and some of them, of course, got
away. The area is surrounded by forests, pine forests. Any of you have gone to cut your own
Christmas trees? You have seen how low the pine -- the pine branches are? Well, that's how

we could hide. | slept many a night under those pine branches and hopefully not a cone
under my back. They escaped en masse and gathered in the forest. They had no guns to
protect themselves or to do any harm to the progress of the Germans to the front lines. At
first they laid down their rifles and became prisoners of war and then we had to fight their way
to remain alive. And so they would try to catch some soldiers who were out on assignments.
However, they did not shoot them, because then, you know, they would -- they will get a force
coming to fight them. So what they did was, is they would take away their rifles, take away
their clothing. In the first place they had some Nazi uniforms, the German uniforms so they
could disguise themselves to do their work, and they would leave them in their underwear and
tell them -- tell them that the farmer caught you with his daughter so he made you run so they
could save face. They had the rifles and they had some German clothing so they could
infiltrate and they could also start fighting back. Most of the work of the partisans was to
disrupt the progress to the front lines, the German progress to the front lines, to fight the
Russians.

The work was to dislodge -- excuse me. The work was to dislodge the railroad ties so
the trains would derail. Needless to say, they could collect some ammunition from the trains
and use that ammunition to blow up some of the roads. They weren't -- they were mostly
cobblestone roads. There were some roads that were paved as the Germans progressed and
they used the labor of the population. So this way they -- they could slow the -- the lines to
the front

Bill Benson: So Rae, tell us what your mother and you were doing with the partisans.

Rae Goldfarb: Well, basically Mother was cooking the soup. Mostly potato soup.

Bill Benson: She was their cook.

Rae Goldfarb: She was their cook. Mother didn't cook at home.

( Laughter )

But she learned. She was a good observer, and she knew if you fried onions that they
make the soup a little better. And so they loved the soup. Also, the farmers had to give the
Germans a certain amount of their produce and sometimes they would come and take their
cattle, their cows, and of course their horses were all taken. And they would -- the farmers
finally drove the livestock into the forest -- further into the forest for grazing and the partisans
were the guards. So -- and the Germans were afraid to go into the forest because they would
encounter the resistance.

As the front lines started to move forward, the Russian armies kind of joined up with
some of the partisans. They didn't really join them but what they did was is they supplied
them with ammunition, basically grenades because that would blow up railroad cars and
some ammunition for the guns. They would drop it and the partisans really organized
themselves as an Army. And the Russians dropped some people of rank that could manage
them. They also set up a hospital, and | wound up in one of them because | got sick with
typhus. Mother managed to get me to that hospital because we were with a forward group.
You would call it a reconnaissance group, at the edge of the forest. And we wound up not
with our group but all the way in the back of the forest in the hospital. By the time the Russian
armies were pushing the Germans out, they had a front line to -- to consider and then the
back line. The partisans were kind of surrounding them, so they started to fight the partisans.
And the partisans dispersed. Mother and |, of course, were stuck in the hospital. | was well
enough to walk, however, | -- my head was bald. It was shaved. My hair was shaved
because the -- typhus was spread by lice and of course everybody tried not to have any hair.

That's where they hid the most

Bill Benson: You mentioned a little while ago that you slept many nights under pine
needle branches in the pine forest.

Rae Goldfarb: Oh, yes.

Bill Benson: But really the conditions were really tough. You were living in the woods,
food was meager, the weather was awful at times, it was a really very harsh environment for
you.

Rae Goldfarb: It -- it was a very harsh environment. But the farmers -- the farmers
were mostly -- they were cognizant of the fact that the partisans were there and to some
degree the partisans did not loot them. The partisans did not take away their grain that was
next year's crop basically. They could -- they could sow their grain, their seed. And their
animals were kind of preserved. So they were willing to supply some of the things to the
partisans, basically foodstuffs. But at times when -- when the Germans came into the villages
and since we were a forward group, we were more exposed to them, we had to hide and then
we would run into the forest.

Food was scarce. Potatoes -- Belarus is known for its potatoes so potatoes were
pretty plentiful and also root vegetables. And of course there were mushrooms in the forest. |
knew which mushrooms to eat and which not to. And there were cranberries because there
were marches

Bill Benson: Lived off the land, to some extent. In the time we have left, | there are
some things you want to tell us. You were caught by the Russians with the partisans and
then had a very narrow escape. Tell us about that.

Rae Goldfarb: When the partisans dispersed and we were with no group, basically we
were caught up with the farmers, with the population. And the population was taken out of the
villages and brought -- well, the closest place was our hometown and they put us ina
warehouse. We were caught with the population. At one point they started the -- Nazis were
famous for separating females from males, even children. Female children from male
children. And there were no young -- not too many young men because the young men were
afraid. Either they were taken into the German armies or they basically had to join with the
partisans. So they started to separate the females from the males, and | had no hair and |
was dressed like a boy and | was being separated from my mother. | was sent with the boys.

Since | Knew Yiddish which is a very similar language to German, they were debating
whether | was a girl or a boy because the features looked more like a girl but the dress and no
hair prompted them to think | was a boy. And | said the only word that would get me back to
my mother which was "mechen" which meant girl. And they -- some of them decided | may be
Jewish because how would | know the word, the German word. Most of the farmers were
very illiterate and did not pick up languages. Mother got word of it, because she was hiding.
She was in her hometown with the population that knew her very well, and she came out and
approached the Germans and said that | was her daughter. They had gallows set up. They
were famous for hanging people. They put me under the gallows and they said to her, we
won't touch you, but tell us is this a Jewish child? And my mother said no, she is my
daughter. She is not Jewish. She knew a few words of German because | was doing your
laundry. And | am slow, | can't understand, | can't learn a language, but she's a child and she
learned a few words. And they decided if my mother offered herself to be hung first and they
did not recognize her as Jewish then she's probably telling the truth. And they let us go.

Bill Benson: So then you rejoined the partisans after that.

Rae Goldfarb: Well, what happened was they sent the villagers back to their villages
and we had no village to go to. Mother gave them the name of a village. She knew the area
very well, of a way distant village so that we kind of had to pass and stop at many villages,
different villages. We finally came to a place where some of the villagers couldn't go any
further because of the front lines and somebody recognized my mother. However, there was
another woman that heard about it and she did not have any ill feelings towards Jews and she
knew my mother for the type of person that she was and she came over to her and she says
look, | recognized you a long time ago but | kept quiet. But there's a murmur that somebody
said they think they recognized you and they know that you're Dina, the fabric store owner.
So | would suggest that you make yourself scarce. Mother took me and we ran again. And at
that point we were able to find some of the partisans. We ran basically toward the front lines
because we knew that that's my mother, | didn't know anything, my mother knew that that's
where probably the partisans would go and that's to help the Russian armies. And so we did
get with the partisans and we were liberated by the Russians.

Bill Benson: And tell us about your liberation.

Rae Goldfarb: Oh, after -- well, when we were liberated, we went to live in the bigger
city where we were in the second ghetto because we heard that some of the Jews managed
to escape that ghetto and gathered there. Mother went to our hometown to see who survived.
You go to the place where you come from, if you're looking for someone. A neighbor gave
her the photograph that you saw on the screen. She picked it up from the garbage. She told
my mother she did not loot her house. She invited her to her house and said look at my
house, | have nothing from your house. You were a good neighbor and a good friend. |
picked up the picture as a memento of you. But | would suggest that you don't spend the
night because | would love to have you as my guest but both you and | would not survive the
night. She gave my mother some bread and food and of course the photograph, and mother
came back to the bigger ghetto, basically again, walking with 30 kilometers. It wasn't an easy
walk.

Bill Benson: Rae, | think we have time to turn to our audience to ask some questions.

Rae Goldfarb: Okay.

Bill Benson: But before we do, | would like you to, if you would, talk about your mother
was just an extraordinary woman in every way.

Rae Goldfarb: Mother was -- she was smart, needless to say, but she was also very
resourceful and she could look ahead and see what to do next. She always planned, and |
guess it was easy for her to plan ahead. | don't Know. | guess all of us plan ahead.

Bill Benson: Tell us about her -- at the end of the water, you were liberated in the
summer of '44 but the war went on, of course, until May of '45.

Rae Goldfarb: Correct.

Bill Benson: Your mother was able to get you on a train fixing water towers.

Rae Goldfarb: Mother enlisted. As a partisan --

Bill Benson: She enlisted in the Russian Army.

Rae Goldfarb: She enlisted in the Russian Army as a worker and we -- we got lodging
in a boxcar and traveled with the train to fix water towers. We got as far as Prussia where
conditions were awful and she managed to get our train car attached to a train that was
heading south to a city called Lublin where there was -- it was a big city and it was very close
to one of the concentration camps, and that's where the survivors gathered. We got -- I'll
make it short now. We got to that city and they had already some establishment with the

Jews in Palestine where they sent groups to try to bring the Jews out of Poland into what was
then called Palestine and now is Israel. And we basically -- | learned my geography on foot.
We walked, rode, until we got to Italy. We were caught at one point we thought we were in
the Russian -- the American zone, we ended up in the British zone, they sent us back to the
Russian zone and eventually went through the alp passes, the Alpian passes into Italy. The
first city we went into was Padua, then Modena, and then we ended up in Santa Cesarea.

Bill Benson: The very end of the boot of Italy.

Rae Goldfarb: The very end of the boot of Italy with the hope of crossing the
Mediterranean into what was then Palestine, being Israel. However, I'm sure all of you have
heard, or maybe the adults have heard about the exodus, the ship that was caught and the
people taken off at Cyprus and became kind of imprisoned there. We missed that ship by this
much. Mother started to look for my aunt and uncle who immigrated to the United States and
she had memorized the address. The only thing she forgot was the two letters after
Washington. She wrote the letters to Washington but it went to Washington State.

(Laughter)

The letters came back, and of course it had to be Washington, DC but she put an ad in
a Jewish newspaper and my uncle saw it and contacted us, went and made out -- for making
out immigration papers. He had to promise to support us, provide lodging, food, clothing,
medical, and education for me and deposit $5,000 in 1947, which was a fortune. He
mortgaged his store -- he had a grocery store -- in order to supply the guarantee for us to
come to the United States.

Bill Benson: Rae, we're going to turn to our audience, but is my memory correct that
you -- you couldn't get over here because the -- the Polish quota for coming here was so -- so
restrictive so you were able to end up getting on a Russian quota which allowed you to get
here. And the other thing | want to say is that because your identification papers had you two
years and you really were, when you came here, you were -- you were Officially 17 on record,
you were really only 15, but you were 17 but they put you here in school in kindergarten or
first grade.

Rae Goldfarb: Elementary school.

Bill Benson: Elementary school at age 17 but you quickly made your way up. So let's
turn to our audience. And we will hear again from Rae to close our program. But we do have
a couple minutes for some questions. I'm going to ask you to make your question as brief as
you can. We'll have mics in the aisle. Please wait until you have a microphone in your hand
to ask the question. Keep it brief. | will repeat the question to be sure that everybody,
including Rae, hears the question and then she'll respond to it. And I'm going to turn first, if |
can, to Kai here because she's getting questions on the Internet from people who are tweeting
and on the Internet. Kai, you have a question.

>> Yes, good morning, Rae. The question we have via Twitter is while volunteering at
the museum and sharing your story, can you tell us about your most memorable visitor that
you've met?

Bill Benson: Tell about the most memorable visitor that you have met here at the
museum. Your most memorable visitor.

Rae Goldfarb: Most memorable visitor. My most memorable visitor here at the
museum was actually somebody who was from Belarus. | was surprised because we have
many visitors from many countries, South American countries, even as far as Australia, New
Zealand, from Africa, and here somebody shows up from Belarus. And he says how did you

survive?

( Laughter )

| said well, there was some good ones.

Bill Benson: Uh-huh. Was he living here or was she actually a visitor --

Rae Goldfarb: No, he was living here. He escaped too.

Bill Benson: He escaped too. Okay. All right. Do we have anybody who has a
question, and I'll try to spot you, but I'll ask the ushers to help me do that.

Rae Goldfarb: Actually there was one more that | wanted to mention.

Bill Benson: Okay.

Rae Goldfarb: There was a gentleman -- that was a while back -- from Cambodia that
was very much surprise that had he saw the exhibit on Cambodia at the Holocaust Museum.
And of course | told him that we're concerned with all the atrocities that happen anywhere, this
museum, sure, is -- commemorates the Holocaust because that was the most horrible, the
biggest extermination of people for no other reason but because the Nazis instilled so much
hate into the public against the Jews and against other segments of the population that with
their lives we were able to inflict so much unnecessary pain and destruction of human life.
And he was impressed with the fact that Cambodia, which had a much smaller atrocity, was
commemorated here. Not only that, he took out his wallet, he became a member of the
museum, and gave $100 --

Bill Benson: No kidding.

Rae Goldfarb: -- donation. He said I'm sorry, | don't have any more right now to spare.
And | thought, you know, for a moment there, | forgot about it.

Bill Benson: Thank you for sharing that one. We have a question right here.

Audience Member: Hi. Hi, Rae. Thank you. So impressed with your life and the
strength of your -- your story and that of your mom. How -- when you came back over here,
how long did your mother survive?

Bill Benson: Tell us how long your mom survived is the question.

Rae Goldfarb: My mom lived to the ripe old age of 99 1/2.

(Applause)

She died of a massive stroke. And amazingly enough she died on the same English
date as my brother was shot. It was -- it was amazing that she survived. The doctors couldn't
understand how she was holding on. And yet, on the morning, 8:00 in the morning, on the
same date, | got word from the hospital that she had passed away.

Bill Benson: Wow. That was in 2006, wasn't it?

Rae Goldfarb: 2006.

Bill Benson: | think we have time for one more question. Okay. And let me just
mention, | should have mentioned this before, Rae -- after she finishes in a moment, Rae will
stay up here on the stage and we invite anybody who would like to ask her a question that
didn't get a chance to do so or meet her or have your picture taken with her. Absolutely feel
free to come up on the stage afterwards. We welcome that. So let's take our last question
here.

Audience Member: Thank you, Rae. So | have a question about the beginning of the
war. Were you expecting like all the Nazis to invade?

Bill Benson: Were you expecting there to be an invasion of Poland when you were
young? Was your family expecting the Nazis to come in or the Russians?

Rae Goldfarb: | wasn't expecting anything. When -- when you are that age, all you're

interested in is your friends, your studies, and even though conditions were bad in the ghetto,
was still -- my mother had always had a tutor for us and she encouraged me, even during
hiding, she was very good at math and she used to teach me math, with the potatoes.

(Laughter)

Bill Benson: With the potatoes.

Rae Goldfarb: With the potatoes. And you don't expect anything like that. You don't
anticipate because if people would have anticipated. But the other thing is that we couldn't go
anywhere. Without -- without papers, my husband's family had papers to immigrate to the
United States. He actually came here on a Visa that was issued before -- before the Nazis
occupied Poland, but they just didn't get on a ship. We wouldn't have been able to come here
if my mother couldn't have convinced the American council that she really was born when it
was Russia because she named all the areas around it. And she was born before the first
world war and that was Russia. And we came here on a Russian quota. Otherwise, people
had to wait years in order to come to the United States.

Bill Benson: And it still took until 1947, two years after the war ended.

Rae Goldfarb: Two years, that's right.

Bill Benson: We have a tradition at First Person and that is that our First Person has
the last word. And so before | turn back to Rae for her last word, | want to, one, thank
everybody for being with us today. Remind you, we'll have a First Person program each
Wednesday and Thursday through the middle of August and invite you to come back. Again,
Rae will remain on the stage when she finishes, so absolutely, please come on up, and then |
think -- | think that's probably it. I'm going to turn to Rae for her closing words.

Rae Goldfarb: The only thing is that over the years when | have spoken about the
Holocaust and kind of looked back at it, it was lies about segments of the population that
instilled hate in others. | couldn't imagine why | was hated because | was Jewish. We lived a
quiet life observing the rules of the country, didn't do anybody any harm, and created so much
hate against us. | was many times asked by students and by adults, don't you still hate the
Nazis? | hate their idea of what they did to us, of what they instilled in people. Almost 11
million people lost their lives. About 6 million of them were Jews. For no apparent reason,
because hate was instilled against them.

Bill Benson: Thank you, Rae.

(Applause)

Rae Goldfarb: Thank you all.

Bill Benson: Feel free to come up if some of you would like to ask Rae another
question. Absolutely feel free to do that. Thank you, Rae, so much.
