>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson, host of the museum's public program First Person. Thank
you for joining us today. This is our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First Person
today is Dr. Fritz Gluckstein whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person has been made possible by the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a twice weekly series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust
who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of
our First Person guests serve as volunteers here at this museum. We have had programs on
Wednesdays and Thursdays since March. Today's program concludes First Person for 2014.

Information about our 2015 program will be available from the Museum's website at
www.ushmm.org. Anyone interested in staying in touch with the Museum and its programs
can complete the Stay Connected card you'll find in your program or you can talk with one of
the museum representatives at the back of the theater when we conclude today's program. In
doing so, in completing the Stay Connected card, you will receive an electronic copy of Fritz
Gluckstein's biography so that you can remember and share his testimony after you leave here
today.

Fritz will share with us his First Person account of his experience as a Holocaust
survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, we will have an opportunity for you to ask Fritz a
few questions at the end of our program. The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the

decades. What you are about to hear from Fritz is one individual's account of a Holocaust.
We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.

Fritz Gluckstein was born in Berlin, Germany, on January 24, 1927. This photograph
was taken of Fritz in 1932. He was the son of a Jewish judge and Christian mother, Georg and
Hedwig Gluckstein. We see them at the beach.

These contemporary photographs show places where Fritz lived, attended school, and
played. Asa child, Fritz enjoyed family activities, friends, and school gatherings. Here we
have Fritz circled in the middle.

After the Nazis came to power, Fritz’ father lost his job as a judge and because of his
father's and mother's backgrounds, Fritz was considered a geltungsjude, a counted Jew. The
Nuremberg Law based Jewishness on genealogy and religious practice. This is the star that
Fritz, as a geltungsjude, was required to wear.

Throughout these difficult times Elfriede Dressler, Fritz's aunt, provided the
Glucksteins with much needed extra food as rations continued to decrease. In this photo we
see Fritz and his aunt Elfriede after the war.

At the end of the war, Fritz's parents stayed in Germany and his father resumed his
judicial career. Fritz decided to immigrate on his own to the United States and arrived in the
U.S. in 1948 where he studied veterinary medicine.

Today Fritz lives in the Washington, D.C. area with his wife. Following his arrival in
the United States after the war he eventually became a doctor of veterinary medicine. After a
stint in the U.S. Army, Fritz began a long and distinguished career with the federal

government, including at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and ending with the National
Library of Medicine. He became an expert on diseases that are transmitted from animals to
humans, like Mad Cow disease and, of course, in today's contemporary news we think of
things like Ebola.

Fritz is a self-described opera buff and football fan. He told me he likes to watch
football on TV while listening to the opera. He volunteers each week for the Museum
translating letters and other documents written in German, including handwritten documents.
He is among a few people who are able to read the old-style German cursive script. He has a
daughter, Ruth, and two granddaughters; one is 16 years old and the other 13. Fritz says they
are the joy of his life.

Fritz has authored a memoir about his survival in Berlin. After today's program he will
sign copies of his memoir: “Geltungsjude: Counted as a Jew in Hitler's Berlin,” available in the
museum's bookstore. Fritz donates all profits to this museum.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Dr. Fritz
Gluckstein.

[Applause]

Fritz, thank you so much for joining us today and for your willingness to be our First
Person. We have just an hour to spend with you and you have an awful lot to share with us.
I'll get us started right away.

You were just a young boy when Hitler came to power in Germany. Before we turn to
the actual war years, let’s start with you telling us about your family and yourself in those early
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
years, what it was like living under Nazi power as the power before the war. And as part of
that, tell us the meaning of geltungsjude and what that meant to you and your family.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Let me start explaining geltungsjude. Geltungsjudes are children of
intermarriages who were raised Jewish. They were subject to all rules and regulations, had to
wear the star, but at large were not deported. Geltungsjudes who had lived in Berlin were less
likely to be deported than Jews who lived somewhere else in the country. The farther you got
away from Berlin, the seat of power, the more you were subject to the local Kommandant.
Children of intermarriages that were not raised Jewish were not subject to all the regulations,
just a few, and did not have to wear the star.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: My father was a judge; decorated veteran, Iron Cross. He was quite
patriotic, always the flags on High Holiday. He even taught me how to salute the flag.

Growing up, | went to the zoo, enjoyed the animals. Take trips. My mother was
Lutheran but we celebrated the Christian holidays. And | had the best of two worlds:
Passover and Easter and Hanukkah and Christmas.
>> Bill Benson: Your father, as you said, he was a veteran of the First World War.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: He served in the German Army.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Correct.
>> Bill Benson: You said he was awarded the Iron Cross for bravery.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Actually, in 1936, the government established an honor for frontline

soldiers. And my father received the cross and certificate stating that he received the
declaration in the name of the Fuhrer. He lost his job in 1933. They gave the decoration.
>> Bill Benson: So they throw him out of his job as a judge but give him a decoration for his
First World War service.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: In 1933 he lost his job. They told him: Don't leave the building by the
front door. There's a double expression, Nazis. Father said, “Il came in by the front door and
I'll go out by the front door.”
>> Bill Benson: And he did.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: And he did.
>> Bill Benson: And he did.

You told me that the first anti-Semitism that you experienced was associated with the

1936 Olympics. Will you tell us about those Olympics?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: About this time you saw already signs, suburbs, with the sign “Jews are
not welcome here” or "Enter at your own risk." And even restaurants “Jews are not allowed.”
In 1936, the Olympic Games, all signs disappeared. The moment they were over, the signs
appeared again.
>> Bill Benson: Fritz, on a lighter note, you're a boy. You told me about mischief that you got
into during the Olympics with the tourists. You would point out things -- if you don't mind
sharing this.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: A friend of mine. Ahh, look over here. There is the war ministry. And the
poor people were confused.

>> Bill Benson: You were having your fun with the tourists.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Had fun with the tourists. Boys.
>> Bill Benson: At that time, Fritz, was your father and your family -- did they make any efforts
to try to leave Germany during that time?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. We all did. But, actually, at the beginning people thought, well, that
can't happen. Many people thought we lived here for many years, it might pass but then of
course realized it wouldn't; particularly after the Pogrom, Kristallnacht.

The United States, first there was a quota. You had to wait until your quota came up.
It took some time. And then, of course, you had to get an affidavit. That means somebody
had to sponsor you. Then you had to pay for the passage.

We had affidavit, the quota, but it was too late. We couldn't get passage. People
couldn't get out.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to move your microphone up just a hair if that's ok with you. Ok.
Thank you.

You mentioned Kristallnacht. You were just 11 on that night, November 9 through 10,
1938, what we call Kristallnacht or the Night of Broken Glass.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Correct.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about that and what it meant to you and your family.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | still remember going to school. Saw broken window. One window could
have happen, then two and three windows. | realized something was going on. We saw
smoke in the synagogues.

How did we know what they used to break? About two months previously, the store
owner had to have his name in white letters. All they had to do, here, here, here, and break
them.

| remember at that time, arrested, sent to the concentration camp. My father was
fortunate. It didn't happen to him but it happened to many of my teachers in high school. |
remember we had a little note saying due to special circumstances, report card will be late this
time.
>> Bill Benson: Due to special circumstances, your report cards would be late.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Due to special circumstances, the report card would be late.
>> Bill Benson: Did you realize that what you saw on that night, the Night of Broken Glass,
was not just happening in Berlin but it was happening all over Germany?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. We found out. Actually, it was much wore away from Berlin. Berlin
is actually -- friends phoned us. “How are you doing?” Well, they broke windows. They broke
in. They demolished the apartments. It was much worse away from Berlin.
>> Bill Benson: Fritz, you told me that the start of the war itself, when Germany invaded
Poland on September 1, 1939, that once that happened, events and circumstances changed in
a really big way.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what changed.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually, the night before that, Jews had to take the middle name Israel or
Sarah. My name was Fritz Israel Gluckstein. We got a special identification card which we

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,

had to present every time at the government office. | am a Jew. Show it. And each signature
was Fritz Israel Gluckstein. Jewish identification had number and this is so-and-so. Food
rationing, of course. Jews did not get food rations, no special allotment. No white bread, no
meat. And, of course, we were only permitted to shop between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon.
My mother couldn't shop at other times. A decent storekeeper, “Let me have your family's
Ration cards,” filled the order.

Of course, we had to hand over furs, radios, jewelry, and instruments. We were not
permitted to have haircuts. You can't imagine.
>> Bill Benson: Among the many things you were no longer allowed to have, that included
pets.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Pets, actually, yes. We had to give away -- the deportation started. Of
course people at that time had to give their pets. Later on the restriction to have pets came
later.

Actually, what happened, every night a new restriction. It was just harassment. You
almost waited: What was the next law? And, of course, deportation had started.
>> Bill Benson: When did you have to start wearing yellow stars?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: About the time 1941, the yellow star. Had to be worn right here. Actually
the population behaved very well. | remember happening to me walking on the street and
someone just walked ahead of me and then a can of soup or milk or something. Occasionally
there was a nasty policeman. See the star improperly fastened. So help you if he were behind
you with a pencil.

>> Bill Benson: It had to be on so tight he could not put his pencil behind it.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Stars we had to wear. And we had to hand over ration cards for the star.
>> Bill Benson: You had to buy it.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Ration cards with the star.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to come back to the fact that you couldn't have dogs because you
had a dog.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: In many ways it's ironic that you went on to become a veterinarian or a degree
in veterinary medicine. You had a specially trained dog.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Friends were deported. We took the dog. Yes. It was trained to
walk in a special way. When the dog came, his neck. From the Nazi. He didn't take it. Then
for the Jew. Then he took it.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: With your father having lost his job and the ability to go out and shop for Jews
between 4:00 and 5:00, although your mother could go out, how did you manage to make ends
meet? | think you had to change residences at some point.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Had to change to a smaller apartment. Money was tight. My father
worked unpaid, social service agency, Jewish welfare agency. If it had not been the war, it
would have been much worse because of a small pension. My aunt really helped us. She
bought everything from shoes to everywhere from birthday parties.

At that time also my mother's relatives stood with us. But the colleagues -- | still

remember my father's colleagues. Oh, we are so sorry; we have to break up contact with you.
My aunt helped a lot.
>> Bill Benson: You were able to stay in school until June of 1942 when the schools closed.
Before we turn to that period, you referred -- in fact, you write in your book so eloquently about
your teachers as everyday heroes. Can you say something about that?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Actually, at that time, in school, the deportation already had started.
Came in the morning. One was your neighbor. The teachers, they came to school every day
in very difficult times to teach us. They did their very best. They helped me for a while with the
uncertainties. They gave me a foundation on which | could build going back to school.

When | was their student, it didn't occur to me that the teachers were facing actually
deportation; that their efforts to live up to their profession. But | realized that they were under
great depth.
>> Bill Benson: And you really do pay tribute to them so eloquently.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: They came facing deportation but they still came and taught us. Actually,
the school was an oasis. Once the school door closed, we were students. At the end it was
35 and only seven survived. There were four Catholics including me and two. One went in
hiding. One came back from the concentration camp.
>> Bill Benson: And among the teachers virtually all --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Most teachers all perished.
>> Bill Benson: All perished.
When you received your final report card in June 1942, that was, indeed, your final

report card.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes, itwas. 1942. The reason why it was because of the dissolution of
the Jewish school system; the reason this was in ‘42.
>> Bill Benson: That was the end of your education.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The end of my education.
>> Bill Benson: And right after that you were forced to have to go to work.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually, | worked for a short time at the cemetery. It was kind of for the
local Jewish welfare agency. But then, of course, deportation. Sometimes while in school we
took time out to help people carry the luggage to the deportation points. Actually the beginning
of the deportation. People received the notice you were deported such and such day. You
have to give a list of your belongings. A certain day somebody came, sealed the apartment.
They had to go to the nearest collection point.
>> Bill Benson: In fact, you had a very frightening experience when your mother tried to help --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us that.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: My mother helped friends to the collection point. The Gestapo: What are
you doing? You're helping Jews. | bet you have a Jewish family. You have to report
tomorrow downtown at so-and-so at the central collection point.
Well, the next day my father and | reported. It was a former foreman. We were put in

a room with six men. The Kommandant was a notorious Vienna Gestapo captain known for
his brutality. We were forbidden. Nobody is going to lie down during the day. We did it

anyhow. But we were never caught. And why not? The building guarded by regular police.
They came around whenever the Kommandant, "Get up, get up; he's coming." Remarkable.
Had they been caught, they would have been sent to the eastern front.

After a week or So somebody came and said had to report in 10 minutes for
interrogation. My father and other gentlemen prepared me. Don't be a hero. Don't show signs
of hostility or contempt. Answer questions firmly but do not volunteer anything.

When | got there, sitting behind his desk five, 10, SS in the proceedings. Threatened
to cut me. Your mother is Jewish. | said my mother is Aryan. Well, they asked me some
questions: What are you doing with the shop? | tell you something, you come over here, got a
decent Jews for job. Out.

Out | went. To my surprise | found my father. And he stepped outside. | remember it.
In 1943, my 16th birthday. But actually it was the first time | had a run-in. | was working at the
company that made instruments. | don't know what they were, probably for the Air Force.

In the morning, the guard sitting there with the stuff. Suddenly the door opens. SS comes in.
"Take your coat. Outside." Ok. Waited. And then came the officers. Tell the driver to get the
truck here.

| remember this moment because to call the driver he used a very pretentious term,
power driver. The truck came. We had to go on the truck back to the SS. We were driven
downtown. We wound up in what was a kind of dance hall, entertainment center. Tables and
chairs were pushed aside. We were lying in the middle. | don't know for how long. It was
actually something.

Saturdays was half a day work. The workers -- they were sitting at home. You can't
imagine they wondered what happened to their children. We were there for hours. And after
that, my friend and | were interviewed by some men acted quite nice. "Get out of here. We
don't want Jews in here again."

Well, we are lucky. We stepped out. And by doing so, we broke the law because of
the curfew, 8:00. We shouldn't have been outside after 8:00. This was a law. It was not
written down. People went to the police and said | have to have permission to visit my father in
the hospital. A special pass. Didn't Know what | was talking about. | went home. My mother
just was away visiting her aunt. Said it would be nice if you would come home. My father was
picked up elsewhere and sent to another collection point.

Well, end of the month, ration cards had to be picked up. Usually my mother did it but
| had to do it. We went to the ration card office. There was a moving truck there. They drove
us to another collection point. It was the synagogue where | had been bar mitzvahed.
>> Bill Benson: Your synagogue was now a collection point?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: It was years before where my bar mitzvah had been confirmed. There we
stayed for half a day. And then another van -- another open truck. We were sent to another
collection point. It was Rosenstrasse. It was an administration building of the Jewish
congregation. There they put us in a room with 10, 50 men. Just enough room to lie down.
And there we spent our time speculating what would happen to us and lining up to use the
facilities.

Of course the building wasn't made up for an influx of people. | guess food, | don't

remember when, 4:00, got breakfast, turnips. After days | was told | was being released. To
my surprise, | found my father. | didn't even know he was there. Thought he was elsewhere.
We were released together. The secretaries from the Jewish agency had a slip. We were to
present it to Sergeant Schneider, the Kommandant of that facility. So my father -- said we had
ruined the lives of many people. “Well,” said my father, “I don't know.” And we stepped out.

Then what we didn't Know, while we were inside there was a demonstration. Several
hundred stood outside, demonstrated. You fight the police. You fight the Gestapo. And from
the diary of rebels, propaganda, in the diary he says, well, let's not do anything now. We can
do later much better. Particularly in 1943, right after the Battle of Stalingrad.
>> Bill Benson: Just so our audience knows a bit more about that. At Rosenstrasse you said
that was the only -- the non-Jewish wives staged the only public demonstration during the
entire --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The only challenge of authority, only time.
>> Bill Benson: And there's been a movie made about that. Right?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. They came right back.
>> Bill Benson: Rosenstrasse.

During this time -- you were telling us about of course Berlin was being bombed
regularly and lots of rubble. You were forced on a whole variety of work details that you had to
do during that time.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Was your father doing the same?

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. We were assigned work details; actually the beginning not the
same, different details. One of the details was quite interesting. We called it a game.
Scientists, businessmen, course of human nature. With three other classmates and the other
workers were afraid we would forget everything we had learned. They started to test us. Now,
remember one case | had to remove debris with a wheel barrel. While the wheel barrel was
filled | was given questions, geography, whatever, which | had to answer when | came back.
>> Bill Benson: You were given the question. You dumped the wheel barrel rubble, and you
had to have your answer when you came back.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: When | came back, | had to give the answer. | still remember one
question. When you come back, give the names of the Great Lakes of the United States.
[Laughter]
Of course, you all knew.

And, of course, taught us something else. They taught us to explain the vulgar
language that was bandied around because the other workers with the truck. It was very
helpful. Because later when | came to the states, | walked in a refrigerator company and
said -- [Speaking a language other than English]. And a nice fellow taught me words hoping |
would use it. It didn't work. Because one of those words of Anglo-Saxon origin is very similar
in German.
>> Bill Benson: These work details, of course, they were incredibly hard work, taking down
damaged buildings and all of that. At one point you were forced -- as part of this, you were
forced to do something that was referred to as a catastrophic mission.

>> Fritz Gluckstein: That was right. We were out --
>> Bill Benson: Of your own homes.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time we were in a Jewish hospital. Had to go to work every
morning. Suddenly, “Up, up.” The Gestapo. You could tell the guys the way they looked. In
the van. All right, in the van. Half an hour. Where we were, the headquarter of Eichmann.
Eichmann's headquarters had taken a hit. Eichmann was the driving force behind the
deportation.

| remember we left the van. A young SS officer pointed at me. “I want him. He looks
big. | like a big guy.” | was very lucky that | was assigned to him. Always behaved properly.
Never an antagonistic remark or slur. | don't know how he got into the SS. He didn't belong
there. All the others | see, some of the other officers -- a captain lived in the building. He was
barely civil but didn't live up to the reputation of one of the nastiest officer, Eichmann's deputy,
roaming around with a dog cursing at us; was standing on the balcony and gave directions.

Suddenly, "Eichmann is coming." Of course, we all know who Eichmann was. And |
wondered how he would look. | didn't know what to expect. Came. Ordinary. Nobody would
ever have noticed him in a crowd. Came up, stood right next to me, gave some instructions
and left.

At one time we had to remove debris from the front of the building. There were two
guards to watch us. One guard, a nasty guy, always cursing us and harassing us. The other
guard looked at us, never said a word. And whenever we took a break, he found something on
the other side. It was obvious. Made a point of not harassing us. Why? How did he get into

the SS? It was amazing even there two people, one hard and this ordinary soldier. Amazing.
>> Bill Benson: Fritz, of course, as you described to me as the war ground on, coming to a
close Berlin was bombed repeatedly, food was scarce, conditions got more and more difficult.
Under those circumstances at that point how did your family stay intact and do basics like eat
and stay warm?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, some of us worked on the house. We took window frames,
occasionally a beam, saw a beam in half. Nobody caught us. It would have been harsh.
And, food, well, find some bread. We had bread. The moist got into it. What did we do? We
cut off the ends to eat the bread. We knew someone in the country who could get some
potatoes. And my father knew a baker that helped, too.

And, of course, the stories helped, helped us. Let me tell you a couple of those. You
might like them. A Minister of Propaganda fell into a river, a river that goes through Berlin. A
young guy pulls him out. He says: Oh, my good friend, you saved me. What can | do for you?
Well, the gentleman said, I'd like a state funeral. Why a state funeral? Well, when my father
finds out, he's going to kill me.
>> Bill Benson: So very, very much dark humor here.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, SS, a Jew, I'm going to shoot you, kill you. But if you can tell me
which one of my eyes is a glass eye, | let you go. Oh, very simple. It's your right eye. How
did you know? Well, it looks human.
>> Bill Benson: So these were the jokes you would share with each other.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Something to start us. But they really helped.

>> Bill Benson: One of your jokes that | definitely want you to share, this came -- at some
point the Russians are right on the outskirts of Berlin. They're on the way. Now you're forced
to build defensive works against tanks. Tell us about this.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: We were dispatched to a location where we have to build foundations for
a new Berlin after the war. This was in 1944. Well, actually, for once we built something and
didn't break anything.
>> Bill Benson: Before you finish. There they are in essentially what's becoming the rubble of
Berlin, building the new Berlin.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The Russians are close. We're building a new one.
>> Bill Benson: A new Berlin.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | was building foundations for a new Berlin after the war. Then we were
sent to the southern part of Berlin to build tank barriers. We worked with beams into the
ground at a 35-degree angle and dug ditches.
>> Bill Benson: To stop tanks.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: To stop the tanks. Well, after hours we can go. Well, we looked at our
handy work and wondered: How long will it take the Russians to get through? One said: It
will take 31 minutes. The tanks, the Russians come, stop, the crew will laugh for 30 minutes
and will take one minute to get through.

Actually, that happened. Two armies attacked Berlin, east and the southern part. The
southern part got in so fast into Berlin. They couldn't get to the Jews. Thought it was a little bit
liberation of Berlin. We didn't do a very good job because of obstacles.

>> Bill Benson: As you said in the past, you survived because of your mother, luck, and
Martial Cognac for getting in so quickly.

| read, and other people have read, accounts on the Russian assault on Berlin and
what life was like as they came into Berlin and what life was like in that devastated city in the
months after the war. Tell us, if you can, what it was like for your own liberation, when you
knew that the war was over for you.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually, when did we know the war was over? One day, close to SS
barracks, what did we see? There was a line of trucks pushed by SS men. Well, what a sight.
| was delighted to see that. Really, the pleasure of somebody else's discomfort. We knew if
the SS didn't have gasoline, then the demise of the Third Reich can't be far off. We knew it
was over.

Well, | actually remember the Russians came in. At that time | actually was away
trying to get some bread. At that time nobody had their ration cards anymore. When | came
back, the Russians had arrived. Of course, didn't believe that | wasn't a deserter or a SS man.
A Jew? No. All Jews. Well, | showed them my card, my star, and other documents. These
together and one of the men who knew Russian, we explained.

When the war was over, we survived. We had the passes, of course. The
devastation on the street, houses flattened at times, no water or electricity. But after a while --
we were fortunate. They sent us to the suburbs, to a house. This was particularly fortunate
because we could plant beans in front, tomatoes and potatoes in the back. Food was quite
scarce.

Actually, Berlin, of course, was occupied by the Russians, the French, the British, and
the Americans. We were lucky to be in the American sector. You could tell each one's
occupying power, who was responsible for the feeding. If it was dark bread, it was Russians.
lf it was white bread, the Western powers.

Of course, after a while we got care packages. It was quite something. At that time
each package had everything from napkins to toilet paper. And most important were the
cigarettes. Cigarettes, if you had cigarettes, you had it made. And, of course, what brand was
important, too. They were all welcome, but Camel, Lucky Strike, and so on. But even gold
would not count. Couldn't do anything, black market. | still remember just before | got on the
boat to leave we were told: Ladies and gentlemen, remember, the moment you set foot on the
boat, a cigarette is just a cigarette.
>> Bill Benson: No longer currency.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Absolutely. | used it, later on actually. | wanted opera tickets. | have
some cigarettes. You've got them. But, of course, toughest ‘45, ‘46, a very difficult winter. But
you lived outside, as | mentioned, at the house in the suburbs. We went into the woods, cut
our own wood. But, of course, no electricity, and, of course, no water. The sewers didn't work.
You could bury the waste in the ground. But what about in the city? What did you do? Well,
not very delicate, but you could see people posting little packages in front yards and at the
parks. As long as it was cold, freezing, it was ok. But when it thawed, well, you can imagine
what happened.
>> Bill Benson: During that time after liberation and over the next months, at any point did you

or others that you knew, did you consider taking revenge, getting back at any --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Oh, yes, yes. “Just wait.” “When the time comes, we are going to get
you.” We are going to get the people who were watching. We were sitting and watching. At
times we covered up our star, camouflage. They came. “Yes. Oh, we're going to get.” We
saw those who were harassing us. We are going to get back. No, we didn't. We wouldn't
lower ourselves to their level.
>> Bill Benson: And, of course, you then eventually made the decision that would come to the
United States but your father didn't. Tell us two things. Tell us why your father and mother
didn't move with you and what advice he gave you about your career.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, the time came | went back to school. Can you imagine after three
years without school? It was quite difficult to go back to school. Some of my former
classmates simply couldn't do it, readjust to the schools. But | decided my place was in
Germany and | decided to immigrate to the states. We were given affidavit. | tried to go.

My parents, of course, it was quite difficult for them to let me go. But my father said:
Look, if we were 10 years younger, | would go with you. But what can | do? | can't practice my
profession over there. The law is completely different. Here it is based on old, Latin, Latin law,
and over there all English law. | cannot practice my profession. But for you, the future is in
America but | hope you will choose a profession that is not limited to one country, like law.
And so | did.
>> Bill Benson: And as you mentioned earlier, your 16th birthday you were being interrogated
by the notorious bruter of the SS, but your 21st birthday you spent on the ship coming to the

U.S.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: On the ship.
>> Bill Benson: You had decisions to make, all kinds of them, when you came to the United
States. One of them was about whether or not to change your name.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Correct.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your name itself and what that means.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, Knowing the company that sponsored us, provided transportation to
cities where the local Jewish organizations volunteered to assist newcomers. | was sent to
St. Paul. | had a choice between Detroit and St. Paul. | studied quite a bit of the physical and
socioeconomic history of the United States. | chose St. Paul. Minnesota, | Knew it would be
very cold in Minnesota but | didn't realize that it had only two seasons: July and winter.
[Laughter]
But | went to St. Paul. | thought, what shall | do? Change my name, Fritz Gluckstein? Well,
Fritz, | looked at the St. Paul phone book. Oh, there are quite a number of Fritz. | keep it.
And Gluckstein, Gluckstein actually -- well, Gluckstein means good luck. | always had good
luck. | kept it.
>> Bill Benson: You kept it, the good luck name.

| Know our time is getting short, but | want to -- you love opera. You watch football
and listen to opera. Tell us about listening to your very first opera during that time in Berlin.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. We lived in one room. Of course, Jews were strictly forbidden to
have radio, but | had a little, what you call the head phone -- under my bed.

>> Bill Benson: That didn't require electricity.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: It was strictly forbidden but | had it anyway. Every night | listened,
mornings. There would be an air raid, the enemy planes. One night there would be an opera
broadcast. | had heard pieces of operas. If there is an air raid, | am going to listen for half an
hour. Well, | put on ear phones and listened. Listened in German. It was an opera. | could
follow quite well. And half an hour, | didn't put it away until Tosca had jumped over the walls.
It was first time | actually heard a real opera.

Actually, at the time the Germans were quite advanced. It was all taped. | went out
and bought a tape of exactly the same opera | had listened to.
>> Bill Benson: | was -- in your book | was really amazed as you talked about when the
allies -- the occupying allies began rebuilding Berlin. One of the things they did encourage
was cultural events. So opera became available fairly quickly. There you were trading your
cigarettes; so you had gotten your rations for opera tickets.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time the first train downtown to get second balcony tickets.
Because | didn't always have enough cigarettes. | am an opera buff. | tell you. You know
what my e-mail address is? Opera.buff@verizon.
>> Bill Benson: You're going to be available when we finish for you to sign your book. You
just wrote this in the last couple of years. Recently what has this meant to you to finally put
down some of what you experienced in a book?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually, | realized how lucky | have been, how fortunate. What happened
to all of my relatives and friends, | have been very lucky. It really came to mind.

>> Bill Benson: It's really quite a read. | must say.

We don't have time for questions today. | know that when Fritz is done, he's going to
run up there or as quickly as he can to be able to sign copies of his book. That will be an
opportunity if you have a burning question to ask him or just to say hi to him. Please do so.
I'm going to turn back to Fritz in just a moment, but first | want to thank you for all being with
us, for being with us on what happens to be our final First Person program of 2014 to remind
you that we'll do this again in 2015. If your travels bring you back to Washington, D.C. or if you
live locally, we hope you'll come back to First Person. The Museum's website will have
information about our program in 2015.

It's our tradition here at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So
before | turn back to Fritz to close the program, | want to remind you again that he will be
signing copies of his book afterwards and also that when Fritz is done, I'm going to ask you all
to stand and our photographer, Joel, will come up on stage and take a photograph of Fritz with
you in the background. It just makes a wonderful picture to memorialize Fritz's presents with
us today.

On that note, I'm going to turn back to Fritz to close our program.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: It was my good luck, my good fortune, to have come to the United States.
I'm forever grateful for the help | received and the opportunity given to me. | value my
American citizenship most highly.

I'm often asked what | have learned from my experience. And my answer is always
the same: Don't do to others what you don't want done to yourself. And then | say: Seize the
