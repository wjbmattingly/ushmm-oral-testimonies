May 8, 2013

A: I think that I’m — I gained much from — from them, from the teaching, or wi —

they were very moral people.

Q: Were they religious?

A: They were religious and they attended the church as we — although, when I

started going to the — the primary school, it was a public school, but they were also

— sometime the — the schools run by nuns, or the — for the girls, or for boys, the

monks. But I was in public school, but we had also gone through a — learning

religion in school, and attended all — part of our life was living also a religious life.

And all our morals are based on that, and I think that — that added to the strength

afterwards, that we, when difficulties started later in life, and the tragedy started,

that the — the base was that we had loving parents, and my mother would — although

I always felt that she preferred my brothers to me, she was very strict — stricter with

me. It’s only when I was grown-up, much grown-up, she — she told me that she

expected more from me, and was stricter with me because the women have harder

life, and have much more to depend on the moral self-awareness than the boys. So

there — therefore, difference that I felt as a negative thing, was in the form of trying

to make me stronger.

Q: Do you think it worked?

A: I think so.

Q: Yeah. Which — which parent were you closer to?

A: I was close to my mother because she was always around. But I was also — I

knew that I was in — in ma — in the eyes of my father a little princess. I would —

wouldn’t do anything — even he expected also a lot of me. Fortunately I was a good

student, so there was never this — any conflicts like that. But I remember once she

wa — he was passing by my — our bedroom, and a rug that was near my bed was

crooked. And I remember him telling me, you, with your artistic inclination, how

can you stand a crooked rug? And tha — you know, that must have been so many

years ago, but something like this happened. And I was very proud of my father, he

had been — ha-had many friends, and was considered quite an — outstanding as a

person.

Q: Was he an outgoing person?

A: I would say he was more like home person, whenever he was coming. He was

not too much into going out so much, but usually when he would come home, I

would remember him reading newspapers, and staying home, and — and also going

visiting with the re — other relatives. But he was also very much feeling responsible

for his subordinates. So he was always on the lookout, or checking out with them.

So I understand they had a great admiration for him, which proved later on in life,

when they were looking for him.

How would you, when you think back on those years before the war, what is the

feeling that you have?

A: I would say, on — like most other girls, I would say similar experiences in school.

I was sometimes teacher’s pet, so I suffered a little bit sometimes, because being

somehow shown as a— an example, makes you an enemy of some people. But

anyway, mostly a good, pleasant type of fa-family, my mother and father, and also

the distant family, aunts and uncles visiting, everybody will — even later on they,

when as an adult, and some aunt, or some uncle from — from Poland, when we

visited, they remembered me as a child. And I remembered how close they were to

our family. So it was a, I would say, more — mostly [indecipherable] except that we

were not rich, because the army people are not rich, so I knew that from time to

time they might have had some problems, financial problems if something extra

happened. But I, fortunately, I don’t remember any big sickness in my childhood or

my brothers’, except for scarlet fever and diphtheria. But at that time there was a

kind of — every — every child almost, had it, and you had to be in the hospital,

because there was epidemic of scarlet fever, so that they would not allow children

to stay home. So I spent some six weeks or something like that in the — 1n the

hospital, but — my brothers, too, at different times. But nothing really tragic.

consequences.

Q: Did you have close friends at school?

you know, just rising from the ashes. And I think in Poland was starting to build the

economy and industry. So it — a regular situation with the army, it’s — wasn’t that

something, a presentation or something. It’s not that we’re poor.

Q: No.

A: I didn’t feel the poverty.

Q: Okay.

Q: Did your parents talk about politics at home? About what was going on in the

country, what was going on in the world?

A: I-I—I think we were well informed, but there were — I had sometimes discussion

with my father, what I was like — about medicine, or about something. I that — when

my father would come and have his late lunch, because at four o’clock it’s neither

lunch nor supper. So I would sit and ask of — my mother was very upset. Will you

stop talking about all the medical things, or — I don’t know why it was of some

interest at one point for me. But we discussed probably because of school, and

learning and it wasn’t somehow forced on us, any patriotic things, or you were

ordered by school to march, or to — ordered by — you did some of the things, like

celebrate anniversaries and — and ho — hope that Poland 1s honorable with

overhearing what they went to the — to shop, or where they went in — in the

A: No, there was definitely a well-known situation, and I remember during one of

my last — maybe not last — in 1938, in vacation, I was in Warsaw with my aunt and

uncle, the brother of my father. And I also lived with — sometimes they had the

then also sometimes on the radio too, you heard the [indecipherable] repeating his

threats after Czechoslovakia and starting to repeat the threats against Poland,

which some reporters translated it, of course. But also you heard the voices of

Hitler, it still to my — I think to my dying day, the wor — hearing his voice raises the

hair on my back of my head.

Q: Frightening.

A: Frightening, and like if you hear evil, or f— almost subconsciously because at

that time we didn’t realize what will happen. But the hatred that was coming

through was so difficult to — even to understand, that — that amount of threats, or

that amount of hatred, or that amount of — and also, on the other hand, my father

had a very relaxed or — the way of talking about the army, and about that Poland is

preparing for difficult times, and we are sure that we will survive, and also would —

toward the end, when there were the alliances with England and France, that we’ll

have some help and some support from the west, if Hitler will attack us. And that

be safe, that things will be okay.

A: Feeling.

Q: Yeah.

A: Feeling hope, and also based on the — our faith, religious faith, and feeling that

we were not the people who could cause the war, but rather to defend our honor, but

not to kind of being afraid that we are facing such a mighty enemy, and such a

ruthless enemy. So unfortunately, this happened. But it still, from what I

understand, the Germans, when talking about the September war, 1939 war, in their

reports said that some of the bravery was enviable, about Poles before they died, or

before they had to leave the post, or something. That’s all, there were still

when I came back from my aunt, near Krakow, where I spend the vacation, she

brought me around sixth or fifth of August. And I knew that the — at that time there

were some unpleasant meetings between the German and Russian people,

diplomatic, some conferences or whatever, we didn’t know yet at that time. And

because that war seemed to be imminent, my aunt and uncle brought me home to

Lvov. And by then my father was not sleeping at home, but staying on his post

where he was assigned at part of Lvov, at Lychakiv, near where his whole unit was

at. And my mother took me on the first of September to say hello to my father,

because this was around — like around 10 o’clock or so in the morning, to greet

Tadeusz after coming back from vacation, and to say hello, to see him, but then

return without him, with my mother. And I was returning by tram number one. That

I remember too, the tram number one was actually traveling from nearby where my

then we hear some of the bombs breaking sound, and the — the conductor of the

tramway said, you have to hurry home and try to get into the basement or

somewhere to hide, because this is the — we are attacked from the air by Germany.

I remember then walking back, I saw a woman — I don’t know how I remember that,

wha-what kind of news could come while was in — in wartime is very difficult to

say what is true and what not. But at that time, 1n a sense, we were puzz — Poles

were puzzled: why the Russians come? There was an alliance between Poland and

Russia in 1933 — 32 first, and completed in ’34 for non-aggression pact. So

supposedly we were free on the east, but unfortunately, the Russians broke it. To

this day they say there was no war. So, for example, the prisoners of war who had

been killed, are not recognized the victims of the war to that kind of — some kind of

the defense that Russian would, after finally admitting that it was Russians, at first

they said th-the — the German forces came with the po — the Russian prisoners of

war who are in Russia. But at that time there were no Germans in Russia.

Q: So, if there was a bombardment of — of Lvov, and all of a sudden it becomes

quiet, how do you explain that? Did the Germans retreat and allow the Russians to

come in?

you saw the Russian army come —

A: Immediately.

would get everything out, and I don’t know whether to take to Russia or to feed the

to Tarnopol, which was like closer to the Russian border — Ukrainian, but actually

it was Russian border, and — about 200 miles or so, and they were put on the trains

there. And from what I know the story, later on that I learned, but only in

Kiev, that a — a—a-—a letter — a small — a small card, that they were promised that

they could write once a month on the card. No letters, but just a card. A-And he

interpreter, and also he was the driver of the truck, and he was upstairs, and he was

trying to tell me don’t worry, don’t worry, you are going where your father is, so

hour later, or maybe less, we heard this bang on the door with pistols, or whatever

hard things, they kicked the door. And so we — or, I was awake, because my mother

communists who were, as they expressed it, they were waiting to go to paradise,

you know, Russian paradise. So, at that time, the — there was eight men and one

woman, a wife of one of them. And she realized that my mother didn’t know — she

wasn’t dressed. The soldier for bed — forbade my mother to close the bathroom

door, that she could dress and no — get all together that we could dress. And he

stood at the door, open door, and they wouldn’t give us any keys to the attic, where

we had our luggage, that we could use it. They were afraid to leave us without the

believe, she realized — she took the capes, or covers of a bed, spread out and put

some pillows and some clothing. She opened the shelves of some of the chest —

chest of drawers, she took some of the things and threw in, and tied it as a bundle.

one point in 1940, in the spring of 1940, some shooting and — but they couldn’t

to — you planted trees in a very orderly manner, and new grow — growth, and they

started digging. And they opened Katyn. So the news started on the 13" — can you

imagine the coincidence — 13" of April of 1943, when Germany was withdrawing

from Russia, the Germans were talking about finding people and giving the names

because they had the papers of these people, and they inquired — asked for the

international Red Cross, from the people, where some American prisoners of war

were being taken and shown it. There was a very famous person from Italy, who

was some scientist, who was asked to be the witness as they were recovering this

close to 4,000 bodies lying in there, but — and there was a question, when did it

happen? And the Russians res — in response to that — we are already out of Russia,

so we don’t know exactly Russian news, but the Russians are insisting that this is

Goebbels’ and Hitler’s policy to break up the friendship between Russia and

England, who are now allies. And they are reading openly on the radio in Krakéw

government, independent Poland.

Q: Yeah, yeah, mm-hm.

A: So that started writing books and news spread out. But by the time ’43 — must

have been toward — well, ’40, I was, by then already in Africa, in the camps, but out

of Russia, and out of Persia, and in Africa. So it was — it took another year and a

half when I saw a small — not leaflet, a small bic — bulletin, with the pictures of

these — of what happened, and — but it was only of Katyn — Katyn, and the names

did not bel — not — we did not get the list yet, 1t took years after. But from what I

understand, this was the only camp that was discovered by the Germans, and that

had the name of Katyn, but then afterwards, in 1990, when Perestroika started,

Gorbachev brought the letters showing that there were the camps of Starobilsk,

which was in Ukraine, and Ostashkov, which was little bit north of Smolensk,

where more of a police — Polish police, the pre-war Polish police was there, there

were about 6,000 people. He gave that — that — the Polish people knew what

happened to these prisoners of war.

bodies to the place, like Plakihatki(ph), which is a small surrounding, supposedly

luxurious woods, and dachas, Russian dachas, and that was what later proved to be

a big cemetery also for the Ukrainians from the previous persecutions. And — but at

that time, we had the list, because they came with the list, also who was in the ca —

in those camps.

Q: Okay. But they came with the lists only after Perestroika, in 1990?

A: I suppose so. That was —

Q: Okay, so in other words —

A: — only the German — the — we d — didn’t get any documents about other camps.

There were suggestions that near — that some children playing in some small town

near Starobilsk found the Polish uniforms, buttons, you — officers’ buttons, and —

and — so somehow there was, you know, gossipy kind of things, but sometimes this

was built on the truth, but somehow you couldn’t believe it because it was half

quiet, you could not repeat that very much. If you would repeat that, you would

was putting the names from just the Polish sources, the names who might have been

in these camps, he lived in London. My mother lived in lon — London at the time,

to express, like a tragic situation when you can imagine thousands of people being

thrown out of their houses, whether with some luggage, or not luggage, but taken

religious songs. And crying, you know, kind of — you know, you could expect the

people of — 1n despair. So that started our three weeks of travel.

Q: What was with you and your mother and your brothers? Were you — did you get

a bunk?

A: We got the bunk. I was on the upper bunk, and below was the — I don’t

in, because I was on the upper, and was my mother, my brother slept on the third, I

think. I— I really do not — it’s a blank. But very often I spend the time with

Richard, looking through the grated window, small window in the — in the wagon,

and, you know, talking and describing. We were — he was, you know, a young boy,

I was 12 years old, but I somehow was interested in many things. We kept a kind of

a friendship on — during that ride.

Russians widened the tracks because Poland had the tracks like western Europe —

remember Kiev. I remember some — some other — if I look at the map, Fufond(ph),

and we coming to the Ural mountains and then Magnitogorsk, which is a center of

Russian industry, steel industry, and — and then the Omsk and Tomsk. But this was

Q: Wagon.

A: — wagon. And it’s only after some days maybe, when we reached Ukrainian side,

they would let us go and relieve ourselves sometimes, but if we were passing a

place that there were like bushes around, or — or trees, or [indecipherable]. But

otherwise they were, you know, hurry, hurry, hurry, and they would bring — usually

on the train. So some people were lucky, or had been clear-minded, that they had — I

remember my mother said that she left the cooking of the tripes from the previous

day, because it’s a two days’ meal that you have to prepare, and I didn’t like it, as a

child. Oh, good thing my mother didn’t take it, because I wouldn’t eat it. But that

was at the beginning. And then afterwards, one woman had the can of tripes, and

she opened it, and she gave it to the children, one spoon each. And it was so good.

Until I reached — really, I reached America, when some of the Polish people having

their parties, and they had the tripes and I could finally feel — and we had also one

woman who was quite elderly. She must have been in her 90s. She was alone, but

she had a nurse taking care of her at — at home. She was a daughter of some man

who lived in our apartment house, above — across from us, who was arrested by —

because I — during these months, there were constant arrests, people taken to

prisons, all that. As a matter of fact, on the — December eight, which is my birthday,

we visited my uncle, who was retired general, and my aunt was crying. Why”?

Because day before they arrested him and took him to prison. And as a matter of

fact, he was also one of the victims, but of another — in Vicovnya(ph), which

recently was opened up on the Russian, near Kiev, that it was the prisoners, who

were not prisoners of war, but prisoners who were taken to full prisons. When the —

Germany attacked Russia, Russians were in panic, and were taking all trains and

all the families, because they had moved the families back to Poland. And so they

didn’t have enough room to take prisoners to Russia, and they would shoot the

prisoners and throw them through the windows of the — of the prison, and from

what I know from eyewitnesses, that they were one level, or two levels high, dead

bodies, the Russians killed some of the things. And I know that was — Brigitki was

the name of the prison. And my uncle was in Brigitki, but I — of course, we didn’t

know these things, because by then when — when Germany attacked Russia, we

were already in Russia, in Kazakhstan, so we were too far, so we didn’t know

what was happening. But anyway —

Q: There was an old woman on the train who had a nurse —

A: And her son was arrested, and many, many more people who were owners of

A: Intelligentsia was, of course, who — the enemies of the Soviet society.

depended, of course, on the individuals, but they were also the enemies of the

societies, some lawyers, some doctors were taken into the camp. I didn’t — this

woman, the banker’s wife was Jewish and Richard was Jewish. But that was

somehow an — just occurred to me later on that they must have been Jewish because

of — for some reason, I don’t know what made me think about it, that — that I —

somebody said that the father was Jewish, so I thought that the family was Jewish.

But they were on the same — in the same truck, and there were some of them taken,

although there was also a lot of these people like this, who were located in our

apartment, who were waiting to go to Russia.

Q: I see.

A: Some free on the — you know, getting to — to the paradise —

A: And what I remember, she was already s-senile, and she kept on crying, water,

water, water. She wanted a drink, and we didn’t have too much of that luxury. And

with her the situation was different because this woman was not her relative. But

when the NKVD came to take her, they wouldn’t take her as a nurse. She said, I am

her cousin. Then they took her on — that she swore that she is her cousin, to take

care of this woman. So she went willingly —

Q: Wagon.

A: And then we arrived on the first of May at Zhangiztobe. We went through the

Ural mountains, Omsk and Tomsk, and then Novosibirsk, if you know a map,

from Novosibirsk, which in my eyes was beautifully lighted and was considered a

showplace of — the Soviets were showing off, and we were not allowed, of course,

to walk on the station. And stayed there for several hours, and then we went down

to Semipalatinsk, which is entering the Kazakhstan.

Q: Okay.

A: And we came to Zhangiztobe, which is about 200 or maybe more miles after

Semipalatinsk, but this is same part, Tinskaya(ph) Oblast(ph). And fro — we came

no bridges, but the cart wheels broke on the river — within the river, and she fell into

the river, with her things. People saved her, put her back on truck. She came later on

to — to the place where they dropped us, and lived for another weeks, and died there.

Not knowing — she was asking her nurse, did you — did you correspond with the

hotel where we are going to stay? Because she didn’t know. She knew she was

going somewhere. And did you know what is it, the name of the place where we are

going? Because she — she — before the war, she traveled a lot, she was very —

probably a fairly rich family, so she was thinking she is going for a ride. So imagine

this woman, who took care of her, went with her. And when the woman died, she

put in a small — a small cemetery, what they made at the time, in the Cossacks —

mostly Cossack collective farms.

drink.

Q: Oh my gosh.

A: Then during the harvest, when the — that was a year later, and ow — the winter,

the — the snow that was two meters high, that was constant, constant snow falling

and cold weather, except that it was dry climate, so you didn’t feel that much of the

cold, as much as there was a lot of snow. The only thing, the Buran that came —

Buran was the name of the wind, special winter wind that brought the snow. You

couldn’t see — almost you couldn’t see your hand, it was so thick. But also, because

if you walked out, you got lost. So the people, to get — to go into real well, that was

in the middle of the — you know, a group of houses, had to tie themselves by rope to

go it — and to come back. Otherwise they would not —

cough. From what I can guess, that at that time, she covered her face with the

napkin, but the napkin was full of the small pieces of wheat.

houses you painted by making straw with some soil, with some dung also —

Q: Yeah.

three families, more detailed. And he, Allen Paul, asked us to speak. We were in

Washington, and several senators came, and Polish, you know, consulate — consul

and officials listened for it, and so I was started saying how we were taken to

Russia and that. And then at one point, I said, I have to stop here, suddenly, and

stopped this, what I’m talking about, and turn to real heroes of this thing. Imag —

now that I am a mother, because back then, it was in 1990 something, I already had

five children. Now that I am a mother, I can understand the tragedy of a mother who

is — doesn’t know where her — food for her children comes, where she could

exchange something for some food. You could, for a blouse you could get three

potatoes, or some — toward the end, the Russians themselves were hungry, so they

would give us a first chaff of wheat. So we burned the chaff on top of the stove that

was iron, and put in the water, so the water had the taste, and that was our soup that

we ate. And these things happened, and I — I didn’t say exactly at that time, but I

mean, this was a woman who, as you say, lost her husband, taken to unknown

country, thrown into un — inhuman conditions, and sees her children crying of

hunger.

A: So that the — this were us — really the heroes for all — children did not —

fortunately did not realize how hard things were, how the world is not made of nice

stories that you are used to, but situations are different. So children somehow are

more — somehow get accustomed to take the best of what situation is, and —

Q: That’s one of the things that helps kids survive.

A: Right.

Q: I want to pause just for a second. [technical discussion] Okay, we’re rolling. So

the harvest ends —

A: The harvest ends. The local people who belong to that kolkhoz get their parts,

what they earned, according to some — their judgments. But we, of course, don’t get

anything, except that during the year they would give us milk, which was taken —

cream, they would take off the milk the — how you call it, the plain —

Q: Right.

milk from that old cow, and nothing came. Had — anyway, the winter started, and

they said that the — because the harvest was not really poor, but they would

somehow let the horsed — the horses who were waiting with the carts to take the

wheat to the magazines in the big cities, or wherever they were taking, eat the wheat

while waiting. So what was left, they still had to put the taxed amount to the

government, and what was left, so very — I think they brought it on themselves to a

certain degree, that they didn’t have too much to share. And then they told my

mother they would not have work during the winter for women, and during the

spring. So they ordered my mother to go to the county hou — hun — county place,

which was about 25 or maybe 30 miles away, into Kokpekti, which is like

Hackensack here, or whatever, and — to find a job. They allowed her to take my

would hire the Cossacks with the cart, to take them to a distant cit — town. Not city,

a town, where they had so-called zwartaz(ph) kupka(ph).

son to that party, as a young man to — for having, you know, a chance to meet. And

she came also with a young woman, who was telling to this young woman’s mother,

and — mother, which I assumed that she must be daughter-in-law, because she turns

who were thinking along the lines that I was thinking, not carpe diem type of thing

Q: Yeah.

A: — not lightly look at — at life. Be of some use to humanity. Be a — a person who

has lived, but gave something of herself to the — to return for good, that somehow I

received from time to time, throughout these difficult times. And also, I wo —

maybe I always wanted something more serious, even if — I remember in small — in

the small grades they — that I wasn’t a flighty, stupid, young girl, who just from one

ice cream would go to a stupid movie although my parents would know where I

could go, or where I shouldn’t go. But anyway, I think that life is much more

serious than just to catch up, or a false fame by something —

Q: When you were in London, right befo — before you met your husband, and you

said you didn’t find any common language sometimes, and I wanted to ask you: did

you feel lonely? I mean, you had gone through such experi — [loud noise]

[technical difficulties] [break] I guess I wanted to wrap up the interview with,

what your final thoughts would be, and what you were able to maintain, and how

you felt you had changed, if you had changed. What final words would you want to

leave with people?

Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej

May 8, 2013

A: As I mentioned, and you suggested that actually I didn’t have childhood; I was

still standing mentally to a certain degree, or psychologically, a 12 year old girl who

had to sometimes face more difficult things, working to — to get something to eat —

Q: Yeah.

A: — or to help my mother to help us. That made me much more aware of

seriousness of life. And when I came to England, to — so to speak to normal life,

and went to London, and lived in London, met some other people, I still was not

hungry for light — kind of young teenagers like nowadays you see —

Q: Yeah.

A: — an — around, whether on television, or you met during that —

Q: Sure.

A: — stay in a— in England. I wanted to study. I was very close to my mother, and

somehow they si — some of the girls that I worked at the cook’s office, that I said I

worked after the second job in London, that I don’t know how you live like that;

you are so close to your mother; whether you will be able to get married, because

you won’t cut yourself off that closeness. But I — I think that was maybe this — and

maybe something of a un-conscience way of holding to something that holds me to

pre-war times, that holds me to my father, 1n a sense, to the time when I was —

Q: Well you had —

Interview with Maria Pawulska Rasiej

May 8, 2013

A: — somehow —

Q: Yeah.

A: — more serious looking at life, and also when — in the high school, I remember

that I developed that feeling that the teachers and the chairman of our — director of

our high school said, which was according to what I was thinking and what my

father taught me, that by your behavior, you are ambassador of your country. And I

never stopped loving Poland, and always thinking that maybe some ter — something

might happen, like the things that you did not plan happened, that you will go back.

And th —I will never got rid of my hope that — a-and longing for Lvov. And I

visited Lvov, then afterwards I visited twice or three times later. Lvov was very

neglected, and you could see the — kind of Ukrainians trying to cut all the traces to

Polandism, and I could not find the names of the street that I knew, because first of

all they were changed, but they were changed in the Ukrainian alphabet. So I didn’t

ever learn that Ukrainian, so — but I still had a feeling that I was walking on my

traces — tracing my steps, when I was going to school. I visited — my school was

taken by — over by Ukrainian high school, but the — next to it was the — the boys’

school before the war, which now they united the girls’ school and boys’ school,

Polish, one of two schools in Lvov, which is Polish, and Polish teachers, very high

level of learning, and when Ukrainians are sending —

Q: Their children there.

A: — children there, because they have the chance then to go to Poland, to the

universities. More — it’s easier for them because Lvov University ha — is

overflowing by the people from the villages, or from —

Q: Of course.

A: — other parts of Russia or Ukraine.

Q: Yeah.

A: But this thing and — and the sense of value and sense of feeling responsible, that

whatever you do, it somehow influences the lot of many people that —

Q: That you have an effect.

A: It has the effect, or somehow if people would talk to each other. My — my son,

the oldest son, when there was some boys who, as I told you, being of — having

foreign name here in — in America too, that — that they — sometimes he was the

victim of a bullying, and so to speak, and when they — they came to our house, and

through — through the window, the bags — baggies full of water. So they attacked

my br — my son, and he wanted to go out and start fighting. And I said no, you have

or sa — something on that —

Q: Yeah. That you don’t — you don’t answer in the same way that you are being

attacked.

A: Right.

Q: Yeah.

A: You don’t lower yourself to the same level, if somebody unreasonably attacks

you —

Q: Yeah.

A: — for whatever reason. You only lower yourself as a human being, responding

the same way.

Q: Well, Mrs. Maria, thank you. Thank you very much, for sharing so much.

A: You’re welcome, and thank you very much for your understanding, and your —

the questions that you put, trying to, somehow, to understand how I tick, so to

and all I can say is what you have done today is given us a real gift —
