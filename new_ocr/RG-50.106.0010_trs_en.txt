A: That’s right. My father --
Q: What is the first change. The first change that you remember, that life was a little
different.

A: Yes, mm hm. And well things didn’t go very fast in 33, nothing really happened. I was
still going to school. My father still did his business. It was just in the later years it you know
that they began to extinguish between the Jews and the non-Jews. And I remember going to
school, even so they let me go to school with other kids that were not in my school would spit at
me. Because I was a Jew and they would call me dirty Jew and they would spit at me. Well you

along very well. when the first, one of the first things that we saw was when one morning my
father had a plaque on the door with his name and his profession on there. It was shattered. And
I think that might have been the time that they told us that he couldn’t do his business any more.

aunts and we would go on weekends, like in a Sunday morning we would get in the car and visit
with grandma and grandpa and my aunts. Stay there for dinner and come home. And that, that
was natural for us. I mean we were used to going to Holland and when I was little I would go on
vacation and stay with my grandparents and my two maiden aunts in Maastricht. And you know
for me it was just nothing special.
Q: Did you tell the nuns you were leaving?
A: Yes.
Q: What did they say?
A: They would have liked to have gone with us. Because they felt just as unsafe as we did.
And oh yes, they would have loved to have gone to Holland. But at that time to go to Holland it
was like a haven. It was a safety, not knowing that they came after us, but at that time for us it
was a haven. And for me, for us to go to Holland we were used to going to Holland.
Q: Were you a witness to any anti-Semitic incidents in Germany, not to yourself. You said

A: Ok, my father came of a family of eleven. Seven brothers, there were seven brothers and
four sisters. And 19, one died, Robert died of a natural death. He just got sick, I don’t
remember what he died of. But he died in Germany of a natural death. The others were all still
in Germany. My father always said I’ve never done anything. I’m an honest citizen. I he was in
World War I, he was a soldier. I don’t want to leave. He absolutely did not want to leave and
none of them wanted to leave. They were all very, they were merchants. None of these people
ever went to college or school. In fact my father only had a seventh grade education. He had to
go to work because he was an orphan at that time, already. And very few left Germany because
they said why should we leave. We haven’t done anything and we’ll just stay. There was only
one aunt. She was a widow because her husband got killed in World War I. She and three of her
children went to Brazil. And that is really one of the few families that stayed intact, because they
left Germany.

A: The, well the summer came. I went to school and then on Kristallnacht it was when they
took all the Jewish men in, in Germany. But they took my brother in law to Dachau. And my
sister was all alone at that time. The only good thing was that my brother in law had blood
relatives in America whom they had been in contact with. And they started to work on papers to
get my brother in law and my sister out of Germany. My brother spoke English. And he and the
family here in Brooklyn worked on the papers and got them ready just before the war broke out.
This is one of the few cases where I’ve heard that the Germans let a person leave the
concentration camp to come to America. And this happened to my brother in law. They let —

grandmother was at the time. They destroyed the SS or whoever came in the house, destroyed
everything in the house. There was not a chair to sit on. there was not a cup to drink out of. They
destroyed everything. But when they came to my grandmother’s bedroom, they opened the door
and saw this old lady and they closed the door and never touched her or touched that room.
Something else dreadful. My grandmother was 93 years old and she had sugar diabetes for a long
time. But that was old age which is not very bad. But in the meantime she developed gangrene in
her toes, her foot whatever it was. And the family held a, got together on the phone and they
decided that it was, this was not the time to have grandma operated on and have her sitting in a
wheelchair so they decided to let it go. And let grandma die. She was 93 years old. One thing I

floor of a store and again it was Orthodox with me sitting in front and the women sitting in the
back. it was a very nice but a very small Jewish community. but enough to have a little
synagogue and —

Interview with Ruth Greifer 28
A: Well that was in Germany. Let me go back to Holland since we moved there. Everything
went very smooth. I had my maiden aunts living in Maastricht which is another city close to
where we lived in Valkenburg. And my brother lived with us and he spent time with my aunts

you’re 18. I was not allowed to date til I was 18 years old. And I remember not being able, lived
in Holland. There was a dance and my father wouldn’t let me go, not even with my brother. I
wasn’t 18 years old. Very strict house.

A: Right and I went to school.

Interview with Ruth Greifer 30
A: Well until May 10" 1940 we got up very early in the morning, 5:00 in the morning and
the sky was dark, dark with airplanes that had come. And the Germans were coming in and
trying to overrun Holland which they did in five days. I remember the soldiers walking down
our street.
Q: German soldiers?
A: German soldiers. My mother was in the hospital in Maastricht. She had a my mother had
angina and she was there for a, for their own soldiers that got hurt.
Q: The Dutch soldiers?
A: The Dutch, the German soldiers.
Q: Oh the German soldiers.
A: German soldiers. I mean the German soldiers needed that room and set anybody that was
able to leave the hospital so you had to come home. That made, that was devastating. I mean
you had this poor woman that had a heart condition had to come home. We were scared. We
knew what was going to be. We knew what was coming and here we just left Germany in 1938
to be overrun again in five days. And that was the most frightening and experiences. One of the
most frightening experiences in my lifetime.

sometimes during those attacks we stayed in the catacombs. That people, there were people that
died in the catacombs. There were babies born in the catacombs but that was just across the street
from our house. In the, there were small mountains. Holland doesn’t have any mountains and
the little town where I used to live, Valkenburg, had the biggest mountain there is in Holland. If
you look it up in the dictionary it’s called aculvert. It’s, I mean you walk up, it’s absolutely

Q: Did you stay the five days in there?
A: Not quite. In and out, in and out, in and out yes. Because we didn’t’ have to stay there.
It was just across the street. If we would have lived far away we probably would have stayed
there for a while, but we stayed. Anyway we were very scared and —
Q: What did you do when you were scared. By this time you’re 18 years old
A: Well I was, you know I could, I was out of school. And what did we do. I really, oh no,

seamstresses because with the idea
Q: So now it’s those five days and then what happened.
A: And well nothing happened immediately but we’re here we are in 1940. But things
became changed very, very rapidly. We had to go and sign up I guess.
Q: Register
A: Register. Who were Jews. And so they knew exactly who lived where and how many
Jews there were in this little town. Then we had to give up our radios. We had to give up our
bicycles.
Q: Were you angry?
A: Scared. Angry. Why me? Why am I different. I’m not different than anybody else. I
think they took my dad’s business away again. They gave us stars to wear.

A: On my left side and we had to secure the star on every corner because if a wind would
blow then the star would fall over and it had to be clear that it had to be secured on every corner,
the star. All six points.
Q: Did you sew your own stars on.
A: No my mother did all that. I didn’t’ do anything. But my mother lined it so it would be
more sturdy and then she put all the pins on. I was a spoiled child. I didn’t do any of that.
Q: Were you upset to have to wear a star?
A: Yes, yes why would I be different than anybody else. I just didn’t’ want to be different.
Why should I be different than anybody else. We had curfews. We could not be out in the dark.
We could not leave town. We had to stay in town. We couldn’t’ move around. And it was
absolutely frightening. You had no more liberty. You had no more way of earning a living. You
were different than anybody else and scary. Very, very scary.
Q: Did you talk this over with your parents?
A: Yes we talked about it, but what could we do. There was nothing that we could do. In the
meantime I got postcards from my girlfriends from Germany who had been taken to
concentration camps. And what the postcard always said, it said only one or two sentences but
the sentences were always the same. So we knew that there were, if they wanted to write, they

were forced to write the same thing. But we didn’t know where they were. There was no address.
There was nothing on it. I could never return their postcards. And we were very, very scared
and frightened. A lot of my dad’s family was taken to a concentration camp and never heard
from again. But these were all older people already, people that didn’t’ want to leave Germany.
People that were of means. People that didn’t’ have anywhere to go or may even try to go
anywhere. Because they felt that this is where I live and I’ve never done anything wrong and I
don’t want to go anywhere. Well, here we are in 1941. And we have all these liberties taken
away.
Q: Did you have enough food?
A: Yes, yes that we had. We always had enough food in the house.
Q: How did you get the food, your father wasn’t working.
A: Imagine we had enough money to buy the food. I don’t’ remember what happened to our
car. I couldn’t tell you that. But we were told to get ready and pack knapsacks. For I don’t’
know how many days, clothing, food and everything so when the Germans come to our house

Interview with Ruth Greifer 36
Q: How?
A: I guess we got notices in the mail probably. It’s not all very clear to me anymore. But I
do remember one day in 1942, I think it was about June or July, 1942. There was a knock on our
door and they would come and to get me. In the meantime, I was sick. I got sick. I don’t know
how lucky I was that the doctor that we had in Holland told them that I could not be moved. And
I by a miracle they let me stay. I stayed in bed from months at a time, putting white powder on
my face to tell people that I was sick. I had to be afraid of my neighbors because some of my
Jewish neighbors were taken away and here I was as a young girl, 20. In bed. My mother did
everything. She, I would not get out of bed. My mother took care of the house as sick as she
was. And like I said it’s a miracle that they didn’t’ come after me at another time. But in the
meantime my two maiden aunts were taken away in Maastricht. My brother said I’m not going
to let these ladies go by themselves. They’re very frail. They’re old. They are absolutely the most
wonderful people who never hurt a fly. They were ladies of means. My grandfather was an
antique dealer. And I will go with them. He volunteered to go with them. Not knowing that he
was never with them because I found out later through the Red Cross that as soon as they came
to Auschwitz that they were killed immediately. And but my brother who went was young, he
was 11 years older than I was. He was sent to work camp. And I don’t’ know where he died but
I know that he lived through I guess work camps, concentration camps, til the end. And he died
either in Badwamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz. I am not sure. But he died
of typhoid of probably two days before he was liberated. So that was our oldest one in the
family.

Interview with Ruth Greifer 37
Q: So here you are in bed with white powder ---
A: With white powder on my face. Another time they came to get my mother but you should
hear the screaming and the carrying on and she was sick. And they did not take her either. I don’t
know what happened. They must have felt so sorry for us. That they let us stay. People were
taken away and people disappeared. We did not know what happened. My father had a friend in
another city. He also was a cattle dealer and he said, I don’t know how they got together. He
said how come that people are disappearing and he said if you go to the post office and there is a
gentleman and you ask for his fictitious name, Mr. Jansen, he will tell him that you want to
speak with him. We had been moved from our single house to a house that had a lot of stores
and a lot of rooms and they put all of us Jewish people there together. So if they had another raid
that they didn’t have to go from house to house. That we were just all there. I don’t’ know how
they moved me. I don’t’ remember anything but I remember having been moved to this house
where all these storefronts were changed into places for us to live. Well my father went to Mr.
Jansen and he told us that he could help us. that he would help us to go in hiding, if we were
willing to and my father said anything, anything you can do for us he did. Well of course it was
very difficult to find houses, to find places for us to go. He got in touch with us. It must have
been before another transport came. And he had found one place for the three of us but we never
wanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed.
The man came to our house and at night and got some, I guess my mother had suitcases ready
with a few little things for us to wear. I don’t’ even remember what I wore, what I had. I, I can’t
tell you. I really don’t remember. But I know that he came the night before or a couple nights

before and picked up a couple of suitcases and he said yes he had secured a place for us. We
had to leave early in the morning. I don’t’ remember. We had to go up the hill, but that was
during a time that we were not allowed on the street. We had to wear our star. And we walked
up the hill where he came with a car and took us away. You left everything, everything you
owned. Everything you had you just left behind because all you had were what you wore and a
few things I guess clothing that he took. I remember coming to this place and it was a coal miner
where we, where he wanted us to stay. It was a very small townhouse and the person made
secure to tell the neighbors that she was getting company for the weekend.
Q: This is 1942.
A: It’s 1942 already.
Q: What month or what time of year?
A: This was 19, I don’t’ know if this was already 19, the end of 1942, already 1943.
Q: So it was winter time.
A: Winter time. And well everybody was indoors so they just snuck us into this house but it
was a very small house and this person was a coal miner. And my father had the hardest time.
Having been an outdoor person all his life it was like you had a lion in a cage. My mother had a
terrible time with him because he had to be quiet. He couldn’t speak loud. I guess, I don’t’ even

remember he was used to smoking. I guess he couldn’t smoke. I don’t’ remember. My mother
really had an awful, awful time with him. But we stayed in this one house. He stayed, they
stayed in this one house I guess just for a few days until they found somewhere else for them to
go. My mother and dad. I never really saw them after that until after the war.
Q: What were your feelings when they had to leave?
A: Scared, frightened but —
Q: What did they say to you? When they had to leave.
A: Well we cried, we hugged each other but we had no other choice. You have, you are, you
have no idea how hardened you are during that time. All you do is think about your safety,
yourself, that you make it til the end if there is an end. And you just live from minute to minute
and day to day. You don’t know if you get caught while being transported. You don’t’ know if
you get caught. In the house. If the neighbors would hear something and they would go and
squeal on you. You really lived in fright, you were frightened 24 hours a day at all times. But so
were the people that you stayed with. Don’t’ forget, if they would have found us, they would
have killed me. They would have killed them. They would have killed the whole family. And

Interview with Ruth Greifer 40
A: No, absolutely not. that’s frightening about being old. I should have written 1t down
which I did not. I neglected.
Q: They did give you the names at the time.
A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, they knew my name. I knew their name. we lived a normal life.
The only thing is I had to fit into this life. I wasn’t used to eating rabbits which were free of
ration. And I remember in that particular house she made rabbit. Just the thought of it, coming
from a kosher home to eating rabbits. I wouldn’t eat it. and lo and behold I didn’t get anything
else. I was hungry, just smelling this rabbit and looking at it I couldn’t do it. But the next time
when she served rabbit, I ate the rabbit because I was hungry. We did get rations from the
underground. The underground did supply us with rations which was a big help. But this one
man helped us during the time, all this time, all the time we were in hiding and if we needed help
he would help us to find another place. And you know that this man never got paid, never he did
it all on his own.
Q: This is Mr. Jansen?
A: Mr. Jansen. And he was, he had, he was a single person who lived with a, he had a lady
that did his housework and she was in with this. because sometimes if you had to go, we knew
where to go. We knew where to go overnight if we needed help so I tell you, you were so
hardened. You had to live from minute to minute that you don’t think. You absolutely don’t’
think. but there was a time another girl came in.

Q: Your parents left and so you’re still in that first ---
A: I’m still in that first house. Then he needed the room for somebody else.
Q: Your room, he needed your room or your parents.
A: No he needed to, I was there and then he brought another single girl in. He, you know
sometimes you don’t’ have places and so there were two of us. Bu the people didn’t like this
girl. She was not clean. She was not friendly. She just didn’t fit and before we knew it they asked
her to leave.
Q: A Jewish girl?
A: A Jewish girl from Amsterdam, absolutely. I stayed there for a while and it was hard.
The air raids started to come in. And every time there was an air raid we had to be fully dressed,
fully ready to leave the house, run out for two reasons. Number one the when the air raids were
sometimes, airplanes would be shot down. There would be shot and the pilots and that were in
those airplanes would try to hide and would sometimes people would give them hiding places.
So if they were, there was an airplane that was down and the pilots were missing well we were
surrounded and if they would have found us it was just I mean they would have killed us
immediately. That went on for a while. But then the people got very nervous. They had me for a

while and they said enough of it already. You need to leave. Where did they send me? They
sent me
Q: Before you left did you do anything specifically during the day, not during air raids but
just generally. What did you do?
A: Just helped them in the house. But I had to be very careful that I could not be seen. And
not be heard. That the toughest thing is they had to lead a regular life. Remember they were
going for one day at a time. they were going to on a little vacation. Then I had to sit in the attic. I
had my food in the attic and I had my little potty in the attic and that’s where I stayed. I could not
move. I sat in this in the attic until they were ready to come home. because if they would have
heard noise then people would say well they’re gone for the day, what is who is in that house.
And by luck maybe they would have called the Germans. By luck they might have called
somebody and said well let’s go in there. you never know what other people’s minds are. So if
they were going, if they were going shopping, or they were going somewhere or doing anything
up in the attic I went.
Q: Did friends come over to visit them?
A: No, they never had any friends come over. I think they did have some family come over
but then they were aware of where I was and who I was. No. they never had any entertainment
or, they were plain people.

place for me.
Q: Were they getting paid?
A: Yes.
Q: From your father?
A: Yes.
Q: To protect you?
A: Yes. Nobody did anything for nothing. But look, it meant a whole lot of money for us.
But for them, if you take the risk that these people took and the agony and the frightening you
could not pay them enough. You wouldn’t be able to pay me enough to do it. you could not pay
them enough so this little bit of money really didn’t’ mean anything as long as everything went
well.

A: I contacted, we, they contacted Mr. Jansen and I don’t’ know if I went to this, let’s say I
don’t know in order where I went. But I went one time I went to a doctor’s house. It was a big
house and they had a maid. They used to have two maids but the one maid just left so they
needed a maid to be in the house. And well I wasn’t used to doing maid’s work. We always had
help in the house until the last minute we had help in the house. Well they told me what to do. I
had to go on my hands and knees to do the floors. And the other maid said to me and looked at
my knees. She says you don’t have maid’s knees. I said what are maid’s knees. She says you
haven’t crawled on the floor long enough to have flat knees. Well, I got scared. I told the owner
of the house that I had to leave. Because I didn’t’ have maid’s knees so she probably could figure
out that I wasn’t used to doing this kind of work. I remember I needed to leave immediately.
And this is one time that I walked over to Mr. Jansen’s house. I knew approximately where he
was.

RUTH GREIFER: Yes, that was like a little haven to be until the next house was available for us.
I don’t really remember who and how I got my clothing. It must have been that took charge of,
arranged for all of this. Well , here he took us. He took me to a house where my parents had
been and my parents had to leave because they were squealed on and the girl that squealed on
them was killed by the underground. Anyway, can you believe that after this had died down, that

they were willing to take another human being, another Jewish person to be in their house. Well I
came there.
Q: What were their names?
A: That was Mr. and Mrs. Robertson. And their only daughter Katie. The house was built
on the outskirts between two small towns. We didn’t have, we had only —
Q: Are we still talking about Valkenburg. Is that where you still --
A: No, I’m in. No the places that were, was in hiding 1s all in the vicinity of Hallen,
Hulsberg, Terblijt. These are all small coal mining towns. And this is where Mr. Jansen was
able to place us. Here, but ’m coming back to go to the Robertsons’ house. The Robertson
house was on a road that was between two, not cities, two small towns and they have never
gotten together. Who’s going to put in electricity. Who’s going to put in water supply. We didn’t
have any water supply except for a well in the back yard. And there was no electricity. We only
had kerosene and the only heating place in the house was the stove in the kitchen. It was very
primitive but the people were absolutely wonderful. I stayed there and we had another lady
German Jewish from Heidelberg. She was used to a lot of money. Her parents had a cigar
factory. And she was, she had a hard time being, adjusting, being the person. Nobody. You are
absolutely a nobody. You are at the mercy of people. If they’re good to you then it’s fine. If not,
it’s a hard time and a different way of life. Don’t forget a little carafe of water had to last us for
one week. I slept with Katie in a single bed. When she turned I had to turn. When I turned she

had to turn. Our linens was washed. The bed linens were washed every two months. Because
they would hang the clothes out and people would probably watch how often you wash. So they
were used to washing once a month so once a month this bed was being changed and the next
month this bed was being changed. Our clothing wasn’t changed for at least once a week. And
like I said our water, we had a little carafe that had to last us one week. But look, you do
anything to keep your life. I was asked once did you make plans. When you were in hiding and
they were so amazed. I said no I didn’t make any plans because I didn’t know if I was going to
live the next day or the next morning or the next minute. Because I didn’t know where I was
going to be. I didn’t know what was going to happen to us if I ever survived. We couldn’t tell.
The people were very good to us. The food was ample. We ate probably potatoes three times a
day which was fine.
Q: Do you remember the parents’ first names?
A: No, no. I know that he was a coal miner and a farmer and the woman didn’t’ work. And
Katie delivered the newspapers. That’s all I know.
Q: So you stayed inside the house?
A: Inside the house all the time. All the time.
Q: And what did you do there?

A: I knitted. I remember that they had knit sweaters and they would pull them out. And
then I knit them bigger for somebody you know for somebody else. This kind of stuff. People
asked me if I read. No. I never read. There was no reading material in those houses.
Q: What happened to your Jewish star that you had?
A: The Jewish star, I didn’t have it with me. That was back in Valkenburg with somebody
else. I never had it with me. I have it here but I don’t’ have —
Q: You left it with somebody?
A: I left it with somebody.
Q: So you’re with the Robertsons.

the, you know they were, the Germans were dug in, in front of the house. We Anna and I, Anna
is the other lady. We were downstairs and what we were doing downstairs I don’t’ know.
Anyway the German soldiers come in the back entrance and coming into the house. And here
we are. There’s the kitchen and here is the French door. And here is a round table and we could
not get out of that room to go upstairs. The poor soul asked these German soldiers in the kitchen

in the adjacent room. The adjacent room had a round table and long table cloth. Under the table

in the next room. You don’t know how frightened we were. You don’t know how scared we
were. If we had coughed, that would have been the end of us. They would have said who is in
there. Let’s go see. Because they’re aware. They knew that people were in hiding and they knew
exactly what was going on. You don’t’ know the fright and how scared we were. I don’t know. it
probably lasted three days to us but it didn’t last that long. I don’t’ remember how long it lasted.
But thank god we survived that particular incident. You had to live. They had to live a normal
life. And just fill in because people knew exactly how they lived. Friday mornings she would go
into town and buy her groceries. I mean everything had to be just so. The clothes that were hung
out had to be just normal. Not more, not one piece more than another because people in small
towns know exactly what the next person does. I really don’t remember how long I stayed with
them. Until I had to leave again. And I don’t know if they got scared of us. You know there’s
just so much time that you can spend with a person that’s a fugitive. I absolutely was a fugitive
in that house.
Q: They were also getting paid.
A: Yes, everybody.
Q: Everybody. Did you have contact with the underground there?
A: The, I tell you what happened. Well we at certain times we ran out of money. So the
underground would go back to Valkenburg where we had things and I don’t know got in contact

with friends of ours. I don’t know if they sold things or whatever happened. I really don’t’ know.
I never asked my father how did you get the money.
Q: This was the Dutch underground.
A: The Dutch underground.
Q: The Dutch Jewish underground just the Dutch underground.
A: No, there wasn’t a Jew in sight. Mm, mm. Just the regular Dutch underground. And then
I was transported pretty far away from Hulsberg to Treebeek. And I got into a house where I
was upstairs. And now I didn’t like it that much but I had no other choice. And in that house
also was another girl. And this girl had problems. She had polyps. And I think that they were
able to get a doctor in that house to help her. I don’t know if he operated in that house. I don’t
know whatever happened. But I know that I didn’t’ like it there but I had no other place to go.
And this was already close towards the end of the war. I remember being at Katie’s house. She
had a radio and we listened to the invasion. And we followed that but we didn’t know how long
it would take before the liberation came if there ever was a liberation. One didn’t’ know. But
that I know we had in Katie’s house.
Q: And that was June of 44.

A: Yes. Right. So here I am in Treebeek in this other house with more people and the
bombing got heavier. And I remember being so scared. Here we are and it was we didn’t know
how soon the liberation came. And I remember I was so scared that I went down in the basement
and there was a potato bin. And I crawled into the potato bin and I don’t know how often I sat in
that potato bin. And how long I sat in that potato bin. Because when the Americans came to
liberate us the house was in front of a big coal pile. And the Germans would sit on this side and
shoot over your house and Americans came across. It was a big field. I’ll never forget the
Americans came across with their tanks and infantry. And we were told to stay in the basement
because we didn’t’ know who was going to stay. Who was going to be pushed back. And I know
that a, some of the American soldiers got hurt. But do you know that we were afraid to come out
of the basement for days. We didn’t know if they were going to stay. We didn’t’ know if they
were going to be thrown back and but we did get liberated, September 17" 1944. That was early
but still scared. Absolutely frightened to death to even tell people well here I am. I’m Jewish.
I’m, I’m liberated now. I’m free. For three days we did not come out. We were scared,
absolutely scared, scared, scared. Then I gota call or we got a call from Mr. Jansen that my
parents had gone back to Valkenburg.
Q: You were still in the house.
A: I was still in the house. They already had gone. Well we didn’t have a place to go. We
did not have anywhere because the house that was rented was not ours. We didn’t —

A: First Americans. First Americans that I’ve , that Isaw. And
Q: What kind of things did they say to you?
A: I don’t even, I don’t’ even know that I told them that I was Jewish. I just was so, so
happy to be free, afraid. Don’t forget how long have I been afraid. How long have I been in
underground. How long have I been living with people, scared For 24 hours all these months.
There was not a wink that I could say I could smile. I could enjoy, I could live. It was will I ever
be able to be free. Will I ever be able to live. It was I don’t know. I guess I lived so intimidated
that I was scared. And to be free. There were so many questions. What happened to my family.
Oh god. What happened to my family. Ok. Mr. Jansen came and got me and brought me to my
parents. Well we didn’t’ know where we were going to live we didn’t’ —

Q: When you first saw your parents.
A: Oh my goodness.
Q: What were your feelings?
A: I couldn’t, didn’t recognize my mother. My mother did not eat. She could not stand the
thought of pork, bacon. She couldn’t stand the smell in the house. She wouldn’t eat. My mother
weight about 80 some pounds when she came out of hiding. And she was absolutely what shall I
say, devastated. Here we are. but she knew that my brother had left. Her two sisters had left.
Another sister with a husband and son had left. And she didn’t know what happened to them.
She wouldn’t eat. She just existed. And well my father, he, he was a different type of person.
They spoke with the family that owned this big house. And they asked my parents to move in
with them. That’s funny. We did not have a chair to sit on. We did not have a bed to sleep on but
what the Dutch government did, they went into the apartments that the Germans deserted, that
the Germans left behind and gave us furniture and beds and chairs to sit on and beds to sleep in.
And they gave us enough that we could live in this house. This young couple also was in hiding
but the elder couple, the elderly couple had been taken away. Of course they never returned and
let me tell you something, how people take things different than others. One day and I’m coming
back to the people that we lived with. I went upstairs in an attic to hang up clothing. Here this
young man who asked us to come and move in with them tried to hang himself. He tried to
commit suicide because his parents did not return and he had an absolute nervous breakdown.
Well we didn’t have a telephone in our house. I went to the doctor and he was committed for a

while because he had a complete nervous breakdown. Anyway we stayed in this house. Let me
think. We lived in this house. We didn’t have any windows in the house. The windows were all
broken from the bombs and there were all put together with wood. Let me think. Can you turn it
off.
A: All right, the transports were coming in. And
Q: You’re with your parents.
A: I’m living with my parents and the transports were coming in and my father still hoped
that my mother was alive. He would stand at the
Q: Train station.
A: At the train station all day long. From morning til night and when he found out
eventually he thought that my brother would never come home. My mother and I would go into
town to Maastricht where she was born and where my family used to live and we would go,
maybe we would go shopping. Or we would do something. And people would come and say
aren’t you the sister of the Dahl Miss basements. And she said they looked so much alike. And
let me tell you it killed her. My mother died literally of heartbreak because her older son, her
only son was killed in a concentration camp. Her two maiden aunts, sisters were killed. Her other
sister and the husband and son were killed. My whole Dutch family is not there anymore. I’m the
only survivor of my Dutch family. There is nobody left. The only ones that are left are at the
cemetery. And my mother is buried in Maastricht. And my grandparents and my great

grandparents. But I am the only survivor. I didn’t want to stay in Holland. I felt that as a Jewish
girl I didn’t’ have much of a chance. Even so, I had been begged to stay. They needed young
girls to marry Jewish men so there would be a continuation of the Jewish people in Holland. And
I said no I’m not going to do that. I am, my sister lived here and she was willing to send papers
for me to come to America. I don’t know one, sometimes I ask myself did I do the right thing to
leave my parents. But having been through so much in my young life that I felt that I wanted to
start a new life. Not really realizing how hard it is to start a new life. Because you turn a leaf
over and you start all over again. I left my parents. And I came to America.
Q: How did you get here?
A: Literally on the boat. I came over on the New Amsterdam. And as soon as I got off the
boat, the first word my sister said to me is speak only English. No other language 1s spoken in
our house.
Q: What day did you arrive in the United States?
A: I don’t’ remember. I have it all written down. 1948.
Q: In the spring
A: In the spring. And they she picked, she and my brother in law picked me up and we went
to Kittaning Pennsylvania which is about 40 miles out of Pittsburgh. That’s where they ended

up and I don’t know how and why but that’s it. I stayed with them for six months to learn the
American way of life. I remember that their friends were absolutely wonderful to me. They, I
spent time with them. They taught me the American way. They invited me to the country club.
They had brothers that took me out on a date. It was absolutely wonderful frightening
experience for me being in this country. I spoke English pretty well because we were liberated
by the Americans and I went to, we went to services with the American soldiers. And
Q: Religious services?
A: Yes the Jewish soldiers came to our synagogue and brought, and they had their rabbi that
brought everything. And then they came to our house for tea afterwards and this is how I learned
to speak. Well I spoke English but I learned to speak much better. But anyway one day my
sister said after having been there for six months, it’s about time for you to go and get a job. So I
took the bus into Pittsburgh and I applied, went to some stores. Department stores, ready to wear
stores and the first time I didn’t’ get anything. Well a couple weeks later you know there’s a
slow season in August. Things pick up in September. I went back in and I got a job. I got a job
at Max Asens that was a store that only sold furs, coats and suits. And here this gentleman gave
me a job. I was scared to death because really I hadn’t done much sewing for a long, long time.
But I had to have a place to stay.
Q: The three years that you were with your folks —
A: I just stayed home with them.

A: No
Q: Ok so now you have your first job.
A: And now I have my first job. And well I had to have a place to stay. Well my sister’s
friend had an aunt in Pittsburgh who lived, had an apartment over a restaurant and she was
willing to take me in. I didn’t’ have a room by myself. I had, I lived, I shared a bedroom with
her. And I shared the apartment with her and it was difficult. I didn’t’ have really the freedom
that I wanted but I couldn’t’ afford more. And she was happy to have me because she used this
money to send, help send her son to law school. It was hard. it was hard, but then again I had
help. My sister’s friends sent somebody, sent young ladies over to pick me up and take me to
Hadassah meetings. And this way I was introduced to Hadassah and a Jewish way of life. And
know that there was a ride. And I wanted to take in everything. I went to the Y. I went
swimming at the Y. I and through the Hadassah I made friends. I made girlfriends and it was
hard. I was by myself. And I had to live on $25 a week. I had to pay room and board and I had to
eat and I had to dress myself. But I did it. I was very poor. I remember sometimes if I didn’t’
have any money I ate M&Ms for dinner. And I remember I got paid on Monday morning and I
would go into town just enough money to pay the car fare and I probably had a penny left. But
that was fine. I mean I got used to that. I didn’t’ want anything from anybody. I supported
myself.

by himself. There was nobody that could take care of him except my aunt Lisian from London.

Holocaust. My Aunt Lisian came and stayed with my father. And took care of him. And but

wanted to make up for all the years that I lost. I took myself to the theater by myself. I went, I
sat in peanut heaven. All the way in the back just enough to see the shows that I had missed. I
wanted to make up for all the time and my girlfriends say to me you go out on a Saturday night
by yourself. If I don’t’ have a date on Saturday night I don’t’ even answer the phone. I said this
doesn’t make any difference to me. I want to go and make up and see everything and do
everything that I’ve never been able to do. I didn’t care if I had a date. I didn’t care if I, I just
wanted to see everything. But anyway here I was at the Y and everybody played bridge. My
