Interview with Nesse Godin
December 14, 1995
Answer: Someone will pick up the tape and really not realize what | was liberated
from. So | really think that this tape should start, me telling you that I’m a Holocaust
survivor. | lived through the Holocaust from the age of 13 to 17, the ghetto, Shoriley
(ph) Toovania (ph), concentration camp Shtoodruff (ph), several labor camps and
went on a death march. At the end of the death march in the middle of February of
1945, we were put in a barn. We were at that point out of the thousand women,
about six or seven hundred left. As soon as the Nazis, the SS and Gestapo that
were guarding us brought us to the barn, they pushed us in there, | remember it
was very, very crowded. There was nothing but straw on the ground. They ordered
about 50 women out, ordered them to dig two giant long holes. We really thought
that they were going to line us up and shoot us. At that point, we felt the death was
welcome to us. We were tired of all this business but they had different plans for us.
On one hole they put sticks on, they served, it served as a bathroom. The other
hole, we found out soon enough, that that would be a grave. The SS and the
Gestapo knew that we are going to die in that barn. No food was allocated to us
already from the government, from the German government. Whatever the people
from the village gave, some day a potato, some day a crust of bread, somedays we
didn’t get any. We started to die in that barn. Epidemic of typhoid, dysentery,
hunger. Every morning the guards ordered the little bit healthier women to take out
the dead and dress them naked cause the clothes you can recycle and dump the

body in the hole. My dear friend, what my eyes saw, in those three weeks that |
was in the barn, it’s very hard to tell, to share, to describe. Many times | feel | don’t
want to talk about it anymore but we are sitting, this tape is for history, to learn the
truth. Every day that | walked from the barn to the so-called bathroom, it wasn’t
anymore a hole, it was a mountain of skeletons covered with skin. Now through the
Holocaust | was a little girl but | pray to God, | prayed please God let me live through
a day. | prayed to God, please God let me live through a night. Maybe I'll be free.
But in that barn | started to pray to be dead, to be on top of this mountain. | was
tired of living. All through the Holocaust we used to say, “Let’s resist the Nazis, let's
live a extra day, they want us dead.” But in that point, | was really tired of resisting.
But God’s will was different. Marched in, we were liberated by the Russian Army.
Now you ask me about liberation. My dear friend, | have a problem with the word
liberation. Did any army come to liberate us? Did any country send soldiers, said,
don't worry about anything, just free those people? They fought the war, they found
us there. We were found. Yes we were freed but we were found. Now | want to tell
you of that day of liberation. That morning, when the women that were supposed to
take out the dead, took out the dead, undressed them, threw them on them pile of
dead bodies, they came back into the barn and they told us that they don’t see the
guards. They said, “The guards are not here.” Some women started to say, “Let’s

run to the village.” The village was, was within sight. We could see maybe one mile
away. We women start say, “How can we run? We cannot even walk.” Somebody
else said, “The guards may be hiding behind the barn. They just wait for us to start
running and they'll have an excuse to shoot us.” So all day long we sat in that barn,
not knowing that the guards had run away. They escaped. You see we did not
know whether the war was ending, where the positions of the armies were. We
didn’t even know that there were Allied forces. We didn’t know a thing. In the
evening, it was dark already, | remember it well, we heard footsteps of boots. Now
up to this day when | hear boots marching, even on the beautiful parade, | get
nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections
so there we heard these footsteps and we said, “Oh, the henchmen are back.” But
we heard Russian language. Russian language, Russian soldiers, dear ladies, we
didn’t know you were here, we were, we are fighting the war, we found already a
few other camps. We cannot stay with you. We leave two, three people.
Tomorrow there medics will come and help you. So all through the night we still
stayed in that barn, naturally we were free. Now what happened in that barn the
night of liberation? Some people applauded with their hands. They could hardly
move them. Some people jumped up for joy. Some people started to talk where
they will go, what will they do. | personally cried. | cried so hard and it is now 50

years after liberation. And for 50 years, I’m trying to analyze, why did | cry? Did |
cry for my family that was dead? At that point, | didn’t Know if anyone was alive
because in that barn | was alone. No one of my family. Did | cry for, because |
didn’t know what was happening? Did | cry for joy? But | came to a conclusion that |
cried because | felt sorry for myself. | thought where am | going? There’s no
telephone to pick up and tell I’m coming home. There’s no home, no family and
sincerely, many kind people say, “Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don't
see tears from you.” | really cried that time the last time. So once in a while, | have
a little tear in my eye. | learned to laugh and to love. But | never cry. So that was
this night, the day of liberation. The following day, when the Russians
came, they explained to us that the village does not have a hospital. They have a
little hotel. They are going to convert this little, it’s a inn, not even a hotel. They are
going to convert it into a hospital. They are going to try to take the little healthier
women and bring them to the village, put ‘em in the little homes. Some homes were
already empty. The Germans had run away being afraid for the Russians. Some,
in some homes there were still some Germans that stayed. | know they spoke
German, it was a German area. Pomerania, mostly, Polish German, border but
this little village was mostly German. They, so the Russians the next day came with
little carts, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and buggy. |

personally was carried by a Russian soldier, on his arms, and he carried me to the
village. | was nothing but skin and bones. And he brought me to the village, he put
me in the kitchen of that little room, on a straw sack and he said that eventually
somebody will come and help me and give me food. A little bit later, they brought
another woman that they put next to me on the straw sack. This woman, I’m really
sorry that | cannot remember her name. She was a teacher in one of the religious
Yovna (ph) schools and | knew her from before the war because | had friends that
went to that school. And when | saw her | was so glad that she was there next to
me on that straw sack. At least | felt | had someone from home. And the Russian
soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us. Also,
some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from
the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit. After
| was there one day or two days, | really don’t remember, one day, one of the
women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, “What are you doing
here with a dead person?” | didn't realize that the woman next to me was dead.
They carried her out and | wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they're
burying her or whatever. But! couldn't. So | thought let me look out and see how
the free world looks. Cause | hadn't seen the free world. Could hardly get up. And
there was a windowpane, it was already towards evening. And | looked through

that windowpane to see how is freedom? What’s outside? And what | saw was a
monster. A reflection of a monster in that windowpane. A person, eyes sunken in,
really a skeleton covered with skin. That's what | saw. Like you see children for
Halloween how they have these masks and | turned around to see who was behind
me and there was no one there. And this is when | realized how | looked. How |
looked. | did not really imagine that | looked that way. Okay. After a few days
being in that house, one, a truck or a car, a truck, | believe it was a truck that came
and picked us up and took us to that makeshift hospital. What | remember of that
coming to the hospital, | remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts
wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because | remember
a burn of a, where they shaved. And then | didn’t remember anything else. Not a
thing. Next thing | remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat
on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that | shouldn't
worry, I'm in a hospital and he would love to know my name. Because they did not
have time to register me when | became unconscious. According to what they told
me | was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two
different diseases. And him telling me that the most thing that he’s worried about is
that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn't have to be
amputated. And as | started to tell him my age, people from down the row, it was

like a big ward with many beds, somebody else tells “Oh, Nesa

that’s you! We didn’t know who this was. Everybody asked do you
know this person?” And there were a few people from my hometown that | knew
and | really felt already more comfortable about it. So | was gettin’ a little better.
People started to leave from the hospital and then | was transferred to another
smaller room. The main thing, the treatment was on my legs. And | don't even
remember if | ever said that, if | gave this testimony or not but | really feel | should
tell it now. | decided that | don’t want to live. After all this that | went through, the
stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when | think back of it, it was crazy. |
heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that hospital there
was a mother and a daughter and here | was all by myself. | thought what do you
need to live for? So | decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a
little food, | just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me. And she was, | thought
of that, I’m terrible but now | think of her as wonderful, she told on me. So they
wouldn't walk out from the room until | finished the food. And | really recovered
pretty good. My, what was at that point, | still had, you see at the very end on the
death march | was beaten up severely. And | still had my face swollen. My toes
had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like
you see a snake change his skin? That's how this came off. And my temperature

went down and | gained a little bit weight so, they kept me there because | was
alone for a while. And then one day they told me | have to go down to the office.
The office was like a little room. And when | came down there, they said to me, “We
are going to close this hospital and you can go now. We feel you're in good shape.
You can go.” And | said to them, “Where should | go?” They said, “Well, you want
to go up, where are you from?” | said, “I’m from Lithuania but | don’t have a home.
| don't have a family, | don’t have anybody. | don’t know where | should go. I’m 17
years old. | don’t know what to do.” So they asked the lady that was next to me
where she was from and she happened to be from Lithuania and because | was just
17, | was a minor. | was assigned to her. | became her ward. We had one
document that stated her name and my name, my last name and saying that she’s
in charge because I’m a minor. And that’s how we left Freenuv (ph).
Q: Do you have her name? Do you remember her name?
A: | don’t, | remember her first name, Hannah, but | don’t think | ever knew her last
name. | don’t think | ever knew it. She was very kind. She was very nice. She was
more like a sister to me than a stranger. So we left, with the idea to go to Lithuania.
She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family. She was from
Kaunas and she really thought that maybe her child is alive. She wants to go back.
Now | wanted to go to Lithuania because the last thing that we said to each other

when we came to the concentration camp, that is my brother and my mom before
we were separated, if we survive this hell, we have to make a meeting point, back
home in Lithuania. So okay. So this | had back in my mind. And | thought after all,
we had a home, we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for
safekeeping. Maybe I'll find it. So that was my plan. So there we go. You couldn't
go to the railroad station, say | want to buy a ticket to go to Lithuania. Didn't work
that way. See you are very young, | don’t know if you understand that. That first it,
it wasn't even, the war hadn't even ended yet, so a military trucks were going east
and they were going west and they were going south. Trains were going back and
forth. The Russians were looting Germany and taking machinery back to Russia.
So you hitchhiked. You hitchhiked on a train, on a freight train. You stood there,
you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you. They said, “You want to
go up to this and this little town, we'll take you.” Then you have to wait for a next
train and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere. And this is the way we
arrived in the city of Lodz, Poland. When we arrived in Lodz, Poland, like through
the grapevine while we were traveling people were telling us that in Lodz, Poland,
there is already shelters. Christian relief, Red Cross, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the
Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees. All of a sudden we
were called refugees. So, we were very glad to arrive in Lodz. When we came

there, there was a big shelter on 66. | remember that address and we,
when we came in there was a very big room, we signed in, we were assigned where
to go to sleep and in that room on the walls, there were big billboards. Posters like,
and it was divided by country and divided each country more or less by city. And
you, if let’s say if you were from Kaunas, Kaunas and surrounding and
surround Siauliai, that’s in Lithuania was called and surrounding. So | saw quite a
few names there and | wrote down my name. That was in case somebody of your
family comes. That's how you got connected. You see when | tell it to people, they
cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but
this was the way you found each other. Your name and where you are staying,
whether you are continuing, whether you are in Lodz, wherever. And that particular,
that shelter was, there was a big courtyard with many houses on, see in Europe,
some people don't understand that especially in the large cities, they used to have a
whole courtyard maybe six, seven buildings. And you had to go in through a gate
and it was closed for the night. And so we were assigned in that same courtyard, a
place. Now all that night | thought to myself, why didn’t | write down my name within
eyesight. | wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody's going to bend down
and look for my name. | was 17, | wasn't too bright. And | could hardly wait for the
next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing. | said, “I'll put it

on again, that’s alright, nobody's going to say why do you have it twice.” And, as |
was writing my name, Nesa Galperin, that was my name N,E,S,A
G,A,L,P,E,R,I,N. Galperin. And a woman said to me, “What Galperin, are you from
Siauliai?” She was standing right next to me. And why did she ask that way? Just if
you come of European background, you can understand, they usually said, “| am
Galperin, the, the doctor Galperin, the lawyer Galperin, the shoemaker.” My parents
had a dairy business, | said, “| am Galperin from the dairy business from the
, from the dairy business.” And the woman looked at me and she said,
“No, Nesa, that’s you, you look so terrible, | would never recognize you.” And, and
she said that. | thought to myself, isn’t she crazy? Everybody looks terrible. And
when | looked at her, | recognized the lady. She was a very nice lady. But before
the war, everybody called her the, the , the person that is not all there.
She had some mental problems. And next thing out of that woman’s mouth was,
“Oh, | was with your mother in the camp. She's in this and this shelter in this and
this village.” And | said, “You were with my mother. My mother was taken to Galepf
(ph) in Shtoodruff (ph).” She said, “Yes but then there was another selection and
they took the people in the sixties away to the left,” and asked, she was maybe in
her thirties and my mother was in the forty, she said, “They took us again and send
us to labor.” Now as young as | was, | thought can | believe a crazy woman?

Always people said the crazy so and so. So | didn’t know but | thought, | said, “Well,
maybe | should check it out.” So | go up to the lady, to this Hannah, who is my,
whose ward | am and | said to her, “We have to go back to the German border.”
She looked at me, she says, “Child you're crazy. Nobody goes back, everybody
goes forward.” | said, “But somebody told me that my mother is there, near the
German border.” She said, “I love you but how can | go with you to your mother? |
want to go to my own child.” | said, “But you have to go with me, you have the
document.” So she took the piece of paper, she tore it to pieces, she said to me,
“Go over to the desk, tell them you're 18 years old. And you'll have your own
document.” So | went over to the desk. | told them I’m 18 years old. | need a, a
document. They gave me the document. Now everybody’s traveling one way, I’m
traveling the other. Everybody’s going east, I’m going west. Some Russian soldier
felt sorry for me, gave me his coat. And it was May already. | remember being on
one of the trains and hearing a lot of shooting and thinking that we are being
bombed but that was the celebration of VE Day and | arrived at that village. Got to
the village, found the shelter, walk in there and | see women from my hometown
and | recognize them, some woman that had bakery, another one that had a dry
goods store, another one that had, that sold buttons and thread and all kinds of
things. And | look at with my eyes and they say, “Who are you?” And | say again,

“?’m Galperin from the dairy business.” “Oh, Nesa, your mom heard that you were
alive and she heard that you were in Lodz and she went there to look for you.” So
you can see, this isn’t just my story, how we survivors went looking for families back
and forth, back and forth, hearing rumors, trying to find each other. It took me about
maybe another two weeks or three weeks to get back to Lodz.
Q: Nesse, tell me what you remember of your feelings when it was then confirmed
that your mother was alive and you could trust these reports?
A: Oh, my, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. | just thought in my heart that
maybe | was kind to, to some older person. When you are 17 and you think of
somebody 46 or 47, it’s old. | just thought maybe God helped to my prayers.
Maybe God paid me back because | was kind to some older ladies in the camps.
And it, you, it just undescribable, undescribable, that | felt so grateful, so grateful.
And those remember asking me was their child with me. And unfortunately there
wasn't. | was with some people not even from my town, just a few from my
hometown were with me in my camp. And when | came to Lodz back, yeah, we
human beings are really wonderful, a wonderful thing on the earth. When we came,
when | came back to Lodz even out of the survivors there was a welcoming
committee at the time. | came down in the three weeks that | wasn’t there or four
weeks, such a difference. | didn’t have to ask where is the shelter. There were

women saying already, “Where you from? I’m going to help you, there’s a shelter.”
And a woman with red hair, | don’t remember her name, came over, she said,
“Nesa.” | said, “How do you know me?” She says, “Ooh, | know, you were here, you
went back, I'll take you to your mother.” And | just went with her. | figured even if
she takes me to any mother, I'll just go. And | don’t Know how | walked up three or
four floors because as | told you my feet were so raw, | could hardly walk. | shuffled
my feet and there | came up and the only thing | remember of that reunion is this
woman knocked on the door and said, “Frau Galperin, Mrs. Galperin, | brought you
your daughter.” And she left. She didn’t even wait. And the door opened up and
there wasn’t any electricity, it was a candle burning, and there was my mother. She
looked like my mother and she didn’t run to grab me and hug me. She looked at me
and | couldn’t understand, why this cold reception. And she said to me, “Okay, take
off your junk.” | had, my face was wrapped because this was still swollen and a
hole in there draining parts and no hair, | still had that little hair and that was

me, “Take off your, your junk, your wrappings, your like was saying,

coat. And you see when | was a little child | had a tracheotomy. | had measles and

my actually, right here in the middle of my neck, she grabbed me. She said, “My

child, | didn't recognize you.” You see she looked the same because she was 46,

you don't change that much. But me as a little girl growing up and looking different

and, and all this, being so skinny and so ill. Now for weeks and weeks | didn’t go

down those steps cause | couldn't walk them down and | always wondered how did

| ever go up those steps. Now we were very fortunate to find each other. There we

were, a mother and a daughter, not too many survivors at that point had already

someone of their family. Some did but not too many, especially a mother. Forty-six

was considered old, not too many at that age survived the Holocaust. Now we

stayed in Lodz not knowing what to do.

Q: Nesse can! go back and...

A: Yes.

Q: Because it’s so moving, | imagine that what had kept you going was your, your

wish to survive, to be with your mother and brother? And | imagine it kept your

mother going, the hope to be there for you. And I, | just wonder, did you hold each

other? Would you, would you sleep soundly holding onto each other at night?

A: When, you see all through the Holocaust, it’s true the hope helped. But to very

sincere with you, there was no formula for surviving. Many times people will say to

me, “Oh, Nesse, you're a strong lady, that’s why you survived the Holocaust.” | was

Now how intelligent was it? | was just a kid. It, | survived maybe by the grace of
God, maybe by sheer luck, maybe by the kindness of women that held my hand
and did give me hope or gave them their own bite of bread. Or maybe women that
took straw and wrapped my body so | would keep warm. | didn’t understand that
straw is a insulation. | really don’t know what made me survive. | really don’t know
what made my mother survive. My mother always, when she died 27 years ago
here in the United States, she alway, at that time people didn’t take oral history. |
wished they would have had her oral history. She was telling me how many times,
even from the labor camp, she was selected to go back to the concentration camp
to be killed. And by some miracle she was left or she was overlooked or they
decided that she can still work. At one point she said to me, “They told another
woman to take off the shoes and give it to her and the woman went there and she,
she, she was still alive.” So we don’t know how but when we were reunited, we
became really like one person. We, | didn't even want my mother to leave that
room. She used to have to go down to bring up some food or get in that shelter
some food or, or food stamps or whatever we, like little nut foods, there was a little
ticket to go to get the food. | was always afraid that if she leaves me that | won’t see
her again. And from the day of liberation, no from the day of reunion with my

again, she lived with us, with my husband and | until the day she died. And |

died, | thanked God for giving me a gift of so many years after the Holocaust to
have a mother. Many people thought | was crazy at her funeral. You see now |
have a tear when | think of my mom. But at her funeral, | stood there when the
casket was being lowered and | said, people didn’t want me to watch how they
lower the casket. They said you’re supposed to stay aside. | said, “No, | have to

adored my mother. He really was, he lost his whole family. He cannot even listen
to me speak about the Holocaust. And he was very kind and glad to have her and
we cherished her. Anyway, to continue what happened afterwards. So one day,

married name was Tabreeshock (ph). This gentleman told my mother that he
stationed in Lodz and his cousin who was my uncle by marriage and my aunt, my
father’s sister succeeded to escape from Vilna, just as the, before the Germans
marched in to the Soviet Union. That they have returned back to Vilna and they
hope as Polish citizens to, they had, there was a certain law, that you were allowed
to live , Vilner (ph), that’s we Jewish people call , If youre a
Polish citizen you were allowed to go back to Poland. And most people did not want
to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had
the dream at that time to, to go to Israel or to come to America. So he told us that
he knows that in a very short time, he doesn't Know it'll take a week or two weeks or
three weeks that his cousin and, and, he’s, my aunt who's, he’s cousin to by
marriage are going to try to come to Lodz. We shouldn't go nowhere, we'll be
reunited. So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming? My
mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive.
They arrive in Lodz, my uncle, my aunt. They had a boy that was twelve years old.
My uncle’s best friend, he’s my, his best friend’s brother and the brother's best
friend, so there are three single men with my uncle and my aunt and that little boy.
So we are already a family unit. Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my
uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we

go? Where should we go. We get already messages that the men were liberated
from Dachau. We hear already that the men that were taken to Shtoodruff (ph) that
came with us from Siauliai were taken to Dachau and the camps of
Dachau. So we are waiting to hear maybe someone of the men survived.
Eventually come a few gentlemen that were liberated from Dachau that are from my
hometown. What they did, they decided to send out a few people to come to
Poland, see if, and tell the women don't go back to the Soviet Union, don't go to
Communism. Try to come to the American Zone. So and so they came with list
telling who survived. On that list was my brother's name. And we knew this, one of
this gentleman and he said you, to my mother, “Your son said if | find you, try every
which way to come to the American Zone.” Why was the aim to go to the American
Zone? My mother had a sister that lived in Washington, D.C. And if we would be in
the American Zone, we would be able to come to America. So here we are, all this
group of people, not knowing what to do. So one day, my mother says to me, “You
know, Nesa, we two women alone, we couldn't do all this traveling.” We couldn't,
you still had to go a little bit across the border, there was no really regulations about
the border. But still you have to take a chance, you had to take a truck, you had to
walk. She says, “We two women alone couldn't really manage all of this. One of us
have to get married.” And | looked at my mother and | thought she has me. Why

does she want to get married? But the next thing out of my mother’s mouth was,
“My child, | had a wonderful husband. He was killed in Auschwitz. But you, it’s true
youre very young. Maybe you should get married.” So | looked at her, | said,
“Where do | get a husband?” And she said, “Look at those guys, three guys, single
guys. The friend of the uncle’s, his brother and his friend.” Well | looked at the
three guys and | said, “Well this one is too old. This one is too short and maybe this
one.” So my mother said, “Okay.” Now | don’t know how Jack and | got married, |
really don't know. We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and | never
kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I’m his wife.
And so, we were already like a, a threesome, a family. But | really didn't, legally, |
was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on
we had the religious wedding. So here we are, trying to find out how can we get to
the American Zone. So everybody says not a big deal. There is a, the Jewish
agent, he’s helping out people to go across the border. Once you get into Berlin,
Berlin had four zones: The Russian Zone, the French Zone, the English Zone, the
American Zone. So to go to the Russian Zone was no problem because we were in
the same place. And we didn’t have any luggage, we didn't have anything. So we
took a walk and we were in the American Zone. And when we registered there in
the camp and eventually through the Jewish Agency, people came and helped you

to go to wherever you had family. And my brother was already at that point in a
displaced person camp called Feldafing. And in October of 1945, we arrived in the
displaced person camp. At that point, we had separated from the rest of the people
because we were privileged to go to Feldafing because my brother was there.
Q: Would you tell me the name of this brother and which one...
A: Yeah.
Q: It was [talkover].
A: That's my oldest brother, Yurhaskel (ph) and he was liberated in one of the

camps of Dachau and from those camps they were all put in the
Feldafing Displaced Person Camp. When we arrived, they were already, | think
they were liberated in May, maybe | don't know exactly whether May or June that
displaced camp was formed, but when we arrived in October, it was pretty much
organized. Now my aunt and my uncle, they were assigned to another displaced
person camp ‘cause Feldafing was pretty crowded at that point. But if you had
family you were allowed to go and be reunited so this is why we came to Feldafing.
And we, we registered in the, as soon aS we came. You have to register every,
within the little town, police. It's funny because | still have the, found the little
document where | registered that | came there. And that’s how we wound up in the
displaced person camp.

Q: And tell me about the reunion with your brother.

A: The reunion with my brother was different than with my mother. Because,

because of us knowing that he was alive and because of him knowing that we were

alive. And because of him trying to make arrangements for us to get us permission

to come. Although we didn't see each other, but by knowing that we were alive, it

wasn't like when | walked in and there was my mother. Naturally it was very

emotional but not like you got surprised, you see somebody, you didn't know they

were alive.

Q: Do you remember what you felt and how he looked? [talkover]

A: He, at that point, he looked a little, pretty good. He didn't look so bad because

don't forget from May ‘til October, we all, | looked already better, my hair had grown

and, and we looked already entirely different. And he was married in the ghetto and

his wife, who was with me in, in the labor camp, and we were separated after

liberation, she was there already. She had come already there. So we found him

already with his wife and it was just so wonderful. In that villa, it was called Villa

Valbearta (ph), those villas were used actually for SS men, for their entertainment, it

was like a country club. Feldafing had golf courses and, and all this beautiful things

for the SS and the Gestapo to come and enjoy themselves and that thing was

turned into the displaced person camp. For the plain (ph) soldiers, they had these

barracks and that's where originally the survivors were put in, in those barracks. But
if the family started to come, they assigned those buildings, those villas they called it
villas. So now that villa that we were in, maybe one family lived before or one SS
man with his wife or a commandant or whatever. And here we were, downstairs in
one room lived a woman with her, with her husband that she married right after the
war two, another room, two, I’m trying to think, we were like five families, five
different groups, units that lived in that one house. They called it a villa. It was a
house like my house. And we were assigned the kitchen. Now don't forget, | wasn't
really sleeping with Jack. He, to me he wasn't, he was a husband on paper but we
hadn't had a a religious wedding. There | slept with my mother in one
bed and then there this other bed that poor Jack had to sleep. And then they
started to plan our religious wedding. And after a few months, we were married.
And...
Q: And it was at Feldafing.
A: In Feldafing and there wasn't a big to-do there, we went to the rabbi and it was
my brother, and my sister-in-law and my mom and Jack and | and my
sister-in-law kept on saying to me, “You have to be very serious when you get
married. Especially in our tradition, you have to go around the, the groom seven
times.” And she said to me, “Would be nice if you put on a pair of shoes with heels

so you look a little taller.” | don’t Know who gave us those, those heels but | hadn't
worn heels before. And when | was walking around Jack, | couldn't stop laughing. |
was laughing and laughing, laughing, and everybody said, “That stupid kid. She’s
gettin’ married, look at her, such a stupid girl.” So that was in Feldafing. And we
lived actually in that kitchen, we just switched beds. Jack hopped into my bed, my
mother got his bed. We stayed there for a year, in that kitchen, until my oldest
daughter was born. She was born in March of 1947 and when we, when she was
born in ’'47, some of the people had already documents to immigrate somewhere.
Some people went on illegal immigration to Israel. And so we, the, the camp had
already little bit more space so we were assigned in another villa, was called Villa
Gowlitz (ph) a room. But still we shared that room with my mom and Jack and | and
my youngest daughter, my oldest daughter. And the life in the displaced person
camp, it was organized living. Some people think well you were free and you were
free. | remember there was a curfew when we first came to the camp. In later
years, not. But when we first came to the displaced person camp, is was a curfew.
You were not allowed to go in town whenever you wanted. Yes it was no gate, it
was not fenced but you were told that after, | don’t remember, ten o’clock or eleven
or whatever, don’t remember anymore, you were not allowed to walk around. Also,
it was very difficult. Can you imagine us victims, | don't call us survivor, we were

victims that survived by miracle, walking among murderers? You see now if | would

come to Germany, it's a new generation, new people. Young people that will not

dare, it’s a new life, a new government. But don't forget, right in 1945 and ’46, the

Nazis were there. You could see it on their faces, men that just put on, changed

their coat, that’s all. Their feelings they still had.

Q: Nesse were there individuals there, that you Knew had been sort of perpetrators

talkover?

A: Well not that | knew personally [talkover] yes, others would know. And, and then

they started to talk about having trials for, they started to talk about later on what

came about, the Nuremburg Trials, but in the, for the time being all those people

were walking around free. Maybe the main, main 20 leaders, | don’t know exactly

how many were taken to the jail right away. Let's say a few hundred. But

thousands and thousands that killed human beings were walking around free. They

just said they obeyed orders.

Q: Right. | understand that was one of the hardest things in the camps for the

[talkover] survivors [talkover]

A: Yes, it was difficult because you walked, you went in to register in the police

office and there you thought that the German man that you thought maybe he was a

guard in a camp somewhere. It was very difficult. It was, maybe it was a innocent

man that maybe stayed at and minded his own business, was, closed

his eyes to what was happening around there. Now is that innocent?

Q: Yeah. Even then you'd, that would be hard.

A: Exactly. But when you walk around each, there were cases of still there were

anti-Semitic incidents and even if, if someone said something to you without

meaning anything, you as a victim thought well, he wants to kill you again. It was

very difficult to live so many years in, in, in that area.

Q: How long was it before the organization and the running of Feldafing was placed

in the hands of the Jewish community?

A: Well | tell you, when | came in October, it was pretty much in the Jewish

community. It was guided by the Unruh (ph).

Q: Yeah, you, would you explain what Unruh (ph)?

A: Yeah. United Nation Relief Organization. And so it was guided. They had a

person that was in charge. But more or less they let the Jewish community, there

was a person that was like president of the camp, people that were in charge of, of

the food, distribution of food, there were, at the very beginning, there were two

kitchens. Public kitchens. One was kosher and one was not. Now when we came,

because my brother knew somebody, my husband got the job in the kosher kitchen.

everything rationed. You got your ration card, you went and that’s when they gave
you food. So at the beginning, you really had to go to that kitchen to get your food.
After while, they kind of gave you the food and you could cook it in your little room or
in your little kitchen, wherever. But at the beginning, you just had to go to those
kitchens. Also, packages started to come from the United States, from the Red
Cross or whatever, there was a, a warehouse for clothing. Like we give now for the
poor and they come. | was watching the other day how the children came and
when got their toys and how happy they were. And it reminded me how | went to
the warehouse and | picked a pair of shoes and | picked a dress and there | had
already two dresses. So all this somebody, people don't realize, they think you
were free from the camps and you picked up your life. It didn’t work that way. It
didn’t work that way. Few of the people had the wisdom to try to go back to school.
| really maybe, maybe | got married a little too quick, maybe if | would have gone to
school before | got married, maybe my mother’s idea wasn't the best one.
Q: Tell me more about the, how quickly most people married and how unusual is it
for your marriage has lasted and been very happy but did that, were most of the
marriages [talkover]

everybody got married. |, | don’t to say everybody, most of the people. Everybody

would be everybody, everybody. When women were alone, if the, if the guy could
buy them a pair of shoes, they were willing to get married. You were alone, you
were not, the men started the little bit, Trades (ph) started a little bit black market
business. There was something that you could do but what could women do? So
most people were getting married, also, also, it was very much encouraged by the
community. Let's rebuild our nation. Let's have children. For every child that died,
let's have another child. And within a year, that’s all you saw, is baby carriages.
When | was pregnant, every woman was pregnant. Every woman in the displaced
person camp was pregnant. You talk to survivors and they'll tell you. I’m 47, my
child was born. And everyone that you will take interview they will have a child born
47, or 48 or 49. This was not just in spite of the Nazis wanted us dead. Let's
rebuild our people. So people got married, not necessarily before, because they fell
in love. | don’t say, not everyone, some fell in love, young people, but most
because they needed each other. Mostly because they needed each other. | tell
you the truth and | sit with Jack and we talk many times. He says to me, “I gave you
a kiss, why do you say | never gave you a kiss before we got married?” But maybe
gave me a peck on the cheek. I’m talking what we see now, a kiss. We were not in
love when we got married. We needed each other. But among survivors, you don't
see divorces. You don't hear about divorces. Very seldom you will talk to a survivor

that divorced. We needed, we raised our children and | tell you, Jack and I, | don't
think there was a prettier love between two people that got married without love.

Q: Going back to that time in the barn when the Russians came in and liberated
you, why you think you gave up then?
A: Well actually |, | gave up when | was already in the hospital getting better. When
|, | didn’t give up all through that. |, | lived day by day saying I'll resist the Germans,
| will live. And then once | started to get a little better, and, and healing myself, |
was gettin’ ready to give up. That's the most stupid thing that | could have done.

helped the Nazis. After the fact, they would have had one more human being dead.

that was really no reasoning. When | think back about it, | think it's the most stupid
thing that | thought to do. But when you're young, sometime you, you not happy
with a girlfriend or you’re not happy with a boyfriend, you going to commit suicide.

out so they would understand how precious life is, how you can help each other,
how you don't join a gang or, or a group that you will be sorry about. And many
times they ask me about this suicide. And | tell them, | never tell them that | one
time thought of doing that, | always tell them if you do suicide, who do you help?
Yourself? You help your enemy.
Q: We're resuming with the interview with Nesse Godin on December the 14”,
1995. Nesse Godin, yeah, my name is Margaret West.
A: And, so, we were talking about the displaced person camp, how it was. Now
you ask me about my brothers. Now as | told you before, I'll just briefly go through.
On my other testimony and videotape, | speak a little bit maybe about it. But my
father was taken with the children selection on November 5" of 1943, to Auschwitz.
Somebody corrected me now and they said that nobody was killed in Auschwitz,
they were killed in Beerkano (ph). But this is after the fact, people decipher it and
they tell you. But when we were told, we were just told they were taken to
Auschwitz. So before all the information that was available that we have now, it was
just said to Auschwitz. So he was taken to Auschwitz or whatever, Beerkano (ph)
where the gas chambers and the crematorias were and he was killed. My mom as |
told you survived the same type of camp as | did. My older brother, Yerhuskel (ph)
survived Dachau concentration camp. Now my brother who is older than me five

years but | always refer to him as my younger brother because there was the older.
His name is Manasha (ph) Galperin. His experience was entirely different. When
we were being deported to the concentration camp, when we were being taken to
the railroad stations, all of a sudden we were there, my mom and my brother and
myself and two uncles and a aunt and my brother Manasha (ph). And all of a
sudden we didn’t see him. And my poor mom cried, she said, “Oh, that delinquent,
he must have done something and the SS men must have killed him,” or whatever.
You see when he was a young boy, he always got into trouble. | don’t mean trouble
like we say now, stealing or dope or whatever. He always, if he rode his bike, he
held onto a truck and that’s how he rode his bike. He was always daring and doing
things and he had all kinds of friends and, that my mother didn’t approve in the
younger days. So he had a Lithuanian friend that always told him, if things get very
bad, he’s going to help you. Young guy. And this guy always said to him,
“Manasha (ph), don’t come to our house cause my parents may not approve of
that.” But my brother knew his house, he knew the, the little forest next to it, a little
woods there, he say, “You know that smokehouse that we have there? You sneak
in there and when | will hear that the ghetto is being deported, I’m going to look and
to see if you are in that smokehouse. I’m going to put out food for you. But if they
catch you there, don't you ever tell that | let you in.” And this is what happen. That

day before we were really being taken, this young man found out that we were
being deported. And my brother says that somehow, he did send word to him, that
he’s ready for him to come. So he just somehow snuck away. We were walking, he
snuck away, they didn’t see him and he was in that forest. About three weeks later,
the Soviets took over this area, the outskirts of Siauliai and my brother was free. So
this is how he was liberated in Lithuania. Now his story was entirely different
because after a few years, 1946 or ’47 maybe ’47, | don’t know exactly when, he
was called by the NKBG. And they told him that they know that the mother and the
brother and the sister were liberated from the camps. And how come we did not
come back to Lithuania. We must be Zionists. And if we are Zionist, we are against
Communism. So he was sent to Siberia for 15 year. Now after being there all this
time, when Stalin died, some people, you know how when somebody that the
government gives you amnesty? So after being nine years in Siberia in the gulags,
he was given an amnesty and was let go. And because of our own involvement in
the United States and the involvement of the Israeli government on behalf of Soviet
Jewry, he was let go and he came to Israel. He lived there for 20 years. Then two
of his children married Americans and now, as we talk, he lives in Baltimore. | have
tried many a times for him to give testimony but he says he just cannot do it. He
says his blood pressure goes up too high. So you see, we are two people of one

all to teach the living what hatred and indifference can do. God bless him, he’s
lovely, he’s great, | love him, but he wouldn't talk to anybody. Not even to me. |
wanted to go with a tape recorder, take his story, he doesn't want to bring it up.
Q: What, what, what do you know about his time in Siberia?
A: Well, |, what | know about his time in Siberia, he tells wonderful stories
sometime, when he’s in the mood of talking. But he always says that if you share a
piece of bread, sometimes it saves your life. And when | say yeah, people shared
bread with me and maybe this saved my life, he said, no and he went in and told me
a story what happened to him. When he was taken from Lithuania, from Siauliai, to
go on the train to be taken to Siberia, his wife gave him a loaf of bread. While he
was sitting on the train, there was a man, a Russian man sitting next to him. The
Russian man said to him, my brother is a big man, he was always very big and he
was bald at a very young age. He said that this Russian man said to him, “Dyadya
(ph), uncle, would you share some bread with me?” So my brother as he was
taught by my mom, he took the loaf of bread, he broke it in half, handed it to this
stranger. This stranger couldn't get over that my brother would give him a half a
loaf of bread. After while, they were talking and he said to him, “You are a
remarkable man,” this stranger tells to my brother. “You don’t know me, you gave

me, | asked you for a piece of bread, you gave me half of your bread. You don't
even know where you're going.” So my brother says, “Well, wherever we're going,
we going. Whatever will happen will happen to both of us.” He says, “I’m going tell
you something. When you get up tomorrow morning and you don't see me here,
don’t be surprised. But when you arrive in the gulags, if somebody asks you for
your name, you tell them that you are Uncle Misha.” My brother's name was
Manasha (ph), in the Russian, Misha. Dyadya (ph) Misha. So my brother just didn’t
pay attention, said this crazy man what is he telling me. That’s all. So at night, he
was sleeping, he wakes up, the man is not there. My brother thought, did he have a
dream? He looks at his bread, half a bread is gone. So he must have given it to
somebody, and, okay. He said, well, maybe the man, maybe the NKBG put up a
man, you know how you start to think. Well, he arrives in those gulags and in
Siberia wherever he was there, | don’t know, and then he stands there and you
register, register you and they ask him, “What’s your name?” He says, “Manasha
(oh) Galperin.” The man said to him, “Do you have another name?” My brother
said, “No, | don’t have another name.” He says, “In Russian they call me Misha.”
He says, “Dyadya (ph) Misha?” He’s, he figures what can he lose, he will say. He
say, “Yes.” He say, “Well you are assigned to go to work in the infirmary.” You see,
in Russia, this underworld, even in the jails, even in the gulags, they had at that time

there, how do you say, underground. This man was one of this Russian Mafia or
underworld or something. So because of this half a bread, my brother say, always
says, he says he wouldn't have survived the conditions there if he would have had
to go to in the mines or, or do other work. But because he had this, this, so he says,
it pays to share your bread. And | tell young people now too, | said you always think
you don’t have much but if you have a quarter, give a dime to somebody. You
never know when it'll come back. So it was interesting. | wish sometime that he
would really give testimony but he, he says he cannot do it.
Q: Nesse, | wonder if you’d go back and talk first of all briefly about the
circumstances of your father being taken. But then when did your mother give up
hope of his being alive? | think it was, don’t think she knew for sure what had
happened to him.
A: Well | tell you. The children selection, as | speak in detail on my videotape which
I'm sure you heard that, my father was taken on that selection and when they were
taken away, the people on the railroads, the people that worked on the railroads,
our Jewish community council, the, the, whatever, the Unruh (ph) or whatever you
call them, they tried very hard to find out from different sources where were they
taken to. And at that time, we knew that they were taken towards Poland. We did
not know, every individual did not know exactly about gas chambers and, and

crematorias but now after all these years, | understand that maybe our leadership
knew already, that there were such things, such camps. But they were afraid to tell
to the everyday person what was happening in those camps. So there were rumors
that they were taken to another camp in Poland, with no name. We didn't know
Auschwitz, or no Auschwitz or whatever. What | remember at that time after the
children selection after my father was taken, the mood in the ghetto was terrible.
People started to believe in astrology, in astronomy. People sat in their houses and
made seances, holding their hands and sitting at the table and saying to the table, if
the children is, are alive, move three times, or move one time. And people really
believed that those tables were moving. All kinds of stupid, started to believing
cards, in laying out cards. | think this was all to have a flicker of hope, to not to give
up. My dear friend, when you take a thousand children, among them infants that
couldn't live one day without being taken care of, pushing them in, later on when |
was taken in those trains, and | was already at that time 16 years old, | was thinking
about how did those children live even to arrive? Somewhere. But after we were
liberated, after | came back to Feldafing, people, and had already documentation
that this transport was taken to Auschwitz. It was wishful thinking when, when | was
reunited with my mom, we still hoped, we still thought that maybe they're alive.
Maybe they'll be reunited. But when we arrived in Feldafing and | remember that

first high (ph) holidays that we were in Feldafing and it was decided to say prayer for
the dead, for those children. At that time it was already, hope was given up. |
myself, for many years, | used to have a dream. | used to dream that I’m coming to
some remote place and there is my father. And | used to say, “Papa, where have
you been? We've been looking for you.” But | don’t have the dream anymore.
Years ago | stopped dreaming that and | really thought that was my wishful dream.
| was hoping that one day | will find him. Now | gave up a long time ago to find him
alive because we knew that they were all killed. But even, | don’t know how many
years ago when the Red Cross came up, that they found a documentation, they
have in Baltimore some research and all that, and | wrote a letter to them saying
that my father was taken on the fifth of November of 1943 with the selection. It has
been proved that they were taken to Auschwitz. They were not even given
numbers. What | am looking for is how many days did this transport travel. Why
was | looking for it? Because | light a candle on the day that my father was taken.
He was still alive. | thought maybe if | would know four days later, three days later,

father. And after calling them back and telling them and explaining that | know you
cannot find him, he’s dead, just | need that information. They never found that
information. Now | think that the museum got some new information, some archives

in the former Soviet Union because Auschwitz was liberated. So one day I’m going

to upstairs and look and see if there is new information on that. So | light a candle

on the day that my father was taken and | let it burn for a whole week, thinking, is

that the right day, that, when he died, within my tradition, Jewish tradition, to light a

candle.

Q: And your brother, you mentioned that your brother lost his hair early. [talkover]

He looks like your father?

A: He was, he was, he was really very, very young when he lost his hair. And my

father used to shave his head and so does my brother.

Q: | saw the photo of your father at 47.

A: Now we are talking about Feldafing. You see when you talk to a survivor, we

wander away to another space, to another place, to another happening, but that’s

okay because it’s, since we are sitting in my house we have this privilege of going

back and remembering of things that are important for history. Going back to

Feldafing, now, the way as | told you Feldafing was organized, it was overseen by

the Unruh (ph) and ran a little bit by the own Jewish community. At the beginning

you had, as | said, you had to go to the main kitchens to get your food, later on you

received your, your rations whatever was assigned to you and I'm sure it was

enough calories for you to, to live on. | remember we got rations of peanut butter

and peanut butter and peanut butter since, since the displaced person camp, | really
never liked peanut butter. And dried condensed milk. And it was wonderful but it
was still rationed. Eventually, people started to get little jobs like my husband got
the job in the kitchen. My brother was working for the, well the clothing distribution
and food distribution. At one time he was like a judge in the camp because if there
were disputes among ourselves, among, in the Jewish community, it was taken care
of by our own people. We had our own police that made sure that everything is
taken care of properly. People started to work outside of the camp. After a few
years, the people started, some people started little businesses, some shoemaker
started to make shoes, some tailor started to make clothing. Some people started
to barter, it became a barter system. Now we ourselves, as soon as my aunt found
out that we were alive, we remembered her address, she lived on Sherman and
Euclid (ph) Streets in Washington, D.C. They had a tiny little grocery story, it was
called Sal’s (ph) Market. In those days, you didn’t have zip codes, you didn’t have
to write the zip code. We wrote a letter, Sal’s (ph) Market, Sherman and Euclid (ph)
Streets, Washington, D.C. My aunt got, she went to some relatives that had more
money. You had to give a security so otherwise you couldn't bring a family. You
have to show that the family is, can take care of the people that they are going to
bring. So she had, we had some distant cousins, some of them were car dealer,

some of them at liquor store and they all signed that we would be taken care of for
the family. But although those documents were done here, we could not leave
Germany. Because we were from Lithuania. The United States had a quota
system. I’m saying it very carefully because at one time people said, Nesse didn't
have a quarter, that’s why she didn’t come to United States. Quota system was x
amount of people were allowed to come from each country to the United States.
That was in effect for many years. Now there was no more Lithuania, Lithuania was
absorbed by the Russians, by the Soviet Union, but still, we the displaced persons
had to come on this quota. So, assuming, if they let in a hundred people of
Lithuanian descent to the United States, we had to wait our turn. So while we were
in the displaced person camp, Jack and | had two children there, in the camp.
Q: In what years?
A: My oldest daughter Panina (ph) was born in 1947, Ed was born 1949. Now as |
started to tell you, people started to have little businesses, raise a little money. Now
my aunt started to send us packages, packages of clothing and packages of
cigarettes, coffee. The German people were very anxious to have chocolate and
cigarettes and coffee. So there was a barter system. Let’s say if | wanted to have a
sewing machine so | could sew something, | gave the man so many cigarettes and
he gave me the old sewing machine. Or if | wanted some bed linens, if | gave him

this coffee, he gave, that was a barter system. People don’t understand that, how at
the beginning you didn't even need money. We didn't have money. You started to
barter things and once later, people started to have jobs and little businesses in the
displaced person camp. After a while, schools were set up for younger children.
Now we didn't have at the beginning, children per se because there were no
children from the camps but as people started to come like my aunt came from the
occupied Russia, she had a twelve year old, he needed schooling. So there were
children, so they had to have the schooling. Also, vocational schools were set up. |
myself went to a vocational school to learn how to sew. Because people said when
you come to America, its very good to know how to sew. People went to learn
languages. | went to learn English. At one time | went and | took a course in
bookkeeping. People said if you go to America, it's very good to be a bookkeeper
but they didn’t tell me that you need, need, need a certified accounting degree. So
peoples resumed a little bit a life and started to earn a little money. By the time, |
would say maybe 1947, ’48, people had already little money. People started to
work, some people started to work in Jewish agencies for the American
government. | don’t know really of anybody that really worked for any German per
se company.

camps?

A: | really don't Know. | understand that | talk to many people that they were run
pretty much the same because the Unruh (ph) was in charge of it. The only thing
was in some places you, you were in more barracks. Here at the
beginning we just had the barracks, then they gave us those villas so all of a sudden
we had like a bigger camp. Within the camp, some Zionist organizations were
organized. | remember Ben Gur Yon (ph) coming to Israel, to, from Israel to
Feldafing and | remember the whole camp was decorated with paper. With tissue
paper. Now | did not know, | just found out by watching the tape of the liberators, a
testimony of a person that was in charge of the camp telling how the Jews in the
displaced person camp decorated with toilet paper, the whole camp. Now at that
time, | didn’t know what, they just took this toilet paper, twisted it and it became like
decorations. We, we started within our own camp to have a little theater group,
lectures, that we, the younger people were encouraged to go. Now as | said, | got, |
got married very young. And | had to, | had my children, | had to take care of them.
And because | had my mom, | could attend some of those lectures and go to some
of those classes. But some of my own friends had the opportunity and they went

person camp, until we got our permission to come to the United States, | worked as
a secretary in between the camp at one time but most of all | did some alterations
for people because | learned how to sew. So | redid a hem or, or as | told you | was
so lucky that | had that sewing machine that | bartered for cigarettes. So | was a big
maha (ph). And that’s really, we did not have much at all. We came to the United
States without a penny in our pocket.
Q: Tell me how that waiting would go. Would you be, would you be getting
notification [talkover] every six months to say [talkover] maybe, maybe?
A: The notification was like this. You, they, you got the letter that all your papers
are here . . .[end of side 1 or tape 2] Okay. Now you know that we were all sick
people. Now | had right after liberation, in Munich, | had this surgery on my face
and | tell you the truth. For a little while, | had forgotten why | had that, that thing or
maybe | wanted to forget it. And they kept on saying that | have tuberculosis of the
glands. Wasn't tuberculosis of the glands, it was | was beaten up. But! just didn't
want to think about it or talk about, | don’t know. So now if | had tuberculosis of the
glands, they had to check me for a year so | wouldn't bring tuberculosis to the
United States. So we were postponed for another year. They found always an
excuse why you shouldn't come. | remember my mom went for her examination
and she was so nervous she couldn't urinate at that time. So they, they wrote down

pregnant with my son. They wouldn't let me go because | was pregnant. They said
| have to wait until he was born, until he was a year old. And constantly postponing
and postponing and people were frustrated. People wanted to go anywhere. They
didn't care where, who, what, who would let ‘em in. Yes, we personally really
wanted to come to the United States. Cause my mom, four of her brothers and
sister, two brothers and two sisters were killed in the Holocaust with their families
and she had that one sister. She really wanted to come to be with her sister. This
is, and with me, | was so young. My mother was the boss. Like she told me to get
married, she told me | have to go to America. My brother, he felt that after suffering
for so many years, we should have our own country. He is a Zionist, he lives in
Israel and he, although it meant separation again from the rest of the family, he
chose to go to Israel. And | remember his saying, he said, “We are free people. If
God will help us, we'll be able to see each other. We'll be able to visit each other.”
And the truth is that Jack and I, that’s the only vacations we take. Every few years,
we go to visit them in Israel. It's easier for us financially to do that than for them
from Israel. They were here a few times but mostly we go.

Q: Tell me about the hopes of most of the people in Feldafing. Would you have
been unusual in hoping to come, planning to come to America? Would most people
hope to go to Israel?
A: Well, | tell you. There was differences of opinion. | cannot say to you that
everybody was patriotic, wanted to go to Israel. | myself as, as a young woman of
18, 19, 20, | was afraid of war. | didn’t want to go to a place where there was war. |

there. And that was traumatic. So even this still had to go through the German
authority. | don’t know, maybe they meant well. They meant well whoever was in
charge. Maybe they thought it’s, that’s a good way to do it. But until really it was
given over more to the Jewish people to run their own, their own little camp how you
say, it was difficult. It was difficult. | Know, | used to even in 1947, when | went with
the baby carriage into the little town out of, the camp was a little bit away from the
little town. | don’t know if you have a picture of Feldafing, well that’s small, small
little town, not a big town. And | think | had a feeling at that time at the beginning
that like the German people looked and said, what is she doing here with a baby
carriage? She belongs somewhere else. And many times we heard that. We heard
the people say, although we understood German very well, what are they doing
here? They belong in the camp. But later on, later on things really changed. There
were young people that grew up that were children or teenagers and were more
compassionate. There were people that we met, my mom by saying we, my mom
and |, especially there was one lady, we called her oma (ph), grandma, that suffered
from the Nazis. She was a German lady. Her husband was a postmaster before
the war, before the Nazis took over. And he was put in jail and she was left with two
children, two teenagers. And one day she just came, somehow, she saw my
mother and she walked over and she said, “Lady, I’m a German lady that suffered

from the Nazis and if you would just let me come and clean your house and help
you, | would be grateful if you would just give me a little wood or a little food,” and
we befriended that lady and we just loved her and so. There were different
relationship, different people but in later years, Feldafing was not a uncomfortable
place to be in, not a uncomfortable place to be in. It was like | said, a Jewish police,
a Jewish little like a government and if you needed a extra coat or something there
was like a, people that received packages, were not given as much as the ones that
were, the social system was a little more righteous at that point. But |, 1am, as, asa
person that lived there for five years and talking to other survivors that were in
Lunzberg (ph) or in Fairenweld (ph) or in Hightenhime (ph) or in different, it was
pretty much the same. It was pretty much the same. People at the beginning,
naturally having to be on ration and so forth and later on, people, people that were a
little bit older that knew how to open a little business, they actually let the people
started to sell equipment for a tailor, let's say a thread and zippers and buttons.
They went somewhere and bought a little bit, came back to the camp and, and sold
it to the tailors and raised a little money, so small little businesses | would say the
type like the years ago, the pushcart peddler.

sort of momentos?
A: We had nothing. We had nothing. Because we were taken from home. We
were taken to Shtoodruff (ph), we were stripped naked, we were not successful to
bring anything, anything of our own through. Some people that went back to
Poland, let’s say if | would have been from Lodz, originally, maybe when | came
back if | would have gone to my old house, maybe | would have found something.
Also don’t forget, many people came back to Poland and went to the little villages
and were killed because of that possession. The people that moved into those
Jewish homes were afraid not to give away the stuff, they were afraid that they
would be prosecuted because they lived there. They killed them. So some people
succeeded to bring something back. We had nothing, nothing from home. But | am
still very lucky, cause you saw pictures of my family from home. Now how do | have
them? Before the war, my mom sent constantly pictures to her sister in the United
States. My mom had two aunts, my grandfather, her father’s two sisters and their
families lived the United States. And constantly how you send, they were in touch.
They sent pictures. So every picture that you saw on a
tape or later if we have a chance I'll show them to you there on display, my family
room. Those are pictures that were sent before second world war to the United
States. So from home, nothing. What you see my house is everything that’s

the community, you mentioned the theater, but reviving songs. . .

Q: Music, stories . . .

Q: And that would probably well, [talkover] raising children then.

A: Yeah this is very important because we, we also, | don’t know if it was in

Feldafing, | think it was out of Munich, a new Jewish newspaper was printed. And

there is cultural little events, our own Jewish community started to feel that we have

to bring from, we started to bring from one displaced person camp to another, our,

our stars, our, our little singers and dancers and, and, and people that survived that

were actors in Poland. They started to bring old movies that were made years ago,

Yiddish movies for us to see and to learn about. Eventually they started to bring

operas for people that should get, like me, | never knew what an opera was. To

learn that there is such thing as operas. People that were poets started to write

songs and poems about the lives in the ghetto. Also people that remembered the

songs that were born in the ghettos, in the camps, they were documented. Some of

the people were not even alive anymore that wrote those songs but some were. So
all these be, started to be documented. They started to do books on, memorial
books from their communities. They got like we are sitting now, at that time we
didn't have tape recorders, everything had to be done on the typewriter or longhand
or whoever knew shorthand to put, start to take testimonies of people. They started
to look for witnesses that could stand up at those trials and say | was there, this is,
this what happened. They, we had right away Jewish doctors that participated right
away in Feldafing in the hospital with helping people. My children were delivered by
Jewish doctors. The people in their professions that people that were loyal so,
businessmen started somehow to, to participate in that field in the community. In
five years, you could see the difference in the people. When we left Feldafing, it
was already a different community. It wasn't just a victim community, it was already
a survivors’ community. That's the difference. And, | don’t know why there was no,
not too much documentation cause you would think that the United Nations Relief
would have all this papers on it, really. Being there | can just tell you of I, S, A, |
don't want to use the word inmate, inmate is maybe to strong, as | cannot use the
word citizen because | was not, | was a displaced person in that camp. So

much calories we received a day, | wouldn't know what to tell you.
Q: Tell me what it was like, | imagine that when your two children were born in
Feldafing, that it would be tremendously emotional for you, for your husband, for
your mother, [talkover] what do you remember of that, that sort of joys of having...
A: Well, | tell you. When my oldest daughter was born, my mother was so happy.
Although she was a girl, she could hardly wait to name her after my father. We
name after the dead in Jewish tradition. And although I’m sure she knew that
eventually | would have another child, there may be a boy, she could hardly wait to
have that name. And it was like a rebirth, rebirth, not just rebirth to the individuals, it
was a rebirth to the community. Every child that was born, it was not just your joy
but the whole house, like five, six families were excited about that. Now when our
son was born, that was really very, very special because Jack is the only survivor of
his family. He cannot even stand to listen to me talk about the Holocaust. But can
you imagine there was a Godin? He stood there and he just say, “Godin, Godin,
Godin.” That's all he was saying. That's all he was saying. He didn’t even and Ed
is named after his father. His name is Edward Isaac, Edward after my grandfather,
my mom's father, who died a natural death before the war and after Jack’s father.
My oldest daughter is named after his mother too, my father and his mother. We
always tried to give ‘em two names so people would, all those people would be

remembered. And that’s all | really remember and I'll tell you the truth. Even when
our grandson Gabe was born, our son’s son, Jack, that’s second time in his life that
| saw him, so emotional that that name Godin will continue. When the, | was
, | say, “Look at, look at him, he’s so cute, such a cute baby!”
, he said, “Godin, Godin, Godin,” that’s all he said. So it really, you
cannot describe those feelings. You really cannot describe those feelings because
something happens in a family. Even in our own community here when we had this
last spring were this poor people were killed. And | always says that this woman
had a Holocaust. The husband and the children killed in one day. Can you
imagine? Masses of families destroyed and you all grieve together and no
counseling. So each child that was born, each thing good that happened was like a
miracle, like a miracle. If somebody got married, you didn’t have brothers and
sisters to invite, you invited your, your, your neighbors that were your adopted
brothers and sisters. Up to this day, we have friends that we lived in the displaced
person camp together. They were strangers but they were our family. | just went to
Cleveland to see a lady that lived under us. We, our room was over hers and
unfortunately she never had children. When | went to see her now, she has
diabetes, she had a leg amputated and that’s all she was talking, she was saying,
“That's all | remember is Eddie running around upstairs with his little feet,” so.

already to make chicken soup and we didn’t. So she used to say, “Remember how

Highmand (ph) used to come and take Nina (ph) to eat a chicken soup and the

noodles with her hand,” so even now all those years later, my daughter's now 48

years old, she, she, this lady remembers that. So it was not just your own family

happening. It was all this joy was together. Together the sorrow and together the

joy.

Q: How would the early years be with children cause | imagine you would be so

thrilled to have them? But would that make you very protective? [talkover] Would

you have, what you had suffered, would that leave you with sort of psychological

scars?

A: Well | tell you. | spoke to some survivors and they said to me, “How could you

have a child after all that that happened? Weren't you afraid that somebody will

come and kill them?” | didn’t and | don’t know why | didn’t think so. Maybe, | never

thought that way. | was overprotective to my children, I'm still overprotective. Now

you, you, it may be stupid to say on the tape but I'll say it. You see this stupid
crocodile there? | always, when my kids go away on the beautiful vacation, | say
watch out for the crocodiles. And my daughter in law who’s a new daughter in law,
she’s lovely woman, to, my son was married and divorced and remarried and she
said, “There’s no crocodiles where we are going.’ And | said to her, “It's not really
the crocodiles, it's the memories. It’s the experience in life that | went through. It’s
the fears and anxieties and | call them crocodiles.” So she came back and brought
me a crocodile there, so, this is very normal. If you experience something, whether
a dog bites you or a disease, you're scared of it. You're scared of it. And we
survivors are all overprotective of, for our children. Always thinking something will
happen. Don't go here, don't go there and in reverse, our children are super kids.
They always are afraid to do wrong because they don’t want to hurt the parents.
When | was very young and talk with my son, he always said, “| never wanted you
to cry, mom. | always thought if I'll be bad and you will cry, | will hurt you and you
were hurt so much.” The most of the survivors are overprotective of the children
and in turn, the children are super achievers because they want to do good to their
parents because they suffered so much.
Q: Tell me about the Hebrew schools that were started in Feldafing.
A: Now in Feldafing they tried very hard to have different schools for the children.

As | said at the beginning, before we had children children, | mean tiny babies,
when the, some families that were in hiding, or had the opportunity to escape to the
Soviet Union, they came back with children. Among Holocaust survivors, there
were no children unless you had a child in hiding and you picked it up. So they
started schools. In the barracks there was no schoolhouse, in the barracks, in one
of the barracks and they had, there were some teachers from, that were teachers
from before the war that started to teach those children. Not just a Hebrew school,
the math and the language and history and they, they had some rabbis or rabbinical
students that taught them prayers, and taught them, it, it was from scratch. You
had a few kids of different ages, maybe you had two, three kids that were nine years
old and five kids that were twelve years old. So it was really difficult. Then as we
were, when my oldest daughter was three years old, two and a half years old, she
went to kindergarten. They started from the beginning. So then you had this type of
school. Then you had schools like for me. Kids that went at the age of 13 into the
camps, okay, | got married but | still wanted to go to school. So my mom was with
my daughter when she was already born and | went like to a night school like we
have here night school to catch up for what | did not have opportunity because of
the war. We had a vocational school. Also in one of the barracks, men were
learning locksmith, they were learning car mechanic, mostly women were learning

sewing. Mostly sewing because everybody said wherever you go, sewing will be
useful. There were courses, | remember even taking a course how to make
brassieres. Cause in Europe you made brassieres to order. There was no such
thing you went in bought already brassiere. So | was learning, | think | still have
upstairs the books of where | learned how to take. So there was very much really
organized, even a synagogue. We didn't have a synagogue per se. We used one
of those holes or one of those barracks as a synagogue where we came on the
holiday to pray. Now let's say Passover came. Well did we, could we order from
the bakery marker (ph)? It had to be done right there. Everything was like make
right there. They decided okay, we have this place, we have the oven, we'll make a
mattriss (ph). It was, everything was like new, like, like a beginning, like starting.
It's not that you moved in in a town where you can convert and say, okay, we going
to that school. And it was, | think, | think, that in the short time that we were in those
displaced person camps, a lot of wonderful things were done. The only thing
unfortunately that | feel that was not done is to give us counseling. There was no
such thing as counseling. But |! really don’t know when this counseling really came
into effect where people really started to believe that counseling is a good idea after
you live through a trauma. Maybe in those days they didn't believe in that. | really

some type of counseling and that was not.
Q: Would there by any kind of sharing that would, would one person sort of pour out
to another, maybe as you were sewing or [talkover]
A: Yes, well this is very true. As much as many of us felt we didn’t want to talk
about it, many times we said oh let's not talk about it, this is a terrible thing to talk
about, but every time we got together, whether we came to visit each other and
have a cup of tea together, or we walked, took a little walk together, we started to
compare our sufferings. Where were you, what did you do and in a way, that was
like a counseling because you poured out and you found out, gee, | wasn’t the only
one, there was others and others and others. Even when we came to the United
States because people, survivors did not have family. Okay, | had my aunt, my

Q: December the 14", 1975 and I’m Margaret West.
A: As | said, even when we came to the United States and we, | mean we the
survivors, even me, I'm talking personally, | wanted to, | wanted to talk about it.
Why did | want to talk about it? As | always say in the most horrible times during the
Holocaust, we used to sit and talk to each other, the women, hungry, cold, all the
women used to say, please don’t forget us. If you survive younger girl, tell the world
of what happened. And | kind as a young girl felt that | have to fulfill this promise.
So always wanted, always said, “Those women asked me to talk about it.” But
when | came to the United States, even my aunt who loved me, who helped me, my
cousins that were dear to me, they always said, you suffered enough, don’t talk
about it. So who did we, we talk to about it? Survivors to each other! We started to,
because we didn't have families, in, | was fortunate to have my mom, she became
like in our Washington area, the mom of everybody. Five, six couples, survivors
coming to our house on the Sabbath, having a little lunch, what did we talk about?
The Holocaust. Comparing each other's suffering, telling how it was, talking about
how by miracle we survived this selection and that selection and in a way, | think
this was really beneficial to us. Many times we say enough already talking
Holocaust but | think that this was good. At least we talked it out, we didn't keep it

inside. Now many times, people will say to me, as you know | go out to speak to

many, many schools and people will say, well it must become easier as you talk

about it. But this is not true. When | first started to talk about it, it was easier

because | unloaded my, what | had in my memory, in my feelings. But then as time

goes on, maybe it’s time to leave it to,to rest. At this point it’s like awakening

wound, reopening wounds.

Q: In your testimony you again and again show the compassional kindness that

was going on among Jewish people despite their suffering and, wonder if you'd

comment on, on that. To survive meant that you had to toughen yourself up and at

the same time there with that sort of compassion. In your testimony you talk and

give many instances, | think of your mother saying, this was when you were in the

ghetto, don’t go out after we get back from work because .. .

A: Yes.

Q: Others have lost their [talkover]

yourself up, you had no choice. You became really not tough but you became

through. But! tell you. | really feel, my personal feeling that it was of compassion of
all the women than me. Jewish women that I’m maybe here. Never forget, never
forget a woman that, her name was Mrs. Fivish (ph). | remember her name. She
was from my hometown. She used to call me over and say, “Nesa, come over. I'll
wrap your body in straw.” And first | thought what she crazy, why would she want to
wrap me in straw. | didn’t understand that this is insulation, that that will keep me
warm. Now did she save my life? Another time, | used to like to leave a little piece
of bread for the next morning and so | tore off a little piece of blanket, | wrapped it in
the little bite of bread. The whole bread was like one slice and if | ate three-fourths
of it, there was just one bite really of bread left over. And | wrapped it in that little
cloth and put it in the straw under my head. The next morning the bread wasn't
there. And | cried. | was a little girl, | cried. | cried, | was hungry. Another lady,
“Little girl, why you crying?” “Oh, | put my bread in the piece of cloth and maybe a
mouse came and, and ate it.” And she, | remember her saying, “Child, no mouse
ate your bread. People around us are hungry. Give me yout little bread, I'll put it in
my bosom and | will save it for you.” And you see, | had no bosom, it would have
fallen through. So she, every morning, she could’ve eaten up that bread, she, she
gave me, | used to go over and say, “Lady,” | even forgot her name now. I’m sure |
knew her name at that time. And | used to say, “Would you hold my little bread?”

And the next morning she, “Here child, here’s your little bread.” She could've
swallowed it. She was hungry too. Now did she help me? When | was beaten up
so severely on the death march, if it wouldn’t be for women that held me under my
arms and that’s all | heard ‘em say, “Walk. Don't give up, walk.” | really think that
there was a lot of compassion, a lot of help, a lot of moral support among the
inmates in the concentration camps. We always say oh, this one was bad, that one
was bad, here there were bad people too but most of the people were there for
each other.
Q: What, when you mentioned, | mean their bosoms, | was thinking of, for the first
time the fact that during these years you would've been maturing and sort of started
to have periods or perhaps not because you would be so badly nourished.
A: | never had my period. | got into the ghetto, was 13, | hadn't gotten my period
yet. And at that time, my mother always said she got her period a little later when
she was like 14 or whatever. But then in the ghetto the, because of malnutrition, |
never had a period until after liberation. | tell you truth, | had one period and then |
became pregnant so it was a miracle that | had even a baby. So, many times | talk
to, when | came to the United States, my gynecologist, talking about that and they
said if somebody's anorexic they don’t have their period. So we were starved. We
were starved. There is a myth that, | don’t know if it’s a myth, maybe it’s the truth,

that something was put in our food so we wouldn't have our periods. | don’t know. |
didn’t see a document on it. Could be. | know the men had like the same thing like
men in the army get. A certain thing, | don’t know what's called that’s put in in the
food, they shouldn't have any sexual urges. But for us women, somebody said that
there was something put in the food. But | think it’s just malnutrition that most
women didn't have their period.
Q: | wonder next if you’d talk a bit more about leaving Feldafing for the United
States. | know how long you had to wait, but tell me about the events as you
presumably had a final letter to say...
A: Okay, that, the final thing came that, the, as | mentioned before, we had already
finally the documents and | was pregnant with my son so again we had to wait until
he was a year old. So after he was a year old, well a year went by. We had to go
again to the medical examination cause no, they wouldn't let in any sick people in
the United State. So we had to go to the medical examination and then we were
taken to Bremen where this, where the ports are but we were outside of Bremen in
a place, | don’t remember anymore what the name of the place was: Weeldflecken
(ph) or something like this. It was like a camp where you stayed three or four
weeks, it’s like a quarantine thing to make sure that you are in good health. In that
particular place they, you have to go out to take certain lessons about how you're

going to be on the boat and a little bit about American, like a little Americanization

thing. And there we were already, thanks God, all of us together: my mom, my

husband, myself and the two kids. Three and a half years old and one year old.

And after the few weeks that we had to be there, we were put on a Army boat. It

was Called the SS Blatchford (ph). It was a General Blatchford (ph) boat called the

Army boat. Now | was assigned with the two children to be in a cabin. Women that

had children were in a cabin. Listen to that and you will understand, was that a right

thing to do or a wrong thing to do? My husband was separated, put into the hole in

the boat. Now my mom, because she was a single person and at that time she was

52 years old, she was assigned somewhere else. So to us, it was traumatic to be

separation. Whoever made this arrangement didn't think of it. Here we are going to

America and children separate, mother separate, husband separate.

Q: And big distances, | mean this...

A: Well, 1...

Q: Couldn't pop in on each other.

A: Wait a minute. We even had to eat in a different mess hall. The, we couldn't

even be together. Now | tell you, it was a long journey. | don't know, two weeks or

whatever we traveled on the ocean, | don’t remember even how long. It was such a

storm. One night | remember my mom coming up to me in the cabin and she laid

down next to me, she said, “My child, if we die in this ocean, let's at least be
together.” She said, “! don’t care if they’re going to throw me out, if they're going to
put me in a jail, I'm going to lay right here with you, with the children in the cabin.”
So |, as | thought, years later, we were excited to go to the United States but why
wasn't there a little compassion? Those people were separated from their families.
Why separate ‘em again? Poor Jack. He was laying there seasick. He was terrible
seasick. We thought they're going to throw him into the water, that's how sick he
was. He was by himself. Wouldn't have been easier for us to be together? So that
was the journey. We arrived in New York. Now when we came you didn't go to
Ellis Island, that was no more. You arrive there and you had to wait for your
documents to be processed. Now if you had family, then the family was allowed to
go into that room and my aunt and my cousin came from Washington, all the way,
to New York to wait for us and that was the most exciting thing that ever happened
to us. Cause here the dream came true. The, the family, at least one person of a
aunt and a cousin, for five years we didn’t know what that meant. And we slept over
one night in New York with some distant relatives and the next day we were in the
car traveling to Washington. | like to tell you this because it may sound stupid to
anybody but it’s a experience of newcomers. We are traveling in the car from New
York to Washington, they didn't have the turnpike at that time. You had to go ona

car, my cousin drives the car, he turns to me, he says, “Are you hungry?” | said,
“Yeah.” He says, “I'll get you some food.” He opens the door, he goes out of the,
the car and he comes back with some food. | couldn't understand how we are

ferry and the ferry was moving. Little things that you have an experience or
something that you could never forget. And we were, we came to the United
States, we came to live for a few weeks with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins
into their house. My aunt and my uncle were very kind. They had rented an
apartment for us the year before thinking that we were coming but because we were
not allowed to come until Ed was a year old, they had subrented it and it took two
more weeks for us to be able to go to that apartment. So we stayed in their small
house, they were very kind, they were very supportive, they were very sweet but
they didn't want to hear anything about a Holocaust.
Q: Why not?
A: Because my aunt said she had enough pain losing two sisters and two brothers
and she doesn't to diminish the joy of having a sister, a niece and her family. Now
she was right too, but, again, people come to us, survivors and they will say, “How
come you didn’t talk about your experiences?” Many of us were willing to talk but

no one would listen. So after being there for two weeks, we came into our own
apartment. Our apartment was at 529 LaMont (ph) Street in Washington, D.C., a
one bedroom apartment. We were my mom, my husband, myself and the two
children. We had a bed in the bedroom and a crib that someone had given to us for
Ed cause he was a baby. My mom and my daughter Panina (ph) was three and
half years old, slept in the living room on a couch. W were so glad to have two
rooms and a kitchen and a bathroom inside of the, cause in the displaced person
camp we still had to go to bathroom, we shared with other people a bathroom, so
this was really something special. And we just couldn't count enough our blessings,
to be here but then reality came. Reality came that we are in a new country without
professions, without money. We couldn't sit there although in the paper it said that
my aunt is going to support us but we couldn't expect them to support us and we
started to hunt for jobs. We were really not skilled although | learned a little bit at
sewing, | didn’t know, | didn’t know how to make a dress. Maybe | knew how to sew
a hem. Poor Jack, he was involved in the, in the displaced person camp working in
that kitchen, managing that kitchen. But what would he do here? He knew less
English than | Knew cause he was working already in the displaced person camp
while | was going a little bit to school. So this was very difficult. Lucky my aunt and

she could take care of the children, | could go to work. So through talking to some
neighbors in that building, | was asked to come for an interview in a place on
Connecticut Avenue. It was called the King Needlework Services. And to, the lady
was very kind, very compassionate, her name was Mrs. King and she really did not
worry too much that | didn’t know how to sew. She was willing to give me a job.
And that’s how we started to earn our living. And continue our life in the United
States bit by bit with the hope that we can give to our children a better life than we
had.

live in the United States. If my cousins didn’t invite me to go with them to the

eventually we saw that we couldn't meet in houses anymore so we decided to
make a little bigger group and meet in some kind of community center or whatever
and this is how our present Holocaust survivors group, Jewish Holocaust Survivors
of Greater Washington was created. From the little groups that met in people’s
houses, that played a little bingo together and shared Holocaust memories among
ourselves, that’s how organizations were created.
Q: How much of a gulf do you feel there is between Holocaust survivors and
others? | would think that you, being victims in a sense and you can never therefore
be like other people.

stand there and | tell them from my heart and my soul: | get up in the morning, | put
on my makeup, | put on my nice suit, | come to talk to them. | want to look like
them. | want to be like them. I’m American but I’m different. I’m a Holocaust
survivor. My dear friends, my dear, dear young lady, what we went through we can
never forget. We can never forget. Until | die, | will not forget this children selection.
Until | die, | cannot forget the cry of their mothers for them. | will never, never forget
that smell in Shtoodruff (ph) where they say was just a small crematoria. People
say to me Shtoodruff (ph) just had a small crematoria. Tens of thousands of human
beings, even before Jews were taken, euthanasia was practiced in Shtoodruff (ph).

would have college educations but in turn they did their share. They made sure that

want you to cry because you cried enough.” So we can proudly say, we have two
daughters that are teachers, our son a engineer and now thanks God we have five
wonderful grandchildren and we do have the most wonderful children in law. That
respect us, that support the work that we do and this Is very important.
Q: Are there ways in which, that the children you think have, are there other ways
in which they've been affected by your experiences? | was just thinking of how all
the activities of every day for you, are affected by your experiences. The, the
plentiful availability of food. [talkover]

the salad bar, there’s a line. | stand with my plate for food and all of a sudden | get
the chill. Why do | get the chill? It reminds me of standing in line for food. Many
times | will come back to the table with a empty plate. And whoever I’m there, they

will say, “Didn't you take any salad?” | say, “No I'll go later for it.”. Who would
understand that? Who would understand that? There, yesterday was cold, | was
going in the morning to the museum, my day to volunteer. Jack said to me, “Don't
forget your scarf.” And for that instant | thought of the cold weather without a scarf,
without gloves, without a coat, without . How can you not be affected?
Naturally if you were affected, it goes over to your children. If my children left food
on the plate, unconsciously | said, “Oh the kids in the Holocaust would've really
been happy to have that.” Or saying, “Please don’t waste food, there’s hungry
children in the world.” So it does carry over without even thinking about it, you
influence your children, your, when my grandchildren was little, | was sitting and
watching “The Wizard of Oz’, beautiful show, right? Beautiful show. And | was
sitting there enjoying, having a good time and there all of a sudden, was the
scarescrow, how did | pronounce it right? The guy that has the straw in him around?
[end of side 1 of tape 3] And there the scarescrow with the straw and there
reminded me of the days when | was wrapped in straw. So there’s really not a day
goes by that we are not affected by that Holocaust.
Q: What about nightmares? And | wondered too, does, does your husband Jack

night without nightmares, it’s very unusual. The difference is, when at first | used to
have those nightmares, was always with the hope that I’m finding my father, that I’m
finding a relative. Then those nightmares went away. Then | was running from the
Germans as a child, and as | get older, it’s terrible to say, sometime | dream that my
children are being taken, or my grandchildren. In your mind, all this get jumbled up
and you hear of really many Holocaust survivors that are getting old and all this, like
if they have dementia or something, all this comes mumble-jumble and they have
this terrible times. You cannot erase that.
Q: How did your mother do? | mean would she [talkover]
A: Well don’t forget when my mother died, she was just two years older than | am.
Not even two years. I'll be 68 in March, she was 69 and a half when she had the
brain hemorrage and she died. She was not really sick, she wasn’t a sick person.
We just, something happened and she had that brain hemorrhage and she, in three
days she was dead. So she also always dreamed and, about her son that she
didn’t, by the way my mother never got to see my brother, the one that was in
Russia. Never got to see him. After she died, like a week later, we had a letter that
he was let go and he would be coming to Israel. She never lived to know that he
would be free again. Too late.
Q: That would be...

A: That's | always, always regretted, | said, | wished that letter would have come
just one week earlier so she would have died knowing that he was free again.
Q: I’m jumping around again but | was, | wondered if you had, if you would have
had that, the bowl and spoon that I’m told that many people found it hard to give up
carrying that with them, after liberation | guess.
A: Well | want to tell you something. People don't realize what that bowl and spoon
meant. That was your lifeline. If many a times, if a soldier wanted to play around,
he took and shot a bullet through your, through your bowl. When you go to the
museum and see holes in those bowls, you think oh those are old bowls. If you look
carefully many of them have precise holes where a bullet went through. How did
you eat? You couldn't throw this away and go get another bowl. They didn't, you
couldn't say, excuse me my bowl has a hole. No such thing. So that became your
lifeline. We watched that spoon and that bow/l like, like, like the most precious thing
in the world. But as | told you, when | was taken to that hospital, everything, | don't
have anything, anything, anything, to show, or to share from that time. See some
people that were a little older maybe had the wisdom to save something. Or even in
the hospital to say, can | have back my bowl? But | didn’t understand to say that.
So | didn’t. | Know some people that went back on a visit to Auschwitz, just in, ten
years ago, five years ago and they were able to purchase there, they have like gift

shops there where you can purchase things. Just like a memorabilia, so they, they
did that. But like | have, I’m sure you heard my testimony about the money with the
cat with the document. And | have a stupid little cat sittin’ there on my,
on top of my china closet and many time people walk in, how come you have that
stupid little cat sittin’ there? But that is a symbol of my life. But | did not have the
wisdom at that time to save anything, so | didn't, but | can understand that people
didn’t want to give up that bowl and that, that spoon. Honey if you gave up that, that
spoon you could still manage without a spoon but that bowl, that food for, the dish
for food, you were dead if you didn’t have that.
Q: You talked earlier about being numbed rather than being toughened and |
suppose the, clinging to your bowl and spoon as a survival thing would be
something that would be the natural thing to do and also | was thinking of how, in
many other ways I'm sure, just as when you were in the barn and the guards had
gone, you would be too close to death, too numbed to immediately realize what was
happening.
A: Exactly, you, you really didn’t know what was happening to you from one minute
to the other. You didn't know, even all through the ghetto, the, the traveling to the,
the deportation, the concentration camp, the labor camp. You never knew what,
what was going to happen next. Whether there, you went to work, you came back,

you went to sleep, next day you could be dead. They could kill you, they could take
you to selection. You, unpredictable. And you just don't know. It’s like | say, |
prayed, | prayed every night to live through the night and every day to live through
the day. You never knew. Some people say why didn’t you run away? To run away
you need a place to run to. My brother was lucky he had that friend to run to.
Nobody wanted me, | tried to run and, and, and people that tried to run many times,
the neighbor said, here goes the Jew, shoot him. Why did they do that? So you
become numb and you just pray to live through and if you have the, the, well it’s, it’s
the animal in us that wants to live, survival. This is the bottom line. The bottom line,
nobody wants to be dead.
Q: Right and in fact, you were forced to live at an animal level.
A: That's right.
Q: You, you spoke in your testimony about at least in the ghetto being fortunate in
having plenty of water.
A: That's right. [talkover] We could bathe...
Q: Right.
A: In the ghetto we were, we, on the outskirts of the city. There were wells, nobody
could close the well there but in, |, | think | was a year without | took a bath. Almost
a year without taking a bath.

A: Can you imagine that?

Q: Well we, you, tell me what that would be like. | mean your [talkover]

A: Well at the beginning, [talkover], you're infested with lice all over. You itch.

People are sitting there picking, like you see the monkeys in the tree picking from,

from their bodies. If you were with one of your family, maybe they were picking it

out of your head like the monkeys sat there and pick. If not, you sat and you picked

your own. You got infected from that. That's how we had this, those one typhoids, |

don’t know which one, typhoid or typhus that comes from the lice. It’s a infection

like. It, it was just unbelievable. | cannot believe now sometime | close my eyes

and | think, | hope that was a dream. Cannot, you cannot believe what things we

went through. |, | don’t remember if my originally

testimony, you, you listened to that. We were on the death march and we were

sitting there so hungry, so hungry, so thirsty. Women were eating a little bit snow,

then all of a sudden | saw women were running to something in the snow so | ran

too. | didn’t even know what | was running for and that, there was some blobs in the

snow and everybody grabbed a piece and | grabbed a piece and then we, so

women were washing it in the snow, so | washed it in the snow. What was inside’? It

was manure for cow. And when a cow eats, they, she doesn’t digest the grain. So

when they had straw, there was a little grain and the women said, “This is
nourishment. Let's open those little grains, wash them in the snow and eat ‘em.”
And we ate ‘em. Now if somebody on the outside would have looked on to us, they
would say look at those animals! Look what they're doing! But | think we did the
most wonderful thing that there is to do in humanity. God says if you save one life,
it's like you would have saved the whole world? We saved our lives. We did the
most precious thing that there is although it looked terrible.
Q: Just as you would go for a couple of years, would it be without any water,
without any bathing [talkover]
A: In my case was about a year. Because not even quite a year, from June til
March. Because when we came to Shtoodruff (ph) to the concentration camp, we
had that bath. And then we didn’t a bath no more until | had the disinfectant poured
on me after liberation so let’s say eight, ten months, yeah? Ten months without a
bath. They gave us a little black coffee, sometime we washed our hair with it.
Cause in my camp, they didn’t cut our hair when we came to Shtoodruff. They
would have done us a favor if they would've cut our hair. But they didn’t. So there
you were head a hair, no scissor to chop it off and that’s a place where the, the, the
first thing you get infected. It, it was just terrible and the same little dress. The only
good thing which was a bad thing, we were in, in those, in those tents that

Q: Told your story...

A: Yeah.

Q: It seemed to me that...

A: Yeah, |, | don’t know if | ever told that story [talkover] but when we came

[talkover] how important they were. When we came to Shtoodruff (ph) and we went

through that shower so-called, and we stood outside for a long time naked and then

we were given a dress, a pair of underpants, a pair of shoe. They just threw it to us.

They didn’t say what size or whatever. Somehow, usually as a rule, you didn’t get

your own, any of your own clothing because they figured if you get something of

your own maybe you have something sewn in or hidden but somehow our group of

women got the same shoes. How do | know that we got the same shoe? | was, in

my, what | was handed was a pair of like oxfords, like a woman’s pair of oxford. Big,

nice oxford. | came wearing boots. Why did | came with the boots? Because there

was a gold coin sewn into the boots and as we were being deported and we were

not allowed to take along too much, my mother said, “Put on the boots.” So you, so

there, | see a woman, already we were settled in the camp. After a few days went

and tell her it's my boots, she'll suspect that | have something in there so | didn't say
a thing | just kept on being around her. She came over, she says, “Little girl, do me
a favor. Let’s exchange. You have a little foot, those boots maybe will fit you.” And

shoes may fit me. You don't want an old lady to go around without, without shoes.”
And | exchanged with her. And this is how | got my boots. Now | put on those
boots and | never took them off. | kept them on my feet because of that stupid gold
coin. | was afraid somebody will steal my boots and | have this gold coin. Now as |
mentioned before, | was with my sister in law who was not really yet my sister in
law, in the camp at that time together and she knew about this gold coin. And | kept
on asking her, she was seven years older than me, | said, “Laina (ph) what do you
think? Maybe we should exchange this, this gold coin and get some bread.” And
she said, “Let's wait. Times may become tougher. Times may become tougher.”
Now | was liberated in, with those boots because when time became tougher, no
one had extra bread to exchange for a coin. So after | was taken to that so-called
hospital, they had to actually cut off, cut up the boots to take off from my feet

because my feet were frozen and almost like stuck to those boots. Never saw that
coin again. And those boots.
Q: Nesse, | wondered to what extent in the, during the war when you were
wandering, you might say without your mother, do you remember getting strength
from thinking about your old family life? And | wondered to what extent that loving
family, your mother was very charitable, | wondered to what extent that was sort of
feeding your spirit?
A: Not just thinking about your family but thinking about all this that there was. |
remember in those worst of times, this lady that, that wrapped my body in straw, this
Mrs. Fivish (ph). She used to sit down and say, “Let's reminisce. Let's think of
home. Let's think of our families. Let’s think of the Sabbath and the candles,” and
some women used say, “What you talking all this nonsense!” She used to say, “If
we don't, if we stop thinking of what we had, we'll lose everything.” She was a very
wise woman. She, she’s, survived the Holocaust and | never saw her but she had
she was also in Russia and in Israel, she was very wise woman. And
she used to say, she always said, “Let’s dream, let’s hope. If we give that up, then
we don't have anything left.” And | think she was very smart by giving us younger
people something to hope for. She encouraged us all the time, she used to say,
“Think of the good times, think of your mother, think of all that,” and this was really

and people always tell you, if you have a problem, think of something wonderful. |
know, | had to have some surgery on my ankle, years ago, and the doctor said to
me, “Think of flowers when you go to, when | put you to sleep so you'll have a
pleasant dream.” So even in worse times, you need that hope. You need that,
something precious to hold onto, that you want it back and you hope for it.
Q: Would you ever sing together or pray together?
A: Yeah, oh, sing together all the time. In the worst of time, we used to sit and,
and, some people just say, “You crazy, you're singing again.” The, this lady, or this
we used to say, “Well, let, let’s sing a little something of hope. Let's make a little
prayer of something.” Somebody else say, “Ah, what you praying, what you
praying, nobody listens to you, you had all this.” But we believed. | believed. |

that most people, today in Christian religions follow psalms and there is a psalm, |

and the earth for, for the people on earth. And | always used to think, the people on
earth are bad but God will come with the heavenly bodies and stop those bad
people from doing bad things. | always hoped. | really did. | hoped until | saw

be free. This will end. This will end. It cannot be forever. So we used to sit and
hope and pray. | remember a, that year in the labor camp on Yom Kippur, you
know Yom Kippur is our holiest of holidays and who knew it was Yom Kippur? We
didn't even know it was, one lady said, “You know it's Yom Kippur tomorrow.” And
people say how do you know? She said she made some markers or whatever. So
we believe its Yom Kippur. Now we were hungry, we were not eating anyway. You
had nothing to eat. They said, “Let’s pray.” Now nobody knew the prayers were
Yom Kippur so people started to make prayers. A prayer on bread, a prayer, any
kind of prayer that they could think of, thank you God for the bread, thank you God
for this, they, nobody really knew the Yom Kippur prayer. But we prayed. Never,
never forget it and | remember people saying, don't tell the Germans that’s Yom
Kippur because every time when we had a holiday, they always came to kill people.
SO we were very afraid they shouldn't know it was Yom Kippur.
Q: Is there any song that you particularly remember? | wondered if there’s anything
you, do you sing? Do you want to...
A: Well | want to tell you. I’m avery poor singer. | love to sing and we have a song
that, it’s called the Partisan Song that was created in one of the ghettos. That it
says, never say you're going the last road. It’s true that the clouds are covering the
blue days but there will come a day to say we are here. We are here.

Muzainundoor (ph). Muzainundoor (ph). Means we are here. You, ask me.

Q: What, what was a day like in Feldafing?

A: Well it, in, a day in Feldafing, when we first came, as | said, we were very

restricted. We were not allowed to go out to the city, just a certain time. We were

not allowed to go take her, buy a, well we didn’t have money. Maybe if we would've

had money we could take, buy a ticket and go to town, to Munich. At the beginning

was not. But later on, your life became pretty much good life. You had your child,

you had your mother, you had a husband, you okay, you didn’t have an apartment,

you didn't have, you couldn't go into the store and shop or like we do now, three pair

o shoes in one month. But your life was pretty much scheduled. The only thing

that really was bad, you still didn’t know where you are. You were a displaced

person. You were praying to belong to some country, somewhere, like with us. We

went for checkups, we thought we are leaving, no. Again, our hope was up. We

think, we thought we were going. No. So all this was the uncertainty. The

uncertainty was going to, are you ever going to be able to leave the displaced

person? This hung over you. But otherwise, human beings, young people fell in

love. People had children. People I'm sure died. People were born, people had

weddings. It, it became a pretty so-called in parentheses normal life.

privacy. [talkover]

A: No privacy, no, not really no privacy.

Q: But you know in fact, | would think that your mother became Jack’s mother too

in a strange way.

A: Oh, she, people, oh, everybody thought it was his mother. Because we naturally

asked, when | found her she was precious, but then if she started to tell me how to

raise my kids or what to do, you open your mouth sometime. And then you're sorry

but Jack, never opened his mouth to my mother. Ma, ma, ma, ma, that’s all to, to

respect, she, well naturally you didn’t have the privacy for husband and wife, but

you see we managed to have two kids with my mother living with us in one room.

Q: Yes. But there would be countless adjustments like that and things...

A: Yeah, naturally, naturally.

Q: In your last months in Feldafing, the, the numbers of displaced persons there

must have been dwindling. Would you, would you have been there as others were

leaving for new lives in Israel or Australia or Britain?

A: | want to tell you, it was dwindling and it was not dwindling. Because some other

smaller camps were being eliminated so they brought from different, | forgot now

from which camps, they brought people. They resettled them to, to Feldafing. Now

and shipping them off to the United States, did they have to ship them to another
displaced person camp? |, I’ve always thought of that. | always thought, is United
States so little that they don’t have room to take and there wasn’t many Holocaust
survivors. But people were leaving, you were a little bit jealous when you saw
people leaving. Then you heard people were going to Israel on illegal immigration
and some of them didn’t succeed and came back and there were different times
even in the five years after the war, after the war ended. It was different
experiences. But I’m really surprised that there isn’t more documentation on
Feldafing.
Q: How much, in your community there at Feldafing, how much discussion or how
much frustration would there be because you'd suffered so much and still the world
was not opening its arms?
A: That's all people talked in Feldafing is when do we go, where do we go? What
country, maybe opportunity country and some people were looking. We didn't have
money to pay off, some people said well, maybe if we would have money, we would
hire a German lawyer or an American lawyer. Somebody used to say well,
somebody in the, in the United States consulate maybe could help you. You tried to
find somebody, somewhere that could help you. That’s all people talked about:

us, | think, without counseling, we picked ourselves up, we found a spot in the

more compassion, a little more understanding. We're not throwing our memories,
