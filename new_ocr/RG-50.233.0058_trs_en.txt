pl ... fifteen minutes later they were already gone because they were
told cme y ORS going to einklausen[ph]2, that they are going to
bath. I was by faith[ph3], naturally, but it’s a nature. Everytime
when I’m sick or when I’m troubled, I always say, "Please G-d, help
me. What shall I tell it to. I have nobody else. I can’t say,
"Jesus Christ, help me," because I don’t believe in it. IT was
brought up in a very religious home so I say, "Please G-d, help me.
I can’t forgive that for what he let happen to our people. My boss
» (D in the =p — ee ise SSE OT 10T he died about seventeen years
, ago, I think. I used to see them, I worked for five years. I was
next to him. I was the top secretary. I have a letter here. We
used to talk about it. He was not religious but he only ate kosher
meat. I said, “Why kosher meat?" He said, "I want, to have some
sign that I’m a Jew so at least I eat kosher meat."!'"T was operated
two months ago. T had a terrible infection going up ----------
[17]. I took out five teeth. I had to be in the hospital because
it infected my sinus and if I don’t remove and drained I would get
it in my brain. So I talk to you and I laugh and I feel terrible.
They want two thousand dollars for fixing it so for the time being
I’m without teeth, so forgive me. So I said to him, Mr.
Gladstone[ph21], he was a very very intelligent man. very bright.

He was a “---="“[22]very nice. I said, their was no G-d in
Auschwitz, you know that. He said, I agree with you but what do
you want me to do take G-d to torah, take G-d to court? He says
after the war in 1946 all the pen men, all the writers and poets
went to France, to Paris. They got together from all over the
world. And there was Rabbi Herzog the head ga’on from Israel. Was
it Rabbi Herzog? What was his name?
Herzog, yeah.
I think so. With a big beard[27]. He was sitting with Rabbi
Herzog in Paris in a little restaurant having tea or coffee and
talking about it and he said to Rabbi Herzog, Rabbi Herzog, where
. was G-d in Auschwitz when they took a million innocent children and
tortured gassed and burned them. Where was he? How could you
plead G-d Almighty so good full of mercy because when you davin in
schull you say G-d, full of mercy. So the Rabbi said, all right so
what do you want me to do take water in toilet. Who am I, to
judge? So he told me the same thing what the Rabbi told him. I
said I don’t care. He said you know what it is Molly, it’s like a
little hill of ants. A man goes and puts his foot on the ants and

and they had to stay in line for bread and people used to die and
my mother told me at night when it was quiet they used to risk
their life and go and bring them bread and sugar and wood to heat
their stoves. So the goyim despite the fact that my father was so
religious, they loved him, - Pan[ph192] Bastocki, Pan Bastocki, Mr.
Bastocki in other words. I hear them - he had a nice ??[193] you
see. They had the highest respect for him because he did a lot for
the Christians and I had girl from [??195] the top floor of our
building, Yeneshk[ph195] her father became the finance or the
educational minister of Poland in our town and she was my
girlfriend and they were very classy people and they were very
intelligent people but there were very few you could count them on
the fingers. The rest of them....You see the classy people they
knew that the whole thing about Jesus and the whole thing ???[202]
of baloney, you know but they made the peasants believe that the
Jews are guilty, killing their God and that’s what you get from the
???204]. Because why? For, example, a Jewish man and a goy, poor
people, I mean the plain’??[205] they used to go to work in the
same factory, right. On Friday was pay day so the Jew got the pay
day and the goy got the pay day. So the Jew went at home to the
little "kleine haizel" [ph207] in a little place in a little room
and the wife had washed the floor and put wood shavings or what you
call to keep it dry and clean and had a couple of candles burning
and whatever she had she made the piece of chicken or whatever or
fish and the children, old clothes but what was clean and repaired
and he would bring her the money and she would manage everything.
The goyim when he got the pay day he went right away to the bar, to Ly
the beerhouse or whatever they call it in the shenk[ph214] and he" ©
would sit and drink until three o’clock in the morning-and no money ' \"*
was left. And then he would come home and the wife would - it was aa
dark and "finster"[ph215] and his wife was crying and saying, Jan aoe
where is the money, what happened to your pay day so he would beat
, her up. She said but look at Chaim, look how nice, ...??[218] poor
people, a candle burning and it’s warm in the house and the kids
| are clean and they had some food on the table. He says you know
why because the Jews are thieves. They steal our money. That’s
why they have and we don’t have it. And that’s how the legend
started that the Jews are thieves, that the Jews are not murderers
but they steal from the poor and they take it for themselves. And
that’s how antisemitism spreads. What you teach the children the
children teach their children. So Jan was starving only drunk to
death and Chaim was having a piece of bread or whatever he had and
he had it on his table. And that’s how it started, you see but
aristocracy did it on purpose because they didn’t want to pay the
people too much money. People used to work for peanuts. But the
Jew started to make the best he could with this. Even the Rabbi
was starWing[?230]. But Rabbi was eating in our house because he
couldn’t afford to make a Shabbos meal. And the goy loved to
drink. They’re known for their alcoholism, the Polaks and the
Germans and the British and???f231]% And the Jews never touched
alcohol. The Jew if he’d like, once in a bar mitzvah or someplace
was in ... [133] because they had to have clean

2 start to get unhappy. Nobody got paid for what they did.

(f ~ [indistinct 157]- justice. And you have - antisemitism is very
high you can write.

, What do you remember about antisemitism?

O’kay in 1934, 1933, ‘34 when Hitler came to power in Germany, in
Wilno, Poland all the students, they had a big university, Stephen
Baturilphi62]. They had the ??[163], how do you,say in English, -
swastikas were on the windows and [indistinct164] talk about
aristocracy with the beautiful - students [???165] and I remember
when I was fifteen years old, you save that picture in that little
garden what I showed you, you couldn’t get in anymore.
No Jews allowed?
No, 2?2??[167] Christian that time, anyway, they used to go around
with stick, students’ sticks and in their hand would stick, they
had razorblades and they used to attack the Jewish people if
they’re going in the park and cut them with the razorblades.
This was in ‘33, ‘34?
In ‘33, '34 that’s when Hitler came to power in Germany, the Nazis™
came to Wilno.and they used to scream - they used to stay by the
door of our store and scream, don’t buy by the Jewish [spoke in
Polish 175]. Don’t buy anything from the Jews. They used to stand
by the door and not let in...
In front of your store?
Right, and other stores, too, not just our store and not let in no
Christians to shop.
Did people obey that? Did people not come in?
90% and they all wanted the blood from Jews. That’s all what they
wanted.
Were you in a Jewish neighborhood?
Well, there wasn’t, such a - no, I wasn’t in Yidisha????[180] that’s
what the Jews [indistinct180]. I was in a very classy - across
where I lived like the building here there was a court and we had
doctors and lawyers and [7182]. The society of Wilno’s aristocracy
lived where we lived, you see because what the street [indistinct
183] by the famous poet [??184] the street and my mother had some
friends who were very classy because I wasn’t born then so from the
first World War my mother used to --- it was against the law to ---
we had bread and we had everything and there were - I remember
[2???188] there was a family who was very aristocratic Polish family

with beautiful terraces. That building don’t exist. They bombed
the whole - I was told after the war from people who went there to
g visit. They said Molly, you wouldn’t recognize it, all burnt and
oye the way the Russian built those houses like square that time
pf ~findistinct 126] ceilings and beautiful decorations. And the
terraces were so gorgeous. You don’t make it in the states like
that, too expensive. It’s the beautiful architecture
a [ indi et ine t 13 0 | . es es ee a .
You lived in this whole building?
No, no. On the main floor there was the store and the bakery and
the second floor was our apartment overlooking the
Buffaloberg[ph131], the famous mountains, Buffalo mountains like
Buffalo, you know, Buffalo mountains. Later on they made a big
stadium for soccer one of the biggest stadium there is. From our
window you can see the Buffalo Mountains. What else? I attended
the Hebrew Gymnasium, you have it this, right? And then I
graduated it was 1938 and I got married. Now wait a moment. 1938
.j%, I was - I was eighteen years old, right? So that’s right, because
I was seventeen and a half, eighteen. And then I got married and
the war broke out.
So you were married in ‘39?
Yeah, right, in the beginning of ‘’39, March or April, I don’t
remember exactly when. And then the war broke out and then I had
a baby; it says here when I had a baby you can look it up. I don’t
remember when it was.
When did the Nazis come into Wilno?
1941. They made a pact with Stalin. So we still were under the
Bolsheviks, you see. And in June 1941 this was suddenly became
without any - because they caught the Russians unexpectedly and
they killed them, 22 million Russians they killed in the war. June
1941 the Nazis came in. I remember how the Polak was excited that
they saw them. They were so happy with them. They
should...[indistinct 150].
Because they were unhappy with Stalin.
No.
They thought that Hitler was going to...
Yeah, three years later they realize when 1943, 1944 they were
crying their head off. But for the first couple of years they were
excited. First of all they will get rid of the Jews and everything
what the Jews had they will take it which they did you see so they
were very happy. But then they ate up everything what the Germans
-- and then the Germans made them go to work and they didn’t like

_ be? You are the young people. You have to stand. What can you
,/£ do?. I took out some pictures.
I‘d like to get a complete history from you.
Well, you have it here’ Can you read this? It’s very tough to
read because it’s condensed, but you can read this here.
Okay
As I said it’s a very condensed history. Now this picture is
terrible. It’s smeared. This is me ~--~-------~-[87]. Okay let’s
forget. Nu eb ee
That’s important. I’11 listen to that.
I went to Gymnasium Rialys, it was called. I went to BSE a ae
[89]. Do you want to know the street, too? Zolwana[ph89] That
would be in Polish, Zolwana Street in Wilna, at the Polish time.
I graduated it was I think in 1938 but I think you have it there.
And I got married in ‘39. The war broke out I think in September
or October of ‘39 and I was marrried I think it was in April. I
don’t even remember when I was married. You know how stupid young
people are. I got pregnant and I didn’t even know. And I lost my
husband and my brother at the same time. They were running away.
My baby had temperature. She got sick so I didn’t go. So they ran
,o, and were caught and shot by the Nazis. I’m not sure if you have it
:°“in this. We were five sisters and two brothers. And we lived in
Wilna until the war broke out. Just before the war broke out I got
married and in 1941 my husband and my brother right away were
killed and then my older sister with her children. They don’t
| like this long too. They make it very abbreviated.
It is very abbreviated.
Yes, so what would you need to know? I was one of seven children
in a very very religious home, in a very very happy home.
Your father owned a grocery store and a bakery.
Yes. My father was a grain merchant but he was a rabbi. He was
very religious., okay. We had a grocery store and a bakery on
Portowa Street. And this is in Wilna. Wilna;s7-5---[115]. Now
it’s Wilna----------------------[121] )

amillion ants got killed by his foot but some of them survived and
that’s what happened, he said, to our Jewish people. That was his
interpretation. And yet had memorized, I have his book with the
poetry what he talks about this. JI can Séttle2it not forgive and
never forget. And my daughter, I never talk to her about my past
because it’s too gruesome. I didn’t want her to know what people
, can do to other people. She was going to medical school here in
‘40 John Hopkins. She didn’t tell me nothing. She just eloped with a
‘goy’ and got married then John Hopkins University. Now she’s
divorced with three kids and I almost had a heart attack right then
because she was my only child, and she has a Masters in Science.
She works in the National Institute of Health. But she also ruined
her life. She was fourteen years with that man. So the middle one
said, Grandma we’re half Jews and half Christians. The oldest one
said, he’s ten years old now, he knows a little bit about the Nazis
and bad people and he hates them; he said Grandma I hate all those
people, I’m Jewish. He the oldest one said it because I ---------
[53] by a very religious moel. But I can’t talk to them about all
those things . I can’t talk to my daughter about it because if she
could have run away witha "goy" and leave it me, I have nothing to
say. Who am I? In my heart I know what it is but the world
forgets everything. This is very good what they’re doing. I hope
to G-d that they wouldn’t demolish this memorial place because here
we're going ten years from now...the blacks hate the Jews too. The
Jews sacrificed the young Jewish men, remember Goodman and some
other one who were killed in Mississippi? Jewish people sacrificed
their life for them, but they still hate the Jews. Jackson, the
one who was running for President hated the Jews. We have that
other guy, what’s his name, he’s a priest, pastor..
Sharfton
Beside him. No there’s the other one, the muslim.
Farrakhan
Farrakhan. He hates the Jews. At Purim he said what kind of
religion is this. Because the Arabs give them so much money they
do everything for the Arabs. That’s what they’re doing. They’re
preaching everything for the Arabs. So wherever you turn, they
hate the Jews and I would like to know the reason. O’kay the
Yankees[66] when I was a kid used to tell them because they killed
our G-d. Why do the Arabs[67] hate the Jews? In Germany he said ,.. '
this porter[68] who was on television said we saw that -2@-“4 lo taai wen
--[69] said the union or the Jews are running the world and we are
going to get rid of them. So the reporter said that’s not true.
The Jews are not running the world. And this was a Christian. So
the only place which is a little civilized in that respect is the
United States. Yet.there is so much hatred from blacks and muslims
and goyim’“4++*--" [73]. What’s going on? What’ going on in this
world? After all this hell. I remember when I was liberated I
said to myself, now everybody will love each other. People will
embrace and kiss each other. There will be no more hatred. "A
nechtica tug." This happened all over again. So what’s going to

They ??235]. They couldn’t drink for that simple reason. But if
you classy people more aristocratic people they knew but they
didn’t fight, they didn’t give a hoot. They loved Pan Bastocki
because the doctors loved mine father. ???[238] my brother-in-law
used to hide all the Lithuanians from the Bolshevik what Poland
took away from Lithuania the capital city so Lithuania was fighting
them, you see. So if they would come to Lithuania in Wilno they
| would arrest him so my brother-in-law used to hide out very famous
22?[242]. So when the war broke out ???[very indistinct243] they
= was hiding him for awhile. I can talk till tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow even and never finish so what did we got there? See
this is a book written - this is worth a fortune because there’s no
other one like that. I’m very mad. I will tell you what the
reason is. | |
