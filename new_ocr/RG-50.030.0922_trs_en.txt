Q: Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and it took a while sometimes for the news
to get to the various places where people were imprisoned. And then after that 1t took a while
until people were finally settled in their final place. So I would assume that probably the second
half of 1941 beginning of 1942 might be about what time you were, about the time, but I’m
assuming. Do you have a sense of how many years you were in Tajikistan.

Interview with Regina Plawner 83
A: No, no.
Q: Yours is an unusual destiny from most, I mean not unusual for all those people who
experienced it but you were caught between two great powers. And what kind of, how did that
shape you as a person? What kind of effect did it have because you were experiencing this
through some of the most vulnerable years that a child has. That is starting out as a child and
ending up as a young teenager. And those are very impressionable years.
A: Well first of all, when my children were growing up we never talked about it, specially my
husband. He never talked about the concentration camp and we didn’t, we wanted the children to
grow up normal without fear. And when they became, they got let’s say 14, 15 years they started
learning in school. That’s when we started discussing all this and they got to know everything.
And they grew up knowing the way children should.
Q: Without the fear.
A: without the fear, but you know they also have a love for Israel and for, for the way I did.
Q: I take it you have gone to Israel. Did you ever live there?

Q: We’re coming to the end of our interview. Can you tell me. Do you have any, first of all is
there anything that we missed that you would like to share from what we’ve talked about today.
A: No, not really. I think within this period of time, the two hours, I think we covered a lot of
things. Of course there’s many more stories that can be told but I think we covered most.
Q: Are there any thoughts that you’d like to share with others who do not know much about the
experience of the Jews who ran east and then ended up being caught in the Soviet Union and
forcibly deported. Or what would you like them to know about your experience.
A: Well my experience is that you know no place is safe. Nobody knows what’s tomorrow and
we have to make the best of every day and of course the hope Israel will be strong and safe and
the same for the United States cause I love the United States and you know to raise their children
in a, in amore Jewish way and to know what war can do to them.
