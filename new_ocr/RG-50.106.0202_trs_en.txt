December 21, 2012
Q: Did you hear about him when you were a little boy of eight years old?
A: No, no, no. I did not no. I did not know because this was the time I was too small to
understand what was going on and nobody talked about it.
Q: Did you speak German?
A: I, yes. I speak, actually I spoke both, German and Czech.
Q: Then you are living with your mother and then what happened. When did things, the next
thing?
A: Things actually changed very late. And this was of -- because of the factory actually got out
of business in 1937. This was the time before Hitler. And so my father actually was only the
counsel of Uruguay and this was his job for the time when Hitler came in. And so actually my
father, because of his job was actually higher job and so actually he got through the Holocaust I
think a little bit, I little, just a little bit later, just in 42. But —
Q: Let’s stay in the 1930s for the moment. Ok. Now were you aware of the September 1938
Munich agreement, with Chamberlain and so forth.
A: Oh of course I were. Yes.
Q: You were 13 years old.
A: Yes, I was but I was aware of that, yes.
Q: Do you remember talking about it with your parents or what your feelings were?
A: Actually I did not have the opportunity to talk to my father about this because I think my
father was trying to hold me out of this thing. So I actually I told, I talked about this just with my

mother. And my mother was I think not the right person to explain all these things to me. So
actually I got my information just from other people and what I actually find out by this time, by
the newspapers or by the radio.
Q: What were your thoughts? Do you remember what — were you frightened? What kind of —
A: No I was, I was never frightened.
Q: You weren’t.
A: I was never frightened. I was just, just getting aware of that with my father will be in the
future something happens. And actually it happened then yes. But I could not, I was too young
actually to make a decision or to tell my father it will be better to stay out of the country or go
away. And my father was still very I think sure of that, that because he 1s a counsel, nothing can
happen to him.
Q: But he was staying in Brno still?
A: He was still staying in Brno. This was a mistake.
Q: At that time, in 38, what did Hitler mean to you as a 13 year old boy?
A: Actually he meant very much to me because at the time when the Germans came in, so
actually immediately they, because of my appearance, yes, they could think that I am Jewish.
Q: Oh really.
A: So when I met some soldiers for example in the streets or outside of my home, so they started
to ask me about that. So I was very well aware that what’s going on. And what can happen in the
future.

December 21, 2012
Q: Imean you were a young boy. You’re talking about the spring of 1939 when the Germans
came in.
A: Yes, yes. That was the time. Because this was actually the time that I could understand what’s
going on. I was at that time 14 or 15 years old and at that age you can understand what’s going
on. And the second thing was that yes, what was your —
Q: Could you understand Hitler’s speeches? Did you ever hear any of Hitler’s speeches?
A: Oh yes, I heard it. I heard, I heard very much of these speeches because my mother was
listening to him. And we could understand this very well and we were aware what’s going on.
Q: Did you talk these things over with your other school friends?
A: No. Never.
Q: Why not?
A: Because at that time I was in the Czech school and there in the Czech school there were the
political talking, yes. Amongst the children, the students, yes. Was actually not, not common.
Q: Do you remember spending time with non-Jewish children your age? Did you do sports and
things like that?
A: With not Jewish?
Q: Yeah, your friends who were not Jewish. Did you have non-Jewish friends?
A: Of course, I had not Jewish friends, but I had even Jewish friends because at that time when I
started to go to the gymnasium this was the late 30s, so I had Jewish friends. Later I did not. I
think from 1940, when I changed from the gymnasium to the chemical school yes, at the age of

https://collections.ushmm.org

15, so I actually had no Jewish friends anymore. Because at that time no Jewish people were in
the class with me.
Q: Were you interested in sports?
A: Oh yes, I am interested in sports from my very —
Q: What did you do when you were that age in sports, with the non-Jewish students?
A: With the not Jewish. Actually I started doing some athletics and from 1940 I started to swim.
Q: Let’s get to 1940. So now you’re in, you said you’re in a chemical school.
A: Yes. I can tell you why. Because at that time, in 1940 it was forbidden for people with a
parent, with a Jewish parent, to go to the gymnasium to the higher classes. It was allowed only
to go to a chemical school or to a, to a what we called actually not a gymnasium, yes. And I
don’t have the right expression for it now. It’s —
Q: What were your thoughts when you couldn’t go to the, they told you, you couldn’t go to the
gymnasium anymore?
A: No, actually it was not bad because I decided at that time I want to be a chemist. So this was
actually was not actually something I didn’t like or something like that. I wanted to be a chemist.
Q: Did other Jewish students go with you, switch?
A: No, no Jewish people was in my class anymore.
Q: Oh right you said they were not in class anymore. But there were other half Jewish students
still in the class.

happened. But —
Q: Did you know what was happening in the rest of Europe, what Hitler, what the Germans were
doing in the rest of Europe?
A: Of course, I know yes. I knew about it because my father actually was, was taken to the
Holocaust in 1942 and —

and my grandmother as well.

not return. But I didn’t, of course I didn’t know it by sure. If you know what I mean.

December 21, 2012
Q: Did he say anything special to you, when you said goodbye?
A: He did not. Actually he did not and I actually was — I didn’t talk to him so open how I should
and how he could. And we were aware — I thought that actually he is holding back something to
me because I was at the age of 16 at that time and I think he was not of the opinion that I can
understand the whole thing and that I, he wanted probably to hold me out of it.
Q: Yes. So did you have any contact with him after he left?
A: No, I did not have. I only got two postcards and there, of course was nothing important
because this was everything censored and he couldn’t actually be open or, or tell me something.
Q: How long was he in Terezin?
A: Just a short time. I don’t know actually how long but I think not longer than a couple of
weeks.
Q: And then what happened?
A: Then he was transported to other areas and actually I don’t know where because I have more -
- when I investigated about that so I got more answers. So actually I don’t know for sure what
happened to him.
Q: So he did not survive?
A: No, no, no he did not survive.
Q: He did not survive. Ok. Yeah, so now you’re with your mother and it’s as you said 1942 and
you’re going to school. Did you talk about the war with your other friends? Or did you talk about
the Germans among the other boys?

Germans came in the school and took —

A: 1943. Did I say something else?
Q: You said 1933.
A: No, no, no, no. 1943.
Q: 1943 the Germans came to your school.
A: The Germans came to the school and took the most part of the class to Berlin for some forced
work. We were at that time in our class, a number of 39 people. From this 39 people were five
girls and the other ones were boys. Yes. And they took from the class 23 of us and we went to
Berlin for forced work. Forced work means we just were taken for help after the bombing and
actually they took the people who actually died by the bombing and took them into the, so there
couldn’t — for example, happened something with a mill or something like this when the
corpse would be a longer time in the bombed area.
Q: So you were 18 years old by this time.
A: No, no I was younger than that. I was 16.

Q: How long did you stay in Berlin?
A: Half a year.
Q: And then?

Q: You’re retired now?
A: Oh Iam retired very many years because I am very old man already.
Q: Do you think about the war often as you’ve gotten older?
A: Oh yes, I think about the time and especially in the last years I am very often thinking about
my father and about his time, what could happen after the war if my father would survive.
Q: You mean what he’d be doing, is that what you mean?
A: What, actually I, yes what, what he will be doing and actually I didn’t actually get very much
education of my father’s side because you know my father was out of my life in 1934, which I
was nine years old. So he had very few possibilities to educate myself and to think what he
thinking what I should be in my life if you understand what I mean.
Q: You have three sons?
A: Yes, I have three sons.
Q: When those sons were the age that you were when you were in the labor camp and in the
other camp, did it make you think of those times? When they were that same age that you were,
did it bring back memories of what you were doing when you were their age, the hard life that
you had in —
A: I don’t think that they are thinking about that because I, in my family I actually told very few

https://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Hans Ziegler 40
December 21, 2012
things about my former life, about the Holocaust and about the, about my experience in the camp
in Berlin and the camp in Postelberg. So and I don’t think that they were very — they know about
it, yes. But they didn’t question too much about that. You —
Q: But, yeah go on.
A: Two of the sons are medical doctors, and the third one — because my wife was a medical
doctor. And the third one is studying construction and is a construction engineer, a building
engineer. So actually they did very well. I’m very happy with my family and even with my sons
because they developed in very good and useful people and I am very happy about that.
Q: Are there any sights or sounds or smells or something that make you think of the war time
years when you were in Postelberg or in Berlin? Today, is there anything that reminds you of
that time?
A: Of course I — it does because about the time in Berlin I wrote a book. I wrote a book with a
friend of mine which spent the time in Berlin with me. So actually I had a lot possibilities to
think about the time and I even visited Berlin many years later to see about the areas and about
the places where I actually spent my time in Berlin.
Q: Tell me a little bit more about the book.
A: Well it’s actually a book which happens about the time when we were at the school and how
we were taken about the school and what we actually thought about the whole thing on the trip,
because nobody actually knew where he is going. We didn’t know that we were going to Berlin
to take care about the dead people and about the ruins there. And we were actually astonished
when we landed at Berlin, the capital of Germany and had to be there almost one half a year and
do the job. So this handles about the book and then it handles about actually the time when the
Germans came to occupy the Czech area. And then it handles about even about the time that the
Czech Republic changed to the communist republic. In both of these times were actually for us a
very hard time to survive this.

So actually it had, it had the book handles about the surviving both of these times, the German
time and then the communist.
Q: What is the name of your book?
A: The name of the book remembers a little bit of the Hemingway book because Hemingway
wrote a book about the lost generation. And we, our book actually got the name let me translate.
It’s the Then Lost Generation.
Q: Who was the other author?
A: The other author was named Fisher. Josef Fisher.
Q: Was he also half Jewish?
A: No, no he was Christian.
Q: Where, has the book been translated?
A: Because you remember, you remember it was since at the time we were taken from the school
because we were half Jewish.
Q: Has the book been translated?
A: No, never, no, no.
Q: It’s in the Czech language.
A: In the Czech language but the Czech language and sometimes some chapters are in English.
No in German so excuse me. Some chapters are in English because we reproduced some flyers
which were coming from the Americans and from the English from the planes down to Berlin.

Interview with Hans Ziegler 42
December 21, 2012
Q: So you say as you’ve gotten older you think more about your war time experiences?
A: Well I actually got older so I thought actually more at the time in Berlin because I tried to
forget the time in the camp with the Jewish people, the half Jewish people. It was something
which I didn’t like and what I actually wanted to get out of my mind.
Q: Do you have grandchildren?
A: Yes, I have two grandchildren.
Q: You don’t speak of the war years now with your children, with your sons anymore. Right?
A: Did I try to speak about that, so they tell me father, we don’t want to speak about that
because we already know everything. That you told. So —
Q: What are your thoughts about the United States? You said you had thought maybe you would
retire here but then obviously changed your mind.
A: Oh yes, actually what I wanted to do 1s retire and stay in the United States and what happens,
then there was a possibility to return to the Czech Republic, back to Czech Republic. So I
actually — and then I still thought that I will stay there because I thought that some of my sons
will come to me, to United States. And actually it would happen that one will stay in Czech
Republic, the other one in Germany and the third one the United States so I didn’t know what to
do. Yes, it was a little bit complicated.
Q: You still have a son in the United States?
A: No he then decided to go to Germany because there was some difficulties with, when he
studied at the university so they didn’t want to actually acknowledge that he studied in Germany,
the studies. And then ended in United States. There were some difficulties. So actually he said

he would lose two years and he didn’t want to lose the two years so he stayed in Germany. You
understand what I mean?
Q: Have you been back to the United States since you left?
A: Oh yes, several times.
Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington?
A: No, I have been to the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem.
Q: And what were your thoughts there?
A: Oh this is great. It’s just great. It’s something which I didn’t even expect to see because
actually a new one. When I went to Israel the first time in the 90s it wasn’t built yet. And
actually it is a pretty new museum. I was just astonished and I was very actually I was very glad
that I can see things which I actually wasn’t aware of. I was very impressed about that.
Q: Such as, what did you — you said you learned some things.
A: Yes, of course I learned some things and —
Q: Such as what?
A: Well mostly about how people care about the times and how, how they are able to reproduce
things which are actually where I thought were forgotten because nobody actually right after the
war, actually nobody talked about this time. There were other sort of people and people got,
actually tried to get their lives again and I think they hadn’t time to talk about this. And when I
saw it after all this time, this museum I was very impressed by the way, how it handles things.
And even there is another part of the museum which handles just children. And it is extremely

https://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Hans Ziegler 44
December 21, 2012
interesting, this part of the children you know. Because how well the children survived and how
they actually got through these times.
Q: Do you think the Holocaust could happen again?
A: No.
Q: Why not?
A: Yeah, because people are thinking in Germany all the people are, there is a part of the people
who are actually still having in mind the Nazi area. There are very few people and they do not
have any influence at the politics and I don’t think that, and the people since that time is now 50
or 55 years after the war. They just change in thinking and they are not any more racist I think.
Q: Is there anything you’d like to add to what you’ve said. Any thoughts that you have?
A: I think we almost covered everything I wanted to tell about this.
Q: Any other things.
A: Iam just happy that I could yes, there is something because the family of my cousin I told
you about the medical doctor in San Francisco. So actually when I spent my time in United
States all these ten years, I met this guy very often and we met even several times a year. Even
when we were I was in, actually in Ohio and he was in California.
So we met at least twice or three times a year and spent very much free times together. And this
family is a Jewish family. He married then a woman from Prague. She is Jewish and he adopted
actually her five children. And even with this family I was very close to this family and spent a
lot time with this family.
