September 12, 2012
Question: This a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr.
Gerald Liebenau, on September 12", 2012, here at the museum, in the Rubinstein
auditorium. Welcome Mr. Liebenau, and thank you for agreeing to speak with us.
Answer: Thank you.
Q: We’re going to begin the interview, like we always do, at the beginning. We’re
going to want to know a little bit about your early life, who your family was, and so
on. So I shout — I shoot out the first question. Where were you born, when were you
born? Tell me a little bit about your father, your mother, and any siblings you might
have had.
A: I was born in Berlin, in a place called Elssholzstrasse, which is located across a
park which has something to do with what happens eventually. I was born
November 30, 1925, and I lived in Berlin until 1938, when my family escaped from
Germany. My father was a — at that time was working in textiles. He was also born
in Berlin, as was his grandfather, and probably generations beyond that. And he
was in the army, and the World War I. He was a machine-gunner, and sp-spent four
years in — in the army. He survived without any injury, but he did suffer from
dysentery and almost died, but survived, obviously. He fought in both the eastern
part, that is in the Russian sector, as well as the western front. And he was a very

patriotic German, and was highly decorated the end of the war, for his
achievements.
Q: Do you remember some of the decorations that he got?
A: He — he — he earned the Iron Cross on the first and second class, and must have
done some outsta — he never talked about the war. The only thing I know about him
is from a military pass, which is a little booklet that soldiers have, in which all of
their battles are described. Every battle that’s the unit that he was in, participated in,
was identified. And I was able to put all this on a map one day, and I saw that he
indeed fought on all fronts. He was also — before he went into the war, he was a —
he — he — he — he — a window decorator. He was apprenticed at one of the large
Berlin department stores.
Q: Do you remember the name’?
A: Well, it was probably Tietz, or one of the - Hermann Tietz. And he was quite
good in his field. But after the war, when he finally was relieved, he decided he
would change his trade. And I’Il go into that later.
Q: Okay.
A: While he was in the army, he was stationed 1n an occupation force, in Estonia.
And in — in what was then Reval, now Tallinn, the capital of the ci — of the state.
And he was in uniform. And I only assume that the occupation, at least in that part

September 12, 2012
of the world, was quite peaceful. So’s he — no one seemed to mind that he was in
uniform. He went to Jewish services on Friday night, and at the end of the service,
an elderly man came up to him and invited him to come to dinner at his home,
which was [indecipherable] I guess, for Jewish soldiers, when they go to services.
There he met a young girl. He was born in 18 na — 1889, and my mother was born
eight — no, he was born — and my mother was born in 1898.
Q: That can get confusing.
A: That can be confusing, but it — it does turn out that way, he — he was obviously a
little bit older than she. But they apparently fell in love. And while I’ve never had
him talk about it, or my mother, they were — there were letters that I saw, that he’d
written. I should add that he was an avid letter writer. He eventually learned to type
with one finger, and was quite good at it. And everything he typed, he made a
carbon copy, so that I now have v-volumes of his letters, which describe almost
anything that ever happened to him. The war years are not there. The war years are
a f— World War I, that is, were not in any of his letters. But there was a postcard
which he had sent to his then sweetheart, in Tallinn, probably from Berlin, which
he bemoans the fact that he is all alone. And he drew a picture of an umbrella
standing and leaning against the fence of the house that apparently they lived in.
And he is as lonely as the umbrella.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Q: How could that not melt somebody’s heart, you know?
A: Exactly. My mother was studying piano. She was — first studied in Tallinn, and
then went to Saint Petersburg. And when the revolution began —
Q: You’re talking about the Russian revolution?
A: Russian revolution began, the - my mo — my grandmother insist that she come
home, and she did. And then — and this becomes til — mysterious, she ended up
going to Berlin. She said she went there to study, and then she explained how one
day he was — she was walking on Potsdamer Platz, which is sort of the equivalent
of Times Square, and happened to bump into my father. That, obviously, is a
made-up story, but that’s as far as I could get from her. They were married, and in —
Q: What was your mother’s maiden name’?
A: Her name was Organitsky(ph).
Q: And what was her first name?
A: Well, she was — Helene was her first name. She was also known as Lola. My
father’s explanation was that he had so many girlfriends, he gave them all the same
name, so Lola was the name that he picked for her as well, and she became known
as Lola throughout her life. They had a very happy marriage.
Q: Were you the oldest child?
A: I was the first-born, yes. My sister is five years younger, and when she was —

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Q: What is her name?
A: — when she was born, we moved from our first domain, to another section of
Schreuderburg(ph). That’s where I grew up, at least until —
Q: You grew up in the center of Berlin, almost.
A: It was not far from Kofsterdam(ph). Bayerischer Platz is — there — there were
no Jewish districts of Berlin, but there were places where there may be more Jews
than not. There was a — a Jewish textile section in Berlin, which was quite active,
and that’s where my father ended up. He decided that being a window trimmer is
not a job that a man, when he gets older, can perform, because he’s standing in a
window all day long. And it’s — it’s very hard on the body, and it’s hot in the
summer and cold in the winter, and that’s not something he wanted to do for the rest
of his life. Ironically, that’s exactly what he did to the rest of his life. But that was
after he came to the United States. While in Germany, he was attracted to the
textile business because his brother-in-law, my — his sister’s husband —
Q: From the Liebenau side.
A: On the Liebenau side. His name was Hersheft(ph), now known as Hartley(ph).
They were well-off. I mean, they — they were considered to be the wealthy part of
the family, and my father was able to apprentice, or get a job with his brother-in-
law, and eventually open up his own store. He had the textiles.

Q: Oh, your father had a textile store?
A: Textile store which he imported the textiles from London, or England, and
Czechoslovakia, which is also something that was important.
Q: Would this have been tex — all kinds of textiles, both for furniture, and
furnishings, as well as for clothing, or would of —
A: I—I believe it was clothing. I— I’m not sure about that, but I think it was
clothing, that’s what seemed to be the more main thing.
Q: Can you tell me — well, I have two questions. One of them you anticipated and
answered in some way, which was o — what you knew of your father’s war years,
and of his family life, had he told you stories, and you say no, he never talked of it.
And yet, you seem to know quite a bit about — about what his early years were like.
How did you find out?
A: Well, these are, at best side remarks he might have made. Some of his letters, of
course, do give me some insight in what happened. But there was never any session
with him where I would sit down and say, now tell me about the war years, even
after I became a soldier myself. He would tell me little bits and pieces about his
experience, which I guess was meant to teach me how to be — how to take care of
myself. It so happened I also became a heavy machine-gunner, which was in the
family, I guess.

Q: But it completely by coincidence, huh?
A: Completely by coincidence, yes. I can talk about that later on —
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: — but that’s — but my — so my family consisted of my mother’s family in
Estonia, which was her two brothers. One of them was a doctor, the other was an
engineer. And my grandfather was in the hops, and what’s beer made of?
Q: Brewery? Brewery? Ah, yeah, hops. So he was a brewer?
A: Yeah — no, he was not a brewer, he was importing just the —
Q: The grain?
A: — the grain, yes, so — so that was just his job. That’s what I understand. He must
have done well, because th — we visited him about three or four times.
Q: Do you have memories of being there?
A: Oh yes, I have pictures of his dacha(ph), which was quite large, and — and — and
— and looked very prosperous. He used to — he — he had that in — in a seas — seaside
resort, called Novai(ph) Aizel(ph), which had a lovely beach, and was right on the
Baltic, and we spent a lot of time swimming there. That was one of the pleasant
remembries | have of his being —

Interview with Gerald Liebenau

A: In her family, German and Russian were the language. She does speak Estonian,
but I doubt very much — I think she once said that’s only spoken by the maids, but
that’s a very nasty comment to make. But —
Q: Well, it’s also — y-you know, the — tha-that — that was the social structure at the
time.
A: It was the social structure and German was the, you know, the — the language of
the cultured, and ed-educated. Russian was also considered a major language. So
she was fluent in Russian and German and I noticed also she spoke French at one
point. She had a musical ear, and languages just flowed into her. The moment she
stepped foot on the United States, she spoke English.
Q: That’s amazing. There — there are people who have that —
A: And my father has totally opposite, no — which is the same, my — my problem.
Q: Yeah?
A: My — my language abilities are very limited. I don’t learn languages easily.
Q: But at home in Berlin, German was how you spoke, yes?
A: Germ — only German, yes.
Q: Only German.
A: There was no other language spoken at home.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Q: Yeah. I wanted to step back a minute, and ask two questions. One, which is, do
you have any earliest memories from your childhood, that you can recall?
A: Well, I— I was a fairly pampered child. I — my — my parents took good care of
me. I remember my first day in school, I had one of those cornucopias.
Q: You mean, like a real basket of cornucopia?
A: It was a large paper — sort of a large ice cream cone, stuffed with toys, and meant
to — a-and s — and candy, where candy was the prime factor in that baggage, to
sweeten school, your school year.
Q: Well, the currency of children.
A: Yes.
Q: If cigarettes are the currency of soldiers, then candy is the currency of kids.
A: Exactly, and it worked.
Q: Yeah.
A: My school years were very happy. I began school in a public school, which was
just a block down from where we lived. A long block, but it was walkable, and I
walked every day to school. My teacher was a very kind man, even though his name
was Zorn, which also is the name of a red skinned coach that we had at one time.
But Zorn was not angry, which is what zorn means, he was a very kind person. I
never had the feeling as I was any different from anyone else. My — my integration

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
—I played with whoever was willing to play cowboys and Indians, which was the
main game of the time, and it was inspired by a man named Karl May, who wrote
volumes and volumes about the Indians and cowboys in America, and I heard that
he never was in the United States, but he described it so beautifully, that 1t must
have been only he, that he thought what he saw was authentic.
Q: Well, Karl May exists to this day in — in — when I went to school in Germany,
people would tell me about this great writer of Indian stories, who, as an American,
I had never heard.
A: No, I— every — every child was — was reading that.
Q: Excuse us — excuse us for a second. [technical interruption] Before we go into
school, I wanted to dwell a little bit more about your family. Not only your
mother’s and father’s background, but tell me a little bit about what their
personalities were like. Who did you feel closer to, if you did, and what did they —
what were they like at home’?
A: My — my father was a typical German businessman. I mean, he would come
home, and there would be dinner on the table. And my mother was a typical
German housewife. Her interests were in playing piano. We always had a piano,
and she was always practicing. I can remember those practice sessions seemed to be

forever, and the same things were played over and over again, and she made the
same mistake every time she practiced. It was a —
Q: What is a typical German businessman of the time?
A: I'm sor —
Q: Who wa — what is a typical German businessman of the time?
A: Well, it — it — a businessman went into the home, he never talked about his
business, but his schedule was very routine, and when he went to work, his mode of
transportation was a motorcycle with a sidecar. And the sidecar had the two
compartments, and we all fit into that; my mother, my sister, I was in back of my
father. And I even have a picture of the maid being in there somewhere. But we did
have maids. There was a maid who took care of the house, so that my mother really
had a lot of time to herself, and she had — she visited with people of her own age,
her — her — her people with whom she had relations for many, many years.
Q: She was a shi — sociable person?
A: She was very sociable, she was a very sociable, outgoing person, and my father
was very supportive. I have pictures of them going to masked balls, and occasions
where obviously social life was number one. And she was always [indecipherable].
She was a very lovely, beautiful woman, and she had a lot of talents. And so she
was, you know, eas — easy to live with.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Q: Were they both approachable?
A: Yes, my mother was. My father was also, although there was never much
intimacy, there was enough connection so that you never felt that you were alone
[indecipherable], they — they were very close to their children. They did go out by
themselves [indecipherable] they — they went skiing in Czechoslovakia. And we
did take trips to — all of us together took trips to Estonia. And —
Q: And your sister — were you and your sister close, or were — because she was a
girl and you were a boy, and there were so many years, that your worlds were —
A: I must confess that my — my — unto this day, we have a nice relationship. I mean,
she lives in Connecticut, and we telephone each other every week, and we speak,
and this — but we — we — we are different in — in many ways. She has lived in the
same place all her life, and I was all over the world. She — she’s married to an
optometrist, and she live — they live in a very small town, you know, that’s — all her
life. My mother, of course, was unhappy with that, because she felt someone should
live in a big city, and should participate in all the — all the cultural offerings that
were there. So, in ways, we were different. We — we did travel a little bit to — to — I
think we were once in Denmark, on seaside. And — but otherwise my — my
family’s weekend activity was in the Jewish rowing club.
Q: Tell us a little bit about that. What was the Jewish rowing club?

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
A: The Jewish rowing club was founded in 1905, and it consisted of approximately
between 50 and 70 people. I have a little history of the club, which I just skimmed
over again. And it was very active. They had a number of rowing boats, which were
used for regattas. My father was very active in this, and he was a very skilled sculls
— scull man. He had his own boat, a double boat, that is for two people, for my
mother was also rowing with him. And I, on many occasions was the coxswain,
even though I was just a little kid, I kept a seat there, and acted like I was steering
the boat. We loved being near the water, I mean that was our social life. The place
itself was not a lot —
Q: Is this — on what — what body of water was this within Berlin? Was it the river
Spree?
A: Yes, it was on the Spree.
Q: Okay.
A: And the club was called Oberspree.
Q: Oberspree.
A: Which meant the — the upper end of the Spree, but it was one of several Jewish
clubs. There were maybe a half a dozen of them, and they competed with one
another, and big deals were made when they win, and they would [indecipherable]

when they lost. The men were mostly engaged in the sport. The women spend most
of their time drinking coffee, and talking about whatever women talk about.
Q: To this day, that’s a mystery to men.
A: Yes, it is. But we were all busy. And it was very social. People grew very close
to each other. This was — these were the people with whom they socialized, these
are the people whom they celebrated any big events. And it was always open to
them. The weekend —
Q: So did you have your friends there too, in —
A: I developed my own friends, I had — my girlfriends were there, I mean, I was
then 12 years old, 11 — 10, 11. I started going when I was probably five, or six, but
eventually I became more conscious of what it — what it was like. That’s where I
learned to swim, and to this day I believe that I have avoided major diseases
because I was —
Q: Inoculated?
A: — inoculated in — in the Spree.
Q: Which is not the cleanest river.
A: It—if it isn’t now, you should have seen it then. Siemens had a big plant across
the river, right on the other side, and I’m sure when they spilt chemicals, they were
not too careful as to where it went. And so I must have been exposed to everything

that could possibly be given to a youngster. So I had a very healthy life in many
ways, and I attribute some of that to the fact that I had the Spree water to inoculate
me.
Q: Yeah. Well, it sounds like a very happy childhood.
A: It was a happy childhood, the Jewish community in Berlin was large. It was very
self-confident. People felt that they were as much part of the culture and population
of the city as anyone else. There was never any sign of anti-Semitism.
Q: Can I interrupt just for a second, however? You say self-confident, but it also
sounds self-contained, in that I don’t hear that there would be much interaction with
people who were non-Jews.
A: I think they did have quite a close social — I mean, my — my parents, if I speak
only for them, had mostly Jewish friends. My father was never a member of any
army organizations of any sort. He was — he was — he was v — a very patriotic man.
I mean, when the war came, Jews just went for the — for the — the recruiting offices
to — to participate in this disaster.
Q: You’re talking about World War I.
A: World War I, yes.
Q: Yeah. So did you have any interaction with kids who were not Jewish?

then things began to change, and it was quite clear — and there were several ways I
know now that there were changes. Fo —
Q: Well, let’s go — I’m sorry, I’m interrupting again, but —
A: Yeah.
Q: — Id like to get the sense from you, as through a child’s eyes, how you perceived
them, and, you know, what one learns afterwards, can put it into context. But how
did you experience those larger political changes, 1n your own life?
A: Well, first of all, I was not aware they were really political.
Q: Okay.
A: There — there were changes which were so different that I remember them
clearly.
Q: Okay.
A: The first one was in the park. We were playing cowboys and Indians, as we
usually did, and again, it was a big scud — I don’t think it was a jew — they never
talked about these things. We didn’t talk about religion, they didn’t talk about
religion, we didn’t. I didn’t have much to talk about, I was not from that kind of a

religious home where my Judaism was that obvious, or that much practiced. But we
did —
Q: So your family was not religious, really.
A: Not in the sense that they would be kosher, or have any other — but they
attended, certainly, all the holidays. They went to synagogue, they were members of
a synagogue. I went to a Jewish school, to a— to a religious school where — as I
would have here.
Q: Okay.
A: And so it was not that we were outside of the religion, we were just not very
active in the religion. But we were playing in this park, and all of a sudden there
was a crowd of people who gathered in front of a very large courthouse. On both
sides of the steps were Gestapo, or actually, I guess they were Gestapo, but they
were dressed as Hitler — Hitler Stormtroopers.
Q: Do you remember their uniforms, what they looked like?
A: They were — yes, they were brown uniforms, with black pants, and a leather strap
across. The leather strap was used whenever there was a fight, they’d take them off
and just whip people with them. So it was not just a costume, it was a weapon of
sorts. They stood on both sides of this entryway, which was rather large. And out
came a — a group of men, all dressed in black, carrying attaché cases. And there was

a lot of booing. Many people had come to the scene by this time. There was a lot of
noise being made, shouts. And there was also many people yelling heil Hitler. So
something was going on which was not pleasant. I did not know, as a child, what
exactly this was. I also began to see now, that the newspapers had turned their
attention to Jews. The Stormtroopers had their own publication called “Der
Stiirmer,’ which means Stormtrooper, this was their maga — which was
everywhere, it was so widely publicized. I think they practically gave it away. But
every —
Q: Was it on those th — I don’t know what they’ re called, but in Berlin they’re these
sort of like cylindrical —
A: Advertising columns, yes.
Q: Right.
A: But that was the only one. Every corner had a newspaper stand —
Q: I see.
A: — and the newspapers were open so people could see what’s there. And I began
to see these things which I recognized as anti-Semitic.
Q: Did you a— ask your parents about it, what does this mean, what’s going on?
A: Well, it was discussed at home, but not to the point where I was being instructed
what this is about. I mean, this — these are all personal feelings I had. First of all,

they displayed Jews as non-humans. I mean, they had faces that no human would
have, and hands and hair and noses, and — ah, caricatures that were obviously highly
offensive. And as a kid, it was offensive to me as well. I also began to notice that in
one of the side streets, the corner where we lived — I lived in a block, in a — in five,
six story building, which was part of a block, the whole street was the same
buildings.
Q: Is this Elssholzstrasse?
A: Elssholz —
Q: Yeah, Elssholz, yeah.
A: Elssholzstrasse, yes. And e-every — when we finally moved to another section
of Berlin, the Haberland Strasse, it was the same type of — we lived on the fourth
floor, there were no elevators, and I learned to walk steps early in life. Fights began
to break out between young men, almost boys, dressed in their Hitler youth outfits,
which were similar to the others. And red shirted young men on the other side.
Obviously the communists and the Nazis were girding up for a struggle. And it was
a —a pretty wild scene, that I, as a child remember very distinct —
Q: Were you scared?
A: I was scared enough not to go near them, but on the other hand, there was a
certain amount of jealousy. Here was this cult of young boys, they were always

marching and singing, and it was something I obviously couldn’t join. That became
clear to me also, that I was not wanted in that crowd.
Q: How did it become clear?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: How did this become clear? Was there an incident, or was it just you just knew’?
A: I must have felt it. If my parents were concerned about this, they did not
demonstrate it to me. I mean, I — I think they made a real effort not to let our home
become infected by the lo — the hatred outside.
Q: Did you sense though, that they themselves were more — or that they were less
easygoing than earlier, or were they sadder, or more serious at home? Or you didn’t
sense these things?
A: Not yet, not yet.
Q: Okay.
A: Eventually, this will happen, yes, but while we were still living in
Elssholzstrasse, this was still only a public school. Nothing happened in the school
that I remember as being addressed to me. It was still a— a place I enjoyed going to.
Q: So this would be the early 1930s?
A: This was between 19 — to 1936, 1933 to 1936, something like that.
Q: Okay, Hitler is already in power.

good indication of what really happened to me, now that I look at it back out, it was

but I was a good student. I behaved well, my grades were two and fi— wa — one
being the best, and five the worst, I was between two and three.
Q: So that would be a B grade, something —
A: AB grade student. And the comments of the teachers began to make some
interesting observations. By 1933 — by — by 1936, our — Jews were no longer
allowed — Jewish children no longer allowed to go to public school, and we came to
a Jewish school, which was not at all a pleasant experience. The whole thing was
strange, and I was not much at ease. My report cards also reflected the decline in
my attention span, in my — my behavior was okay, but there was enough to be said,
in each of those subsequent comments by teachers, that —

they would say?
A: I have them at home, I have the report cards, and comments by the teachers. And
while nothing was terribly bad, it was beginning to look negative, as to my behavior
and attention.
Q: Okay. Now, do you think that might have been because the teachers were being
— becoming more biased, or because your behavior was really that way?
A: No, it was a lot of tension at home. Tension began to build up.
Q: Okay.
A: Eventually we moved to Haberland Strasse, which was a — a more comfortable
apartment, was a little bigger. It had a —
Q: How many rooms?
A: Ther — I would say about three. The maid had hers, and I had mine, my sister had
a room. I guess three or four bedrooms.
Q: Mm-hm. That’s pretty large.
A: And again, the piano was the center of the — of the room. My new school was not
a happy place for me, and I—I can only attribute to the fact that I was — I was
beginning to get obviously more tense about what was happening at home. My

father started learning English. Why, I’m not sure, but I guess he felt there was a
possibility we may get — have to get out of Germany.
Q: Did his business change after 1933? If he owned a textiles —
A: I’m not aware of that.
Q: Okay.
A: No, he was — he was active in business, almost to the end.
Q: Okay.
A: And I’m not aware that there was much that changed. My mother, and her
girlfriends began talking about jobs which one could do overseas, away from
Germany. And they were usually either in the maids, or couples, man and wife
would go work for some [indecipherable] family, and he would do the yardwork,
and she would do the home cleaning. They did not have any very ambitious future
for themselves. They — they — they knew they wouldn’t speak the language, and th-
they were more left preparing for fairly low skill kind of job. And this — this seems
peculiar to me now; it wasn’t then. There was tension in the family. My father was
an avid listener to the — to the radio, and he picked up BBC, which was a very
dangerous thing to do, because if he got caught, he would certainly be arrested
immediately. But he managed to put his ear next to the ra-radio, and then listen to
the news, so was fairly well-informed.

September 12, 2012
Q: Did your mother not like that?
A: My mother was not that much involved. She — first of all, she seemed to know
English anyhow, from where I don’t know, but she must have learned it somewhere.
But there was more. My father was an avid stamp collector. And like his decorating
skills, his skills with stamps was remarkable. Every single stamp was specially
protected against any possible damage. His albums were the neatest and best
looking, and he was very careful to buy good stamps. He had a very good — a
valuable collection of stamps. That was his hobby, stamps was his hobby. Rowing
was his sport, and the motorcycle, I guess was part of his sport, because he — we did
go out with the cycle very often. I was not at all a sports-type person. I participated
reluctantly in any sport that I had to participate in. I was good in nothing. I—I-—I
must say, to this day, sports are not high on my list, either as an active sportsman, or
as anything else.
Q: But did you like the rowing?
A: I liked rowing, yes, a matter of fact, when I was in college, I did at one point try
that, but I could see that was — was not my talent. I was just not an — I — I was more
of the studious type, and learning took a lot of work for me, and I did spend much
time just doing my work, my homework.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Q: It sounds like the tension was internalized, without you even realizing it, when
you were, you know, during these school years. Or, is it that you did realize it?
A: I— Thad the tension — yes, I clearly did realize. I mean, there were — there were
certain things said and done at home, which — which did bother me.
Q: Can you tell us what they were?
A: Well, there were discussions about how to get out, and how to find somebody to
provide us the help that we needed. And this leads to, you know, at a certain point,
and — and it was so late in deciding that something had to be done, that it’s almost
miraculous that something did get — come out of this. The first thing they did was
try to find somebody who could provide us with affidavit to go somewhere. And my
mother, somehow became a ter — different person, all of a sudden. She turned from
a social, very light, butterfly-type person, into a real tiger. She remembered that her
father said at one point that he had a brother who had emigrated to the United
States, and he not only knew that, he also knew his name, which no longer was
Organitsky(ph), but now became Miller. And he knew where he was located. So
my mother started writing letters to her — to her uncle, and there was a lot of
communications with her father, as well, because —
Q: Well, he was in Estonia.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
A: He was in Estonia, and — and it was always about, you know, can you help us
here, and can you help us there. And the father was, you know, was — certainly was
willing, but I don’t think he had many resources to turn to, except for this brother,
which was remarkable. There was also our good fort — now, this began in 1937 -
1938, I mean —
Q: That’s pretty late.
A: — that’s pretty late. It was also very fortunate that his son David —
Q: Uh-huh. His uncle’s son.
A: His — my uncle — her uncle’s son, yes, was — just graduated from law school.
And he was obviously the person to whom they turn when question of affidavits
came up. He was willing to give us an affidavit. He wrote the affidavit skillfully, as
a lawyer can be expected, and we thought we had what we needed to get out of
Germany.
Q: So they would have been your sponsors, in other words, in the United States.
A: I’m sorry?
Q: They would have been your sponsors, your uncle would have been the sponsor.
A: He would have been the sponsor, he would — the affidavit was for the purpose of
di — of swearing to the U.S. government that these people will never become a ward
of the state.

Q: Yeah.
A: Which I became for the rest of my life.
Q: We'll get to that, we’ll get to that.
A: But 1-1-1t — it was a big commitment to make, and it was very difficult to get
anyone to do that. And we were very fortunate that not only was he able, willing,
but he had a man who could write an affidavit skillfully. But it was to no use at all.
They took the affidavit to the American embassy, and here I must say a word about
the foreign service —
Q: Yes.
A: — of the United States, which was highly anti-Semitic. I mean, they really didn’t
want Jews to come to the United States.
Q: This was the embassy in Berlin.
A: The embassy in Berlin, but this was also true in Washington, that the whole
idea of rescuing Jews never come up. They turned down the affidavit, because
Uncle Miller — Uncle Morris(ph) did not have enough money. He owned a second-
hand clothing store on Lackawanna Avenue in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which is
merely the dumps. And I to this day remember the smell of that place, and why
anybody would even go to buy something there is itself a question. But he made
enough money to send his son to college, but it was certainly not enough for the

[indecipherable] foreign service officer who was looking this over, and say, that’s
not good enough.
Q: Can I stop, just for a second? Did your mother — I mean, can you des — were you
there, did you go to the embassy, did she go by herself, did your father go? Do you
have any — any details from how — what kind of experience they had?
A: I know this was a very tedious experience. I imagine my mother must have gone
at some time, because my father was still working.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and the lines to the embassies were long, and the time they gave you was
short. So that I could only imagine that my mother must have done a good bit of the
standing in line and — and talking. And she was a wonderful talker. I mean, she
could persuade anyone of anything that she needed done. So she should have been
successful, but this was not — not here. Anyhow, a letter went back to my Uncle
Morris(ph), and told him this was not good enough. But he was obviously not
satisfied with that, and he found himself a — another man. There were several other
correspondences that went on here that led eventually to Morris(ph) going to a man
with whom he emigrated from Estonia, and who was a much more — a much
wealthy man. He owned movie theaters, these little movie theaters they had in those
days, for 20 cents, or 10 cents you can get in. And — but he had a number of them,

and obviously had a lot of money, and he wrote an affidavit, or David wrote it for
him. And this time they went to this [indecipherable] Berlin embassy, and they
rejected it because the man was not a blood relative.
Q: This is the U.S. embassy in Berlin.
A: The U.S. embassy in Berlin was — felt that this was no good because that was —
was a blood relative. At this point my father became almost panicky. It was his
belief that the most dangerous — the greatest danger was for Jewish men; that they
were not after the women, or after the children, they were only after the men. And
he wrote one of his letters to one of his friends that he — would you like me to read
from that —
Q: Yes, I’d like, very much. And at the same time, let’s not forget, I’d like to hear a
little bit more about the Jewish communities, not just one, in Berlin. I believe you
have a book that shows just how many there were. So I’d like to show that, but let’s
read the letter first. Okay. I think it’s in the other side, the — the glasses.
A: One of his major correspondents was a man by the name of Martin
Schwartz(ph), who emigrated to Mexico City. He was a very close friend, an-and
to my father confided him in his feelings, and how he was doing as a refugee. He
decided to escape.
Q: So this is the letter he’s written before he becomes a refugee?

A: Yes. No, this after. After he became. He decided that he had to get out, and he
was willing to try to cross the border legally. But it turned out the borders by this
time, were so closely guarded, that this was impossible. So he applied at the British
embassy for a visa — a business visa. That is to go — to put in for a short period of
time, and that he would be expected to return to Berlin. I-I — that was an instinct he
had to wait for this visa to come to him. It was — he ha — in addition to the visa,
there had to be an exit permit of some sort, given by the German government, and
that was not forthcoming. So that the period of time in his visa, which was about
five weeks, was quickly running short. And it was just almost in the last moment
that the permission to leave Germany was given to him.
Q: How nerve-wracking.
A: And li — di— by the way, the Nazis in the beginning were not objecting to
German Jews leaving, and — but there was no country they could go to, it was
almost impossible. So when he got to London, in September 1938, he wrote to se —
letter to Martin Schwartz(ph). “I arrived here yesterday. I probably don’t have to
describe to you the struggle I have endured. First was the decision to leave my
family, four days before the high holidays, and then to have to celebrate them here.
The situation for the Jews in Germany have reached the point where every Jewish
male was in danger for his life. They are picked up directly in the streets to fill the

concentration camps, where entire military installations, factories and centers are
being constructed underground. There are also non-Jews in these places, but their
condition and food cannot be compared to those of the Jews. They lived in separate
camps.” He knew a great deal.
Q: But you — but he didn’t pass it on to you at home.
A: Well —
Q: And — and it — in such detail.
A: This — thi — no, he would not write that home because the mail — there was a
chance the mail was being watched.
Q: No, what I mean to say — I— I meant to express it this way, that he didn’t — this
knowledge that he had, he did not talk about it with you at home, in an effort to
protect you. That’s what I’m getting this —
A: No.
Q: No?
A: My mother, of course, was part of this. I mean, he — he had no secrets from her,
and — and she was full aw — fully aware of the danger he thought he was in. And the
interesting part is that he thought it was only men, and that that’s why he moved to
escape, because he felt that once he was in England, he could get his family to

follow him. And, as he said in the same letter, he said, if I had stayed and — and got
picked up, then I would be of no help to my family at all.
Q: Well, had you heard then, in your family, of acquaintances, or people that you
knew, who were arrested all of a sudden on the street, like he mentions in this
letter? Had that been something that was common knowledge in discussion?
A: Apparently it was. I mean, by this time Jews became very much aware of what
was going on, because people were disappearing, and interestingly, they knew
where they were going, and they had some idea that these people will never come
back. That’s what my father wrote in his letter.
Q: Right, yeah.
A: And so it was not a mystery as to what was happening, they knew. And —
Q: My question 1s a little bit more precise, it is, do you remember hearing about
such things?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: No, I did not hear any of it. It was not until Kristallnacht that I became aware of
what was going on, really.

Q: That, and we never finished finding out who were these men who were with the

A: Oh, they were the Jewish lawyers.

Q: Okay.

Q: And then — so let’s jump forward again, and you talk about Kristallnacht. Tell
us about how Kristallnacht happened in your life.
A: I was going to school, I was walking. There were all within walking distance, I
walked to school. At the corner of the street where I lived, there was a very large art
supply shop. Now, I was always interested in art, a-and drawing, an-and — and
pictures and things of that sort. And I stopped at that window almost every day I
went to school or came home, looking for anything that — new that might have
appeared, any implement for artists. And while most of this was well beyond my
cap-capability, it was interesting for me to do that. But one day I came by, and the

Q: Jude.
A: Juden.

A: And everything in the window was stole, there was nothing left. And that was —

some — some very dangerous things were happening.
Q: Did you feel like you were in danger at that point, by that point?
A: Not personally, no.
Q: And your family, did they — did — you know, was your father still there?
A: My family — I can’t say my fam — my family obviously knew what was going on.
Q: Yeah.
A: I mean, my father was an astute listener to the news, and my mother was bright
enough to know what was going on, yes, I would say they do. And — but I — I’ve
never talked to them about that.

A: Yes.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
A: I was al — and my — again, my mother became a totally different woman, she
took charge.
Q: Yeah.
A: Before my father left, he did two things. He bought tickets for a sh — a sea
voyage to New York, on the Cunard lines, which left, that time, Hamburg. And
he had these tickets, I guess, or had them — at least bought and had some kind of
receipt for them. Cause when he was in London, he sent a letter to Cunard, saying,
I bought these in Berlin, can I use them in London as well? And I guess, yes, they
could. And so he had tickets. He also hired a furniture moving company to take our
furniture and sell it to Scranton, Pennsylvania. And whereas every other home was
immediately ransacked by whoever was the Gestapo that time, when we were about
to leave, my mother then was in charge, she couldn’t take any money with her, or
any jewelry, but she bought watches for all of us, so we were walking around with
watches. But otherwise, there was no money at all. And lo and behold, this huge
truck pulls up in front of our house with a lift van, these huge boxes that they put
furniture in, took our furniture and six months later when we came to Scranton,
there is was. The — they called us up, says pick it up in the port of New York. I
mean, it was — it was — I can only attest that to German bureaucracy, that once it
gets going, it just doesn’t stop, I mean —

Interview with Gerald Liebenau

Q: Yeah.
A: This was paid for, he had receipt, and they’re supposed to go get it, and that’s
what they did. They were not part of the Gestapo, obviously, and if the Gestapo
were there, they probably would have immediately interceded and stopped them.
We eventually were sorry that all that furniture came, because we had no place to
put that furniture. But that’s another story.
Q: I want to ask a few thing — now, that means then, that those first denials by the
U.S. embassy in Berlin were reversed, that eventually you did get permission to go
to the US.
A: Not — I’m not there yet.
Q: Okay. All right. All right, so —
A: Can we talk about the Berlin Jewish community?
Q: Yes, let’s do that.
A: I should have started that earlier, but 1t — it’s — it’s important to note how well
established, how confident, and how open they were, as a Jewish community. I have
a book here.
Q: Mm-hm, let’s take a look at it.

A: It’s called “Judisches Adressbuch fur Gross-Berlin, Ausgabe 1931.” 1931
they published this address book, which contains the name of every Jewish
household in Berlin.
Q: That’s huge.
A: Now, there were about 160,000 Jews in Berlin. I don’t know whether this 1s
160,000, or what that number is. But it lists every Jewish name, every Jewish
household, and a street address, and had an introduction, which is quite voluminous,
to explain the position on all of the Jewish community in Berlin, and some of the
people who were exceptionally well-known, including Albert Einstein.
Q: Yeah. Do you think his address is in there?
A: Well, I wouldn’t be surprised if it were in there.
Q: It’s a hu — that’s a very thick book for just a Jewish com — 1s it the only time that
such a book was put together, or was it part of a regular printing?
A: No, it was the only — no, this apparently is something that — that was designed to
let the ge — Nazi government know that the Jewish community in Berlin was sub —
sa — was substantial, it was well-endowed, and that it was — historically been there
forever.

A: They were anticipating what might come. They felt it was still a time where they
could influence the new government, if it were to come, of where the Jewish
community was. And all I could think of was that this must have been very helpful
to the Gestapo, because it was now easy to find every Jew in Berlin.
Q: How iron — how sadly ironic.
A: And they needed to go no further than this book, until pub — published in many
copies.
Q: Can I take a look at that? Thank you very much. Can we focus on this a little?

community. Just to let you know how much they were involved, the Germans had a
collection of — the people would be standing on corners with boxes, and — to collect
money for helping the poor in the winter. It’s called Winterhilfe.
Q: Okay.
A: In other words, they collected money and then would take care of people who
had no shelter, or food. The rowing club, Oberspree, was also a part of the
organizations that would help in this effort. But at one point, after the Nazis came
into power, and the Nuremberg laws came into effect, the club was no longer
allowed to participate in this effort, and it was obviously hurtful to them, that they
were all sad and left out of such an important —
Q: Altruistic kind of charity event.
A: — mission —
Q: Yeah.
A: — to help the poor. That’s how integrated they were. That’s how much they felt
they were part of the body politics on — and of the society as a whole. They even

of unbelievable —

you’ve seen — was your father, by the way, ever in danger himself? Did — was there

trouble finding him.

could not leave Berlin, he just had no way to — well, there was a lot of

married to a German, and also could not — had — had nowhere to go except to her

Q: In Estonia’?
A: In Estonia. She made the mistake of leaving her father’s home, to go back to ger

to Estonia, the train stopped, the people are taken off and shot, in along the woods

Q: — circumstances, whereas your — your close uncle, who was your father’s
brother, did not, even though his children were in Kindertransport.
A: Well, the Kindertransport occurred, I believe — I’m not sure — before they went
into the camps, yes —
Q: I see, yeah.
A: — I think they — the parents took the children to the trains, I think that’s how it
worked, and then, eventually they were picked up, too.

A: No, I believe it was after. I’m — I’m not sure what the dates are, but I— I have a
feeling it was after we left.
Q: Okay, so I go back to where I started, which was the — the movers are — have
come up to your house, the furniture is taken, your mother has — your mother is
there, she’s in charge. What does she do? How does — what happens?
A: Well, my mother became very resourceful at this point. She went to the British
embassy, and only my mother could do it, she talked them into giving her a visa to
visit her fa — her husband and to spend time with him until he has to return to
Germany. And he — she was given such a visa. So we had a visa for us, and we all
— now — now we are about to leave Germany. We got on a train, and there was a lot
of fear. I mean, I could tell this was not something that was going to be a pleasant
voyage. And sure enough, when we got to the Dutch border, our train was stopped,
all passengers were ordered to leave the train, and my mother at that time, just lost it
all. And I became the — the man of the house, I’m not sure —
Q: That’s means she — she just couldn’t — she just fell apart?
A: She — she fell — she — well, she didn’t fall apart, but she — but she was very
shocked by all this. Cause she — by — to — to her mind this was the end. We were
taken to a hotel, we all slept in the same bed. Was a decent hotel. And my mother
just never, you know, tha — at that point I had to tell my mother whatever I could

tell her, make her feel better. Next morning we were told to come back to the
station, and the train continued, and we left.
Q: So the — what — the amount of tension, the amount of nerve —
A: The tension was horrible.
Q: Yeah.
A: My father, in London, in the same letter I just read, explained how he was —
waited for the train to come, on which she was scheduled to arrive from London.
For two hours he waited and no train came. He said he was just devastated. But then
he re — received a cable from Holland. My mother thinks of these things, I mean
this is just amazing. She had the — the — she — she obviously gained back her — her
self-confidence, and she — she knew what she was doing, she sent him a cable,
saying I’m in London — I’m — I’m in Holland, I’m coming home — see you. So he
went back to the station. All was well.
Q: What happened to his stamp collection? You mentioned his stamp collection.
A: ’'m-—I’m glad you asked that, because that’s — that’s a chapter of my father’s
doing — I’m not sure, it’s a certain amount of ingenuity, and clandestinity(ph).
What he did, h-he invented a — a concealment device. He had another member of
the club, again, many of these connections were through the rowing club, who
manufactured albums. And the albums are usually a fairly thick covers, filled with

some kind of cotton, or material to make them soft. And what my father said, take
all that stuff out of the covers, so you leave a — an empty space, and then put my
stamps in there. He had a number of those made by him, and they all looked like
photo albums, but no pictures in them. I don’t know whether he took pictures in
them or not. But he sent them out as photo albums. Martin Schwartz(ph) got
several of them. And I am not sure whether he sent any to London. But that was his
way of at least bringing his colle — as much of his collection as possible out of
Germany, because there was no other way it would have come out.
Q: Amazing, amazing.
A: I’m sorry?
Q: Amazing. Amazing that he was — succeeded 1n it — in it —
A: Yes, he — he had this idea, and he came up with a solution, and it — and it
worked.
Q: Did he then try and sell the stamps, or — in later times, or did he keep them?
What happened to them?
A: Well, stamp collecting is — is a —1s a very chancy business, and there’s a market
for it sometime, and sometimes not, and certain stamps are more expensive than
others, and — and it doesn’t always happen to be a— a— a continuous growing —

guess it helped to keep the family going.
Q: Oh. Yeah. So, when you left Germany, do you remember anything of what you
were feeling, as you were leaving? Did y — when you left Germany, do you
remember anything of what you were feeling, as you were leaving? Whether or not
you were glad to leave, whether you were sad to leave?
A: Well, at this time, tension had grown to the point where we were very much
relieved to leaving. I mean, there was no question, after seeing what happened to
the — to the art store, and the fear that was common now among friends. I mean, the
— the discussion among the women in the club now was only about who went
where, and who can find someplace to go. And the only place you could go to,
actually, was Shanghai, which became a refugee settlement, and I believe this
museum had the exhibit there one time of it. And it — it was the only country where
you could absolutely go with no questions asked. Every other country was not —
there was just no one there willing to do this. A-And that was the greatest block.
Q: That must have been a hu — I— I mean, the — the sense — I’m trying to picture
what kind of an — what kind of a shock a community, not only individuals, but a
community can feel, at — if — if, in the 1930, and 1931, still feel self-confident,
strong, powerful, integrated. All of a sudden, it’s marginalized. If it was a

community where people were involved in international business, and had trips
abroad, and was a well-to-do, and all of a sudden the doors are closed.
A: Yeah.
Q: That must be quite a feeling of betrayal. Do you think that — that that permeated,
that that was what the sense was?
A: There were people who did go to China, I mean, because they had no other — no
other escape. But not many. I mean, this was a well-to-do community, and they
were not about to go into a country where they didn’t have all the ec — a-amenities
that they were used to. I-I think that’s part of it, I mean, that was just — but there
were people who did.
Q: Yeah.
A: I mean, I have [indecipherable] who ended up in Shanghai, and eventually
came back to the States, and were not the worse off for having done so. But that —
those were very few.
Q: Well, let’s talk about the relatives who remained. You had a large family, an
extended family, even though your own was small for people. You had aunts and
uncles in Germany, in Estonia. What happened to them? Did they survive? Did
they die?

leave in enough time. In — in the fact he was so careful, he had sent his two sons to
London to open a business, or to start some business, and when he came there was
already a — a foot in the door, and he was able to use his business skills to make it
into a very prosperous business. I mean, he was a very wealthy man in London, as
he was in Berlin. My father’s family just was wiped out, I mean that — that was all

Tallinn was not damaged to any extent, and it was a — he lived a — quite a normal

while we were still 1n — in the middle 30s, or maybe later on, for medical treatment,
and she died. And so that left my grandfather and his two sons, and their families.
Some of them ended up Israel, and in fact, his — one of his sons is in Israel.
Q: Was there anybody in the family who stayed in Berlin and survived?
A: There — there is no — yes. There was a distant cousin. I can’t remember the
relationship in [indecipherable]. He was a — an academician, a — a — a very

that. He — he was a —a very studious guy. He escaped to France, and was sheltered

would find identities, new identities. When buildings were bombed in Berlin, she
reported to the local Gestapo of whatever housing committee there was, and said
that she lost all of her identification in the bombing. And she did this several times,
so that she had different identities over a period of time.
Q: So she was hiding in plain sight.
A: She was hiding in plain sight, using — using that technique of finding identities
from bombed out homes. My father had a good, close friend who was in the rowing
club. The man was a-— well, he — he was a World War I officer.
Q: Do you remember his name?
A: His name was well — George Susskind(ph), and he had a wife, and a child, a
daughter. In fact, she was the one with whom I used to play in the club. And his
wife and he were close friends, as all these members were. But during the war, he
was a — an officer. I’m not sure what rank he had, but he commanded a unit of men,
and they were in the midst of a battle, and they had dug in for the night. And he
said, shells are flying overhead, and one of these are going to come down short, and
you better move away. And I’m moving wi-— myself, and whoever wants to come
along, come along with me. And one of the people who came with him was his, sort

wiped out the company of men. And the orderly, from that day on, was forever

A: George Susskind(ph) had no way to leave Germany, he and his family were
just unable to find any way, even though he was a prosperous banker, and obviously
had good connections, but there was no possible way for him to go out. As soon as
— and be-because the orderly was so grateful to George, they had an annual meeting
in Christmas time, when they had dinner together, I think at George’s home,
because he probably had a very ostentatious home. And when this man, who

became a policeman — but throughout the Nazi period, they would still have these
annual meetings. At one point, when Jews were required to put on the star, the guy
said to him, you know what? You better come see me in my office. And George
went to see him, and from that point on, this guy gave him identification papers of
some other name. And throughout the war, he was able to do that periodically, so
that he would always be able to move somewhere else, find a place to live, work
somewhere. And he was able to get his food stamps, which are needed, and a
passport, through this police officer, who by this time became a senior police officer
in the German police forces. His wife went — and I’m not sure exactly what the
situation was, but he and — she and the daughter went to some family on the farm
somewhere, and hid, were in hiding, in fact. And stayed that way throughout the
war. Before I go into the after war story, I'd like to talk about the burning of the
synagogue. When Kristallnacht was the day, or the night during which every
Jewish store was not only demolished, but every synagogue was burned. The only
exceptions were synagogues that were built within certain apartment blocks, and
would have been too dangerous to put them on fire, so they were — one, I think was
saved, that’s it. Many years after this, my father received a letter from the rabbi of
the synagogue, with whom my father had corresponded before, and he sent him the
— his own personal observation of the burning of the synagogue.

A: Regettin(ph). Prince Regettin(ph) Strasse.
Q: Okay.
A: A-And that was wa — how we identified the synagogue. I have a picture of that
synagogue afterwards, burned. But he described exactly what happened that day. He
was called in the middle of the night by the caretaker of building, he was not
Jewish, who said, our synagogue 1s burning. And the rabbi immediately hastened to
the site, and stood there while the firemen, who were carefully hosing down all the
buildings nearby, so that they would not catch on fire, but left the synagogue
burning. It burned into a shell. The walls were still standing, but everything else
was gone. It was a beautiful synagogue, and I used to go there and — and look up
into the ceiling, which was domed, and there were stars. And I knew that’s where
God was. That was my connection to the synagogue. It was a very sad experience.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
Martin Swarzenski, the rabbi was one of the great rabbis of the Jewish
community. The Jewish community, by the way, in Germany, I think to this day,
rabbis and church officials are government employees, they get paid by the
government, so the community doesn’t ever have to worry about paying for their
ministers. But h-he was a dedicated rabbi. He was a very courageous man. He
insisted on staying be — though he had an opportunity to leave, until they finally
arrested him, put him in a concentration camp, and because he had a visa or permit
to leave Germany, he was eventually let go. He became a rabbi in the United
States, in Madison, Wisconsin. While I was working here at the museum, as a
visitor service, a man started talking to me about his community in Madison,
Wisconsin. And he said he was a member of one of those fraternal brotherhoods,
which had an annual dedication, or ceremony when Swarzenski died. He was there
the rabbi — this man was not Jewish. But this organization honored him for having
been outstanding activist in interfaith activities.
Q: Oh my. Oh my.
A: So it was — it was like a — a —a lightning from heaven.
Q: Yeah.

him, and all of a sudden this total stranger talks to me about what happened to —

here as he was in Berlin. Did fantastic work. Anyhow, that was — the rabbis in
Berlin, and they — they were well-known, and there were not — they were scholars
in their own fields, and — stuck with their congregations. And many of them went to
camp, and —
Q: Perished.
A: — perished there.
Q: But this also means that probably the synagogue burned down while you were
still in Berlin, is that right?
A: Since it burned down Kristallnacht, yes, but I was not aware of that, until —
Q: I see.
A: — I mean, I knew it had burned, because every other synagogue had burned too,
and we had no longer — could no longer go to synagogue. I mean, my mother, at this
point was so involved with trying to get us out —
Q: Yeah.
A: — that going to the synagogue was — and — and I guess maybe it was — she was
fearful. But the synagogues were crowded. I mean, if they’re — if — if — if the Jews

of a sudden, where people felt that somehow there was greater safety in being part
of a community than being by yourself.
Q: Could also be appeal to God.
A: Yeah, well —
Q: You know?
A: It — it was a— a change in the — I mean, Jews were being accused of integrating,
and not living a good, religious life. But if anything turned the Jewish community, it
was this experience.

A: Yeah, it was late December. Was after Christmas — I believe it was after
Christmas, 1938.
Q: Okay.
A: And we went to England.
Q: You saw your father again?
A: My father was there, and he had an apartment. It was not big enough for all of
us, So I was chosen to be given away. The Jewish community in London was very
helpful. They not only provided us with clothing, but also found a family with
which I could live, which was a very Orthodox Jewish family, and for the first time

the sacrifices these people made, you know, you could only understand that when
you put yourself in that situation, how many people would you take into your home
Q: Yeah.
A: — who have come from nowhere, and you have actually no idea who they were.
But they insisted that I have my Bar Mitzvah in London, because they were
certain that they don’t know how to do Bar Mitzvah in the United States. Which
is, of course, very funny. But they insisted I do that, and I had an awful hard time,
because all I needed to do was learn the blessing with the Torah, and that was about
as much as I could manage. And I finally did get that out of me. And that was the
entire ceremony.
Q: Oh my.

be my mother because she was the only one who could actually speak English, went
to the U.S. embassy, and again started pleading, and all of a sudden they accepted
both of these applic — affidavits.
Q: The original, and the second?
A: The original, and the — supported by the other one, they felt that this was — which
it should be a normal thing, I mean, if the —1f the uncle provides an affidavit, you
would expect that he would then also accept the family, and that the supporting
affidavit was there for financial reasons, if it ever came to that. We did go — we left
in late January, on the Aquitania, which was a ship that looked exactly like the
Titanic. It was a four-stacker, and 1-1t — I have a little model at home on my

pleasant journey. We were in tourist class, my father did have those tickets. And we

us. I remember we had one incident — we had a couple of incidences on the ship I —
I just want to mention, because they — the — I — I—I did love to be on the ship. I
mean, I could tell because of my early years on boats, I loved the water. I became a
sailor eventually, but this was the early initiation to the season, I loved it. I used to
be on the fantail, which was the — one of the places we were permitted to go. In
those days these classes were very much separated, and you couldn’t just walk in
anywhere you want to. So I went up to a little — a boy who was my age, and we start
talking. My English by this time must have been good enough to ask for — a few
questions. And so I ask him where he was from, and he said to me, D.C. And I said,
what’s the city called? He said, D.C. I said, where is it? D.C. And by this time I
walked away from him, because I didn’t figure he had it all, I mean. And of course,
that’s where we ended up, in D.C.

sitting on a bus, or a streetcar, I’m not sure which it was, that took us to downtown
Scranton. The — we were — the whole city sits on a hill. Things go up, we went

down, downhill. And he took me to the store, and as I say, I remember the smell
[indecipherable]. But he wanted to teach me something about the United States,
something about English. And in this streetcar, which was not full, he pointed to
one man who was sitting way down on the other end, he said, that’s a bum. And
that’s how he introduced me to the different kinds of people I’m expected to, I
guess, stay away from, and — and others who were [indecipherable]

A: — you do not — you do not go to bums.
Q: Yeah. Did you work in his store?
A: No. School for me was itse — itself a— a — a new — a new adventure. I was 13
years old, I was tall, lanky, and I was — I — I think they sent me to school
immediately. I was in school not far from where we lived, and they put me in the
second grade.

A: Thirteen year old. They wanted to put me in first grade, but probably didn’t have
a seat big enough, so here I was, the tallest kid in school, and I was sitting in a seat
that would — barely accommodated me, with all the little kids of second graders.
And I had to turn — learn English. There was no English for foreign language
speakers, that didn’t exist. I was lucky only in that the teacher was Jewish, and she
spoke a little Yiddish. And Yiddish is so much like German that every once in a
while she’ll sidle up to me and she tells me what was going on. And in that way I
had somewhat of a notion what was going on. But I learned, I learned English. I
soon was immediate transported two grades further up the line, and I made it til I
was with my classmates in eighth grade.
Q: How long did that take?
A: Oh, now you ask me some very difficult questions.
Q: Well, was it the same school year?
A: Oh yeah, same — same school, same — 1-it was within one year, yes, because I
was 13. At 14, I was supposed to be in high school.

Q: How were your grades?
A: I—I suddenly became a real scholar. I — I can’t believe that this happened to the
kid who couldn’t sit still in class, was told by teachers he — just about the only thing
good about me was my behavior, and here I was, all of a sudden ala — ev-evolved
into something much more. I wa — I —I tell you what one of the advantages was that
I had; I had to speak English. I would not speak German at home, I would not speak
to my parents in German. And my two best friends, also from Germany, we would
never speak German with each other.
Q: And that was because?
A: We just would not. I mean, Germany became a country we just would not have
anything to do with.
Q: And your parents — I was go — I wanted to ask this question earlier. At — at some
point, when they were in the United States, to one another, did they continue
speaking in German, or did they also go into English?
A: They spoke German, yes, they spoke German, because my father just couldn’t
communicate in any other language. My mother, by the way, was almost fluent in
English. And so I had no problem communicating with them, but I would not speak
German. And — and that was obviously to my advantage.

A: He had a suitcase, and he was selling, I have no idea what, but things that poor
families might buy. And that’s what —
Q: It’s also hard if you don’t speak English.
A: He couldn’t speak English, and he was working in a Polish district. So they
couldn’t speak English either. And how they communicated with one another is a
mystery to me. But he was good at it, because he — he said — and he told me this in
confidence, he had some holy pictures too, and he even had some water that — a-and
I didn’t want to hear any more, this was — this was going over the line. But he
somehow managed — he did not make much money. My mother, meanwhile,
became a very successful piano teacher. She had never been to school to become a
teacher, but she was gifted, and she knew how. In fact, she used the typical
European methods, which meant mostly yelling at the kids, curve your fingers, and
being about as nasty as you can be. And mothers seemed to go for that. I mean, they
thought that children need a little discipline, and here was Lola doing all this, and
they learned to play piano.
Q: By the way, did you learn to play piano?
A: No, she never could teach me how to play the piano, and I’m sorry to this day

the methods didn’t work too well.
Q: So, did your mother become the major breadwinner, because her — she was well
A: I—I would say yes, for a while. And then my father came up with the idea that
why not become a window trimmer.
Q: Again.
A: Again. And he did that until he died at age 75. In fact, he worked the day he
died, in a window. Came home, went to a concert at night, and that night — that
night went to bed, never — and died in his sleep. Was a heart attack.
Q: Wow.
A: But he was a very good decorator. I — if I say my mother was a breadwinner, I —
I’m not sure that she was much of a contributor of money. I think she hoarded her
money, which was — the whole thing was very difficult for my father, because
German men are supposed to be the breadwinners, and they’re not supposed to be
told by their wives what money there is, or how to spend it. And — and this was
obviously not the — the case here. And so I think he had, from that point on, a
different kind of relationship with his wife. He was still very much in love with his

could tell there was a difference here. My father was quite successful as a window
dresser.
Q: Was that still in Scranton? He started — did he still start doing that in Scranton?
A: He started in Scranton. I must say the Jewish store owners were very helpful. I
think they tended to hire him, and — and that was helpful. And he was talented, and
people really stopped to look at his windows, as they were — they were outstanding.
Q: What did he think of all of the windows that are done in New York City, you
know, for those special holidays, or —
A: Oh, well, he — he was a-aware of that. He — he — he — he did buy his supplies, I
think, in New York, and then eventually, I — I —I—I think he did find them, he — he
did work very hard, he was very ambitious, in terms of what he had to do. He was a
careful craftsman, and there was never any complaint about what he was doing.

College was not a subject in my family. So I went to technical high school, I got to
learn everything that you can possibly learn. I knew electrical work, and I did
machine shop work, I even did some welding. And I enjoyed all of this. I was not
particularly good in these fields, I must say, but I enjoyed doing that.

A: This was not college prep, not in the least. And after three years, my father saw
an ad in the “New York Times,” for a position in window dressing for a store in
New London, Connecticut. My father went to New London, took one look at the
beach, and said, that’s where I want to live for the rest of my life. Said, I don’t care
what kind of work it is. And he did, he moved. And my mother immediately started
a studio, and she was again very successful. And we lived in a — very modestly, but
very comfortably, because we had — couldn’t ask for more. We had a beautiful
beach, and we spent a good bit of time on the summer there.

was still in Scranton. And I had only one year in New London for high school.
Q: Excuse me, before we go on there again, I — the reason why I ask about the war
years is, how did your family react, how did your parents react when they — when
the U.S. — when the war started in Europe? That is, the U.S. hadn't entered the war
yet, but Germany attacked Poland. And what was the discussions like in your
house at that time?

A: Well, it was a subject of intense interest. I mean, I saved the newspaper
clippings, and I had stocks of stuff all about the war. The war was a center of our
interest. We — we knew a great deal about it. I’m not sure whether I was aware that I
would become a part of the war, but even though I didn’t know anyb — think about
it, the war was of — of major interest to — to all of us.
Q: Your parents, had they felt like they adjusted well in the United States?
A: My — my mother certainly did. My father, because of his language difficulties,
and his strong attachment to Germany did interfere with his full satisfaction with
living in the United States. But he adjusted. He continued the stamp collection, and
he was very happy in New London. So I — I can’t say that he was unhappy at li — at
least. I don’t think he’d move ever again, if he had the opportunity, because this was
about as nice as it could get, both for him and for my — my mother. So it was very
nice.
Q: So you were finishing your last year of high school in New London?
A: I went again to a technical high school, and this time th-the princi — principal
insisted that we have at least some college preparation. I didn’t have to worry about
a second language, but I did have several courses that sort of led to college, if that
ever came up. In other words, this school was not so totally dedicated as the first
one, to purely technical subjects. I became a good student. I was always near the top

A: Well, it became that, among other things, yes. It was a big camp. It was
unbelievably hot, this was in the middle of summer. We came by train. I couldn’t
believe that any human being could exist in such heat. Like some old man walking
across — but I thought he was in the air because the heat comes — coming up from
the asphalt, and made like he was walking on air. It — 1-it all was just an
unbelievable situation. But I got used to it, and I was trained to be a machine-
gunner, which kind of ironic, since my father had the same profession — m-military
profession. And I was a —I mean, I survived very neatly, and I mean, I did not have
any problems.
Q: Were your parents concerned about you being in the army?
A: Well, my father probably more so than my mother, I’m not sure, but both were
concerned, of course they were. Cause there wa — this was a time of great casualties.
D-Day was a landing of the beaches in France was about that time, and we had
enormous casualties then. And we — I finished my basic training the end of the
summer, and was then shipped out to southern Italy. By this time it got to be very
cold, and Italy was the coldest place on earth, as far as I could tell. The army didn’t
think so either, because they gave us all summer uniforms, and no blankets, no
sweaters, and we were just freezing all the time. It was the coldest I’ve ever — I

think it was one of the coldest winters Europe had ever experienced, and even
southern Italy was not at all what they thought it would be.
Q: Would this have been °45?
A: This was °44.
Q: Forty-four, the winter of °44.
A: Forty-four. Winter of ’44 - °45, yes. We marched constantly back and forth, in
the lil — waiting for someone to — I guess I — waiting for a machine-gunner to die.
And I was already told that when your machine-gunner opens up fire, he has about
30 seconds to live. It was one of those deadly weapons that everyone will focus on
to get out of the way. So m-my future was not looking very bright, but I was a very
happy young guy, and I wasn’t being bothered by such silly things.

A: Well, Italy was p-par — you know, we — we were in the southern part, and there
were little villages, and most I can remember about them was they smelled God
awful. They were making wine, and they were pouring wine down the gutters that
wasn’t used, or couldn’t be used, and that in cou — in addition to whatever cows left
behind, was a combination that was hard to beat. You could smell these villages a
mile away. And we were just trudging with our guns, and machine guns, and I —
mortar was the other weapon I was trained on. And I was just waiting for the day
that they would say, okay, you’re — you’re up next. One day I was called out of my
tent. We were sleeping in eight men tent, 10 man tents, and they were drafty and
cold and it was terrible. I was called out, I was told to put on my uniform. In those
days we had uniforms, we were not walking around in fatigues, as the army does
today. We had nice uniforms, we put them on. I was taken to Caserta, which was
this little town south of Naples — north of Naples. And a guy came up to me and
says, do you want to jump out of an airplane and kill Germans behind the lines?
Now mathematically I was no genius, but I figured out it takes longer to jump down
from an airplane than it does — than 30 seconds, which I had on the other job. So, I
was able to multiply my life expectancy by a good bit. I'd never been in an airplane
before. The idea of jumping out of an airplane was so horrible, that I never even

give second thoughts to it. I guess they’ ll have to push me out if — if 1t comes to
that.
Q: So that you had a minute to live, rather than 30 seconds.
A: Exactly. We had this — it’s all figured out.
Q: Yeah.
A: Before I knew it, I was moved from a tent, which was drafty, and dirty and poor,
to a villa on the Adriatic, with maids to make beds, and a chef to do fabulous
cooking. I thought at that point that I must have died and gone to heaven. We — we
spent a good bit of time on the beach. The training was sort of — I would say it was
sort of mundane. They were not really eager to make feisty guys out of us, and I
would think that I should have been better trained to do the kind of job they wanted
me to do. They did teach me how to jump out of an airplane by putting me on top of
a treehouse that the guy who owned the building, the villa, must have built for his
kids, and it was just high enough to make it a little bit of a challenge, but not too
much of a challenge to jump down.
Q: And that was the training?
A: That, and they told me how to use knives. And I found out that when you get in a
knife fight, the best thing to do is turn around as fast as you can, get away from

A: It turned out to be the OSS, yes.
Q: When did you find out?
A: They didn’t tell me that at the beginning —
Q: Okay.
A: — but eventually it came to me. But what I was most impressed by was the
people who were there, at least for now, for the first time in my life that I came
across real college graduates. I mean, these are people who had gone to five
schools. They talked differently. They didn’t use the same language they did in my
tent. Some of the adv — adverbs and adjectives never even existed in their language.
And I found them reading books, and I was — became quite enchanted with this
whole gang. Actually, this unit I was in, which was called the Austria unit, had a
fabulous operation, which is maybe a subject by itself, but they did —
Q: What did they do? Tell me.
A: Well, they — they did — a matter of fact, there were a good number of refugees
like myself, who spoke fluent German, and who could mingle with the population
and get away with it, and who went up behind the lines. Many of those operations

that. But in one case, one of the people who were in my unit was dispatched, long
before I joined the junit — th-the unit, to a location in Austria, and he was able to
communicate with the air force through a device they gave you, a big piece of
equipment that — with which you can contact headquarters of — to — to direct the air
force to bomb German supply trains, which came through the Brenner Pass to
Italy, where the fighting was still going very heavy. And he was able to tell them
where the trains were, because there was no other way to find this out, and when
they would come out of the tunnel. It was a great piece of work. He was event —
Q: And so it was successful. They —
A: Very successful. And he was eventually captured. He was sorely beaten by the
Gestapo. This all from the report which the captor, the SS guard reported when we
took over Austria, and interrogated him on what he was doing to our man. And so
we have it from him, and we have it from the man himself. Terribly beatings. Tied
him to chairs and beat and beat him and he wouldn’t give up his team — his
teammates were still hiding somewhere — until he was sure that they could be —
could have found another location to hide. He was then put into a concentration
camp, and he talked his way out of the concentration — and this 1s all close to the
end of the war. Patton, with his tanks, was not far away. And I could see it was

of continue this practice of killing people. He was let go, and he made his way to
Innsbruck, which was actually his hometown, I believe, somewhere in there
[indecipherable]. He met with the mayor of the town, and convinced him not to
fight the army — the u — in other words, to give himself up, as a city. To — to open

very sad place. I mean, the — the Jewish population in Vienna consisted mainly of
whoever escaped, and was able to get out of Germany, and out of Austrian Gestapo
camps. I remember being at a service for — not sure, probably a Seder. And there
were these people who, you know, wore old clothes that were given to them by
people that no longer could use these clothes, and — and it was a very sad looking
people. The — the Viennese themselves had little food. I remember some person
who was grateful to me for — an elderly woman who — whom I gave I don’t know
what to. I had all this — all these cigarettes and all this liquor, and I just gave it
away, and — to whoever I thought might be able to make something out of it. And

A: We — we — that was another section. My — my section was just concerned with
that, and m — you know, there was a tremendous fear, actually, in the — at first, as to
why do they have all these Soviet troops? They never did go — they never went
home, they never were demobilized, rather. I mean, the Americans couldn’t
demobilize us fast enough —
Q: Yeah.
A: — to get out of the army. And here were the Soviets full companies, and still
exercising. I mean, it became clear eventually, the reason they had them there,
because they had no jobs for them back in Russia. And obviously it was safer to
keep them a-at bay in — in Austria and Germany, than to bring them home. That

was probably one of the main reasons they were there. They might have had other
ideas too, but the fact that they’d start another war seemed most unlikely. And was
a very — I mean, it was a very easy job, it was one that I enjoyed thoroughly because
I, for the first time had my — my eyes opened to — to the things which I — which wa
—I would never find anywhere else. We went to numerous theaters, and concerts,
and re-really took full advantage of whatever there was in — in — in Austria at the
time.
Q: But were there any — as you — before you got to Vienna, were there any places
that, when you were coming into Austria, where you did have to interrogate, let’s
say, any former Nazis, or any former enemy, any combatants or — or you know,
people of that kind.
A: The one of our dues — before I came to Vienna, we were involved with what was
actually an army project, but we were there assisting, I guess, which was to collect
scientists. I mean, the army immediately began looking — I mean, as soon as they hit
Germany, there was a special detachment of the army which started looking for
any scientist who had anything to do atomic work.
Q: Okay.
A: And there’s a book written about that, which was quite interesting, the extent to
which these people had to dig to find people, and to uncover the stolen and hidden

art pieces, and other jewelry and — and — and — and mal — any — anything of value
that Hitler, in particular Goring had stashed away in various caves in Germany.
That was a special unit that just did that. But we were looking for scientists, and —
and we didn’t have to look hard, we simply said, we’re looking for scientists, and
they came from all corners of Germany.
Q: They came to find you?
A: Oh yes. The idea that they might go to the United States was enough of an
attraction to — we — we practically had to shoo them away, and eventually we had so
many people who claimed to be scientists and had really nothing to offer. But I did
have one case, which I think was quite interesting. It’s the -a—a-—a woman
appeared, who was a very small — she was small stature, and her name was Hanna
Reitsch.
Q: Who was she?
A: She was a topmost German test pilot. She actually flew their latest developments
in jet aircraft, and was obviously very valuable to our — our people. And for some
reason she came to me, or I was assigned to talk to her. And it was not an
interrogation, these were discussions we had with people, because there was neither
the time, nor the facilities for doing anything more than that. And as I was talking to
her, she pulls out of her handbag, whatever she had, a huge medal, which was a

swastika surrounded by diamonds. There was a whole ring of diamonds, around a
huge swastika, which itself was made of diamonds. It was just unbelievably heavy.
She gave it to me, and I held it and I looked at it, I said, I don’t want anything to do
with this sort of stuff. I gave it back to her, and to this day I wonder what she ever
did with it, because she took it, I’m sure, back. She ended up in the United States,
and she became a citizen, and I think a good citizen, and obviously was helpful to
the aircraft people here in the States.
Q: But how did you feel when — when it sounds as if, from your telling, that there
was no punitive interest at all, in — from the U.S. military side, and the OSS, at least
the arm that you were involved 1n, or the unit you were involved in, in catching
anybody who would have — the word is war criminal, but who would have been
involved in, let’s say the persecution of — of — of Jews, of civilians, or anything like
that?
A: No, you know, that-that’s an interesting question, because I — I could never find
the answer to that. They — there were obviously teams doing that, I mean, the army
had far more facilities and personnel to do that kind of work than we did. I mean,
our work was so specifically targeted against information that we needed, that the
idea that these might be people who would be of interest for other reasons, or Nazis
of [indecipherable]. Not in my unit. I— I do — I don’t speak for the OSS, because it

was just too diverse, and there were too many different people doing too many
different things, for me to say what OSS was doing. I can only say my unit had this
one task, which was to interrogate, or at least to — to get to know a scientist well
enough to make a judgment whether it’s worthwhile to send him onto somebody
more technically competent to do the interrogation. And she obviously was one of
those people.
Q: You didn’t feel an internal tension though, because of this?
A: I’m sorry?
Q: You didn’t feel an internal tension because of this?
A: Not at all, no, no, I mean, these were people, and — and — and we treat them as
people, as — you know, whatever value they had was because of their skills, or their
profession, whatever they could offer us. And th-there was never really any feeling
of vengeance, in th — any of — certainly not with me. I mean, I had no —
Q: Had you known by this time what had happened to some of your family?
A: We knew very little. I mean, we really didn’t know anything about concentration
camps —
Q: Or Uncle Max, or —
A: We had no idea. I mean, I didn’t. I don’t think my unit did. This was something
we didn’t get into. I— I — I knew there were people who were obviously in — in — in

concentration camps, because I met them at — if no place else, in Vienna. But I
could not relate and — I mean, I couldn’t go much further than that.
Q: Okay. Did you get back to Berlin?
A: I did go back to Berlin. My — the leader of my unit, the head of it, called me one
day and said, you must have family in Berlin, or do you have friends? Yes, I do, I
believe I do. I s— I sent my father a letter, as a matter of fact, I said, 1s anyone still
alive? And as it was, he had found in a German-Jewish newspaper — what was it
called? “Aufbau.” “Aufbau.” Which was read by every Jewish refugee in
Germany, because it had, among other things, people searching for contacts,
relatives. And among them was a Susskind(ph), the man that I described before.
Q: Who was saved by that policeman, who had been his orderly.
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and he was looking for my father, who was his close friend. And then my
father sent me the address, in Berlin, so I had a place to go to. And I was given — I —
I —I got to Berlin, they — they made me a courier, and I was officially flying on the

A: Yes, you could pushed out. And I — I — that was my first airplane ride. I — I was
sure I wasn’t going to like it, but I enjoyed that too. It was — I came to Berlin,
which — I — I was devastated. I mean, th-th-the city was in to-total rubble.
Q: Could you recognize it?
A: You could recognize it only because the facades were still there, but everything
else had sort of fallen apart. And I did find the address, so it was possible to drive
through the city, and find a place, because I did find them. They were living in what
was then still east Berlin, but the — the lines were not fixed as they — they are now —
or were then, not now —
Q: Yeah, yeah, afterwards, mm-hm.
A: You know. Now they’re fine.
Q: Yeah.
A: No lines. But the borders were not tightly controlled. And I met the same — I — I
met George, and his family, which had now come together. They were living in a
house, very nicely. I bought him his first box of cigars. And his daughter was sure
that I came to marry her. Now, how she got this idea, I don’t know. I certainly never
communicated with her. But my showing up, and her being there, I guess put two -
two together and she had this — but I — first of all, I had a girlfriend in the States,
and I was very faithful to her. And I didn’t have any interest any more in marrying

else. So —

have some way of —
A: I—I don’t know.
Q: You don’t know.
A: I—I think he became quite active — he be — I know that he became quite active in
the Jewish community.
Q: Did he stay in the eastern section of Berlin?
A: He probably stayed there until he f— eventually moved out, because I met him
again many years later, some years later. And he — he did move out of there, but I
don’t know when. He probably stayed there for a long time, because that — that was
a very comfortable place to be, I could tell that.
Q: Did you remember anything of the conversation you had with him? Did he talk
about what had happened in Berlin, after your family had left?
A: I’m sorry, I don’t know. I— I’m not sure I talked with him about that. It was such
a — you know, e-emotional meeting, that — that we simply wanted to be sure that we
are okay, and that he is okay. That was — that was the main purpose of my going

Q: Yeah.
A: — and then, obviously it would have been better. But they were li — living a —
what — what I could see was a fairly normal life.
Q: Do you — did you ever find out what happened to the orderly, who became the
policeman, who became his protector?
A: Iam sure they still me — as a matter of fact, he was mentioned. He was — he was
— he — Susskind(ph), who, as I said, was a fairly — very active member of the
Jewish community, had certain positions in that community, which was just
beginning to find its life, recommended him to be one of the — they call it Christian
— can’t remember — I’m sorry, words escape me. They — there was a special
memorial set aside in Yad Vashem in Israel, to remember the Christians who help
Jews. There’s a term for that, I can’t remember.

who actively helped, certainly kept George alive. He may have done more.
Q: Okay, okay. What else did you — did you find your old home address?
A: Well, I did that. I did two things. I went back to the neighborhood in which I
lived last. I went to both neighborhoods. The first one, where I was born, was only
exterior damage. People were living in the street — 1-in the buildings, but they were
all pockmarked with shells, old shells. The neighborhood to which I moved in
Elssho — in Haberland Strasse, the Bayerischer Platz neighborhood, was totally
damaged. I mean, the — the house had fallen into what looked like a personnel
carrier, which seemed to have gotten its way into the entryway. The building had
collapsed on top of it. It was as badly damaged as anything could be. Then I went to
see the synagogue, which was still the same as it was when it was burned. I had not
seen it then, but I saw it this time, and I could see this was not a picture of that, it’s
a Shell. But every house in the neighborhood was bombed. It was like somebody
must have watched this synagogue being burned, and all these houses next to them
being saved, that a stick of bombs must have hit that whole neighborhood. That was
my main experience, that the —

A: Oh, Austria was practically undamaged.
Q: Yeah. But Berlin, going to Berlin, was there — was your feeling different when
you were in Berlin than when you had come to Austria? Because Berlin is home.
Berlin is where you came from.
A: I did not have a home-like attachment to Germany.
Q: Okay.
A: Germany was a phase in my life that I guess I just subjected.
Q: You didn’t meet any former neighbors, or anybody like that?
A: No, nothing. I mean, there was nobody there. People wouldn’t live in the
neighborhoods any more. They couldn’t live in those neighborhoods, cause it was
too dangerous. These houses were falling all the time. I-It was a — I had absolutely
no feelings of anything about this.
Q: So it — it’s — it’s unusual. I guess I’m going after this because it’s an unusual
circumstance, that somebody who was born there, raised there, lived there until
their 13" year, is more or less booted out, or el — you know, the — your choices at
age 13 had been, if I stay I probably don’t survive, and if I go, they’re going to
make sure that they get everything, you know, you go out with only a few marks,
and un — you know, surprisingly, we got our furniture. But, you know, that’s it. And
then you come back as part of the winners, of the — the — the winning force, and an

elite unit of the winning force. That’s a juxtaposition, you know, leaving in one
way, and returning in another.
A: Well, I was certainly ga — I — I had no feeling of being under — in any danger at
all, except when I went to the Jewish cemetery. I bumped into a Soviet soldier in
uniform. I was in uniform too, so was no mistaking me.
Q: Was the cemetery in the Soviet sector?
A: In the Soviet sector, the Jewish community, that whole area that east Berlin was
in the Soviet sector. He actually took his gun off his shoulder, point it at me and
says, come. And I simply acted like I didn’t understand the term, and I walked
away. And to this day I wonder why he didn’t shoot me. Cause he seemed to be
ready to do so, and somehow good conscience must have set in. But that was the
closest I ever came to being in actual danger. To this day, I remember. I was a lucky
guy. The girl f — the girl was with me, her name was Ava, Ava Susskind(ph).
Q: Aha, who —
A: She eventually —
Q: — who thought that you were going to be her —
A: Yeah, she thought I was going to marry her, but she married a guy who took her
to the States actually, somewhere in the — the Washington - Oregon area. She
disliked it immediately, and went back to Berlin. And I may have known this, but I

certainly must have felt it, that she was very close to her parents, that she was never
leave — would never leave her parents, and that — this idea that she would come to
the States may — would never wor — and it didn’t work out, I mean, she was just —
she stayed there until her husband died, and — she married twice actually, second
husband died. So it was — 1-1-1t was a very interesting — I — I don’t remember any
real emotional consequences from this. It — it certainly was, 1n some fashion, to see
your old neighborhood again, to be able to recognize it. And — and — but, if I did
this several times, I went back to Berlin a number of times. Last time I took the
whole family, all my kids, and grandchildren. And I wanted to show them where I
lived, and by this time Berlin, cause was perfectly rebuilt. They rebuilt my street,
Haberland Strasse to where it be — was exactly as it was before. They used the
same plans. The number on my — on the house where I lived, 30, was the same as it
was when I lived in it. Every inch of it looked exactly the same way as it did when I
lived there. And so much of Berlin is actually been rebuilt that way, so the city still
looks like an old, well-kept — now well-kept city. The neighborhood where I was
born, where I played in the [indecipherable] the — the garden is still the pl — the
little plaza, is still there, the justice building is still there. It became the headquarters
of the four power allied conference. They had their meetings in that place, it was a —
a very stately building, and certainly suitable for that purpose. And there it was,

right in my neighborhood, and that’s where I saw the Jewish la — the Jewish lawyers
being whisked away, somewhere.
Q: In that same building?
A: Hm’?
Q: In that same building?
A: In that same building, yes, that was exactly the same building. It was never really
much destroyed, because the allied moved into it as soon as they had got themselves
organized, because that became the headquarters. So it couldn’t have been bombed
very badly. As a matter of — my whole street, where I was born, was not that badly
bombed.

of a lower middle class neighborhood. We had — most attractive place in it was the
beer — the bierstube on the corner. It was just a real workmen’s district. When we
went back, was about two years ago, three years ago, with my family.

Q: You mean 2009, or 2010?
A: And 10, yeah, I guess we went back there.
Q: Yeah.
A: The street had become the other side of middle class. Now it became more like a
wealthy city — wealthy state. Houses were repainted, they looked gorgeous. I’m sure
they put elevators in all of the buildings. And when I looked at the placards outside
the building, they now were doctors and lawyers, and professionals of all sorts,
living in buildings that were really not suitable for that kind of clientele.
Q: When you were there the first time, so that’s at the end of the war. That still
would have been in 1945?
A: Yes, I— I was — about 1946, actually, ’45 - °46.
Q: Forty-five - °46. During that stint, when you still were working with the OSS in
Austria, did you go back many times, or was the many times you referred to
throughout the whole postwar years?

Q: Did you have any feeling about the Germans, even though you might not have
met any former neighbors?
A: You know, I’ve been asked that question, and I never have a good answer for
that, because I cannot really say honestly, that I hated people. My father and my
mother were totally different. They visited us eventually in Berlin, when I was
stationed there, but they felt that every person of a certain age was a Nazi, and
couldn’t get out of their heads that — that there was anybody else in Germany. I
didn’t have that experience. My —

Q: That’s right.
A: Even though they had no experience whatsoever. And I can understand that, too.
I mean, I would never say oh, that’s a silly thing to do. But the Jewish community
in Berlin now is tremendous. I mean, I think probably larger than it was when —
when we left there. It — the synagogues are flourishing. I attended services there
with my wife, and with — every seat was taken. The only thing that was different, I
looked at my neighbor’s prayer book, and it was in Russian.
Q: Well, that’s what I was going to ask you, is that it sounds to — it seems to me that
postwar Berlin Jewish community is basically not from Berlin.
A: Not from Berlin, no, no —
Q: Yeah.
A: — this is a whole new generation of people who are doing well. But they’re
mostly refugees from Russia. They were supposed to go from Russia to Vienna,
and Vienna to Israel, and instead of going to Israel —
Q: We’re talking now the 1970s.
A: — they went to Berlin.
Q: Yes, yes.

the Soviets doing when you were in Vienna.
A: Well, it —1t was a mixed bag, yes. We were [indecipherable] that too. But my
time was coming to an end. I went to Al Armand(ph). I said to him, you know, I’m
going back to the States, what do you think I should do? I had reached the — the
fabulous grade of Buck Sergeant, which is about as low as you can get in the
sergeant business, and I thought I was doing pretty good. He looked at me and he
said, why don’t you get yourself an education? Go to Princeton. I said, sure. I
never heard of Princeton, I never knew what he was talking about until I came
home and I said to my girlfriend — same girlfriend I had before.

so odd. I took a test or two, talked to somebody, and next thing I knew, I was at
Yale, and I spent four years there.
Q: What did you study?
A: I studied, of all things, history and Russian. And Russian kind of escaped — even
though I went home every weekend — hitchhiked, re — I became a very — a very
good hitchhiker. I hitched-hike home, and when I didn’t recheck home, Vivian
would come to — to new — to New Haven to wait, and we had a — it was a wonderful

gone back to Germany. But they ask you, what was it like? What can you tell us
about the Germans in the 1950s? What should we know, what should we understand
about them? What would you say?

theater, and we could live totally in isolation from the German people.

Q: That’s makes a difference.
A: It makes a difference. I don’t fi — I never really have felt any real animosity to
Germans. I mean, I — I have — I have the philosophy that people are people, and that
you can take any group of people, and make anything you want out of them, if you
have the right tools for it. And Goebbels was actually the master of that genre. He
was able to persuade the German people that there was indeed a danger, that Jews
had to be eliminated, and most Germans seemed to believe that. And unfortunately,
you could do that anywhere. I mean, you — we’ve seen this every day in our own
history, and we see it today in — 1n — in o — our efforts overseas, to create some kind
of order. People can be made to believe anything. We are a very unfinished specie
of animal. We still have a long ways to go.
Q: Well then, when you look back at the various parts of your life, is that one of the
lessons that you draw from your experiences, and from what has happened to you?
Are there other things that you think people need to understand about the Holocaust
aspect, and about what came later?
A: The Holocaust is simply an example of how easy it is to mislead people into
believing something. I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels, he did this with a

tactful — with a — with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people
believe the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you
want to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they
had different — you — you see upstairs, when you go through the mi — exhibits, they
measured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say non-
Aryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that,
you can | — you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they’re not
the same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory
went a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they
had some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one
way or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on
the Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin, went to the Jewish museum, and they had
exhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the
big department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you
know, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to
teach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first —
and they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first
thing you came across was the mikveh, to show people what ritual bath was like,
why it was there. And then from there and so progressingly, here’s what Judaism’s

all about. And it’s being taught. I’ve seen their schoolbooks, their curriculums, and
they are very careful to teach this, the Holocaust. So you can turn people from one
direction to another.
Q: Your own direction — and now I want to talk in more religious terms. You said
that you weren’t outside religion when you were growing up, but in postwar years,
here in the United States, did you become more religious, did you join a
synagogue, did you participate?
A: Yes, my family always was members of — and mine — my — my parents were,
and so was my family, yes, we — we have been very active in — in Jewish life. I was
president of my congregation, and my wife was president also. So we — we were
very much involved. Am I a religious person? I am not sure. Not sure.
Q: Okay.
A: But I- I—I’ve — I’ve a feeling I belong to these people, this is my tribe. And
that’s where I have to be. I mean, all this — you have no choice, you’re born into
this, and then you’re it, and you better make the most of it.
Q: Well, is there anything else you would like to say that you would want — is there
anything else you would like to say that you would want people to understand,
either about what your experiences were, or some thought that you’d want to leave
people with, or that you’d want your children to remember?

Interview with Gerald Liebenau
September 12, 2012
A: I—I’m not very good about the idea of changing people, or that people are
changeable. People are born with certain ideas, principles, and conduct, which is
theirs for life. And I’m always surprised at people being able to move from one
religion to another, or act in various capacities that they would normally not act. But
I do believe that the Jews kind of formed very early in life, and that you stick with
those ways because they seem comfortable to you, and you feel secure in that
environment.
Q: Yeah. Thank you.
A: Thank you.
Q: Thank you very much.
