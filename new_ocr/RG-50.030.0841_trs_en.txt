they put a — made an extra bed in my bedroom where I slept, and they put her in the
bed. But the Jewish custom is, you never put the head to the door, you put — you

Fulwein(ph). And she had a bad mar-marriage, and she got a divorce, and she had a
nervous breakdown. So they put her in an institution, and that was — that was the

found him dead in a — in a hotel room.
Q: Oh dear.
A: They thought it would be suicide, so we had a hard time to get — get him a proper
funeral, because Jewish people don’t believe in suicide, so the rabbi wouldn’t want
to come.

A: Yes, I did.
Q: Okay.
A: They had pictures, you see, and they gave me those pictures. Somehow I lost
them.
Q: Did you —
A: I got careless and threw them away, I guess.
Q: Well, people, when they stayed, or were in the places of either Germany, or the
occupied territories, lost everything. They didn’t have any photographs. So usually,
it was, if they have any pictures of their families before the wars, it’s because other
people had them, whom the photos had been sent to, and then they resupplied, you
know, the individual.
A: Well, that’s the way it was in Hamburg, then. After the — we lived in different
places in Hamburg, and then one day they — the German government said that all
Jews have to live closer together, and only in certain houses.
Q: Oh, I see.
A: So we had to move in an apartment house where — where mostly Jewish people,
family, in that house.

people on the outside would laugh, pointing. Oh, look at those Jews, they have to
stay in line to get their stuff. And I do remember we had an old age home very close

Her husband had a big radio store in one of the main streets — main streets in
Hamburg. And this lady already had a car; she was blonde. And she took my
mother, every second week they went someplace outside Hamburg, some nice
place, and they had coffee and cake, and I sometimes, or most of the time, went

what could we do, we didn’t have our fuehrer? And my mother and I were

guns —
A: They started screaming.
Q: Okay.
A: The minute they opened the door, they said, raus, you Juden [speaks German],
raus, raus. And then they had those — those gu — those big guns. They were hitting
people in the back because they didn’t run fast enough to the trucks, sitting on the
other side of the street. They were covered trucks. And the trucks were high, so
most people could not get in. So they picked the people up and threw them in there.
And I remember I was one of the last ones. I was on top, I don’t know how many
people were any which way under me.
Q: So it was like a pile of people.
A: Piles of people, just thrown in th — in this truck, and I was on top of it. And then
they started to move. And I can’t tell you — it took 45 minutes, an hour, I don’t
know the time, how long it took until we got to the ghetto. It was supposed to be
called sonderghetto, special ghettos for German Jews.

many volunteers to go inside the building and clean up. What happened was, they
had Russian Jews living in there before, and wa — and then when the announcement

they put saltpeter in the — in this soup. That means that they want to make men
sterile, they didn’t want that they have sex. They didn’t want to have more babies,
or anything like that. That was the start with that. And then a piece of bread, like a
piece of pie, the shape. And maybe a little margarine or butter, something like that.

Q: Tell me who they were.

do that, and — and [indecipherable] — I thought it was not my place to do. But I did
it. So that’s that. And then we come to Neuengamme. | can’t remember which, to

some gay people again. They said the Nazis are going to come any moment.
They’re going to — they’re going to go through the barracks. And they put us in the

And I have a book, a German book where another man was on the ship, and he
knows the name of the ship — I don’t know the name of the ship — but they didn’t
have time to do that because the American came already, so they were fleeing the
Nazis. And we saw in the distance, we saw tiny, little boats coming from Sweden.
The Red Cross came and took us down.

what holiday it was. It was a Sunday, too. We had breakfast, then we went for a
walk. And all of a sudden, he said, I can’t walk any more. So I leaned him against
the wall, and then I saw a hotel. I managed to get him to the hotel, drank water, then
we took a taxi back to the ho-hotel where we stayed, and called a doctor. And
doctor — and Anton was in pajama, laid on top of the bed. Couldn’t find peace,
couldn’t — couldn’t stay put in one position. And the doctor came, opened the hotel
do-door to the room, the door. And I had a gold — gold watch on, hundred dollar
watch. He said, oh, you have a beautiful watch on. I thought, uh-oh, that’s the
wrong doctor. I’m sure that be the wrong doctor. So he examined him. He said, I
give him a shot. He be okay in two hours. It was the worst thing he could have
done. In two hours he got up, he said — I said, I’m going to call your friend in
Yugoslavia, you talk to him. And I dialed the number, and he just — he just slumped
over. And I — I caught him real quick, and I was holding him, I — he probably
doesn’t know any more. He probably was already gone.
Q: And that’s how you lost him?
A: So then I— I wrote a nasty note to the doctor, I said, I’m gonna sue you.
Something is — something is wrong here. Then I went to here, and somebody, a

nurse, and I showed her what the doctor did. She said, that was the wrong thing to
do. He could have lived. He had a heart attack. He needed to be rushed to the
hospital.
Q: Oh dear.
A: So that’s how he died.
Q: What a bitter end.
A: And then they were so cruel. When he was laying in the bed, there were so many
people around him, I don’t know what, and I was way back. He had a big cross
here, a golden cross. They ripped that off and stole it. They stole that. I mean,
they’re awful. And then I couldn’t get the ashes, I had to wait seven months — six
months I had to wait for the ash-ashes. They said they were — that their crematorium
or the funeral parlor was bankrupt, or something. I got the ashes sitting here. I don’t
believe it’s his ashes. I don’t believe it. It’s just a tiny little thing, like that.
Q: Anton, had he been arrested? Why was he 1n concentration camps?
A: Why was he in concentration camps, that’s a good question. It has something to
do with Tito. Tito was after the students, I believe. I think the students were
revolting, many years ago. Do you know anything about it?
Q: So he was not ar — he was not arrested by the Nazis, he was arrested by the
communists?
