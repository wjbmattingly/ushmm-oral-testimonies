>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson and | am the host of the Museum’s public program, First
Person. Thank you for joining us. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our
First Person today is Mr. Gideon Frieder whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation. I'm pleased to let you know that Mr. Louis Smith is here with us today.

[Applause]

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share
with us their firsthand experiences associated with the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a
volunteer here at the Museum. Our program will continue until mid-August. The museum's
website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about our upcoming First Person guests and
will provide information about our program 2015. Anyone interested in keeping in touch with
the Museum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card that you'll find in your
program today or speak with a museum representative at the back of the theater when we
close the program today. In doing so you will receive an electronic copy of Gideon's biography
so that you can remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.

Gideon Frieder will share his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, there will be an opportunity
for you to ask Gideon some questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about

to hear from Gideon is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief
slide presentation to help with his introduction.

We begin with this childhood photograph of Gideon Frieder who was born
September 30, 1937. Gideon was born in Zvolen, Slovakia. On this map of Europe the arrow
points to Slovakia.

Here we see Gideon's father, Abraham Frieder. Gideon's father, a rabbi, was part
of the underground working group of the Slovak Jewry and was responsible for
communications with the Slovak authorities.

The photo on the left is of Gideon and his sister Gita. The photo on the right is of
Gideon's parents, Ruzena and Abraham, taken before the war.

In 1944, during the Slovak uprising against the Nazis, Gideon, his mother, and his
sister fled from Nove Mesto where they had been living since the beginning of the war. In
October they made their way northeast, the center of the uprising. Because of his connections
to the working group, Gideon's father fled separately.

On this map of Slovakia, the arrow points to the location. As the Nazis were
nearing Banska Bystrica, the family were caught in the mountains, caught in a massacre at
Stare Hory. Gideon ways taken to the village of Bully where he was placed in the home of
Paulina and Joseph Strycharszyk. This is a contemporary photograph of the home where
Gideon was hidden. He was later found by his father who survived the war.

Gideon lives in the Washington, D.C. area with his wife, Dalia, are having emigrated
from Israel to Buffalo, New York, in 1975 and then moving here to the Washington, D.C. area

in 1992. They have three children, a son Ophir, and two daughters, Tally and Gony, and four
grandchildren, including twins who are 4 years old. Their granddaughter, Gita, is named for
Gideon’s sister, whom we shall hear about in a short while.

Gideon is a physicist and computer scientist. He earned his doctorate in Quantum
Physics in Israel. Upon his retirement in 2010 as the A. James Clark Professor at the School
of Engineering and Applied Science at George Washington University, he was named the A.
James Clark Professor Emeritus of Engineering and Applied Science, the first time in the
history of the George Washington University that the Board of Trustees kept an endowed chair
title for an Emeritus Professor. He also previously served as the school’s dean.

Gideon has also taught and held dean and chairman positions at Syracuse
University, the University of Michigan, and the State University of New York at Buffalo. He
served in the Israeli Ministry of Defense in Research and Development and also served in the
Israeli Air Force. In addition to teaching, he has been a consultant with government agencies
and private companies, served as an expert witness in patent and copyright litigation and he
holds several patents.

Gideon’s son Ophir holds the title of Inaugural Robert L. McDewitt and Catherine H.
McDewitt Professorship, which is the highest endowed chair position in Georgetown
University. Ophir formerly served as the Chair of the Computer Sciences Department at
Georgetown University and is also a professor in the School of Medicine at Georgetown.

Gideon and his son, who also volunteers his time and expertise to the museum, are
collaborating on several computer projects concerning images. One of these projects is to aid

in the recognition of faded documents that was started four years ago in cooperation with a
German team from the University of Bremen. Their recent work in the German laboratory had
led to a breakthrough in the processing of faded documents which is now the subject of three
U.S. patents and one international patent. They hope to use this technology to improve the
usability of faded documents in this museum.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Gideon
Frieder.

[Applause]

Gideon, thank you so much for joining us and for your willingness to be our First
Person today. We have just an hour and you have so much to share with us so we'll jump right
In.

Although Germany overran Poland in September 1939 and soon dominated
Europe, your home country of Slovakia was allied with the Germans and, therefore, it was not
occupied by them until much later. Before we talk about the start of the war and the events
that led up to and following the German occupation of Slovakia start, first, by telling us a little
bit about your family and your community and your life in the pre-war years.
>> Gideon Frieder: There was not much in the pre-war. The war started in 1939. | was 2
years old. So! don't recall very much. The pre-war years that | recall were in Nove Mesto
where my father was a rabbi. He served for a while as a chief rabbi of part of the communities
in Slovakia.

| led a regular life. The only thing which was different is the fact that | knew that

certain streets | could not walk through because the children would throw rocks at me and call
me names, which | didn't understand really at the time. | do understand them today. Justa
regular childhood.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us -- your father was a remarkable man. Tell us more about him.
>> Gideon Frieder: |'m a bit biased about my father.
>> Bill Benson: Just a little bit but well-founded.
>> Gideon Frieder: I'll try to stick to things which can be documented.

My father was a very unusual man in the sense that prior to his education in what
we call Yeshiva, college, he finished a secular degree in a secular university. So he gota
degree in German literature and philosophy parallel to being ordained as a rabbi. He spoke
multiple languages. He wrote a diary, which was the reason | started to work on the
documents. He wrote a diary. The diary is written in six different languages. He died when he
was 36 years old. So he was really quite accomplished.

During the war, the Slovak Jewry did something which was not typical. They get
various factions together and they created a working group; which was headed by a woman,
by the way. And that working group was the underground government of the Slovak Jewry.
And he's credited in saving thousands of life.

In my home, you would see one of the documents which was created by donations
when my father's remains were moved from Slovakia to Israel. 1,010 trees were planted by
those survivors which he saved.
>> Bill Benson: That he had saved.

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Gideon Frieder: The second time it has happened. About 1,000 trees were planted by the
survivors when he died in 1946.

So he was a remarkable man. His diary was used as a major documentary
evidence in the trials of Eichmann, who was the German responsible for murdering thousands
if not tens of thousands of Jews. It's still a unique historical document. Among other things,
one of the first testimonies of what happened in Auschwitz. It's documented in those diaries.
Some people fled and he had the opportunity to talk to them.
>> Bill Benson: Gideon, you were, of course, very young when your mother was murdered.
We'll hear more about that in a little bit. Do you know much about your mother that you can
share with us about her?
>> Gideon Frieder: Not really very much. | was 7 years old when she died.
>> Bill Benson: Right.
>> Gideon Frieder: Many of the things | know came to my attention by reading the diaries. I'm
comfortable in four of the languages of the diaries.
>> Bill Benson: Four of the six.
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes. So! had no difficulty reading the diary. So part of the information is
from there. Part of the information is stories that | heard from others.

One story -- let me tell you something about myself. I'm the only scientist in the
world which has an article in a cookbook.

[Laughter]
Really. True story. There's a cookbook. | think you may even get it in the bookstore. The
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .
cookbook called "Holocaust Survivor Cookbook." Many Holocaust survivor contributed
recipes. | love to cook. | think it's very creative. So | contributed the recipe. And when you
contributed a recipe, a story had to be added. And one of the stories, the story on my page, is
about my father, my mother, which was offered by her Christian neighbors, to get the chicken
for her children. During the war it was an unusual thing. She refused as the chicken was not
kosher. So if | go theoretically by Jewish law she could have done it. She didn't because she
was that religious.

So | have another story like that, but for everything else she was just my mother.
There's a story about her. Well, | can tell stories all the time. Why don't you ask questions.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us, of course, the war really did not come to Slovakia until 1944 and it
began elsewhere in Europe in September 1939. During that lengthy period of almost five
years, tell us what you can about what life was like for your father and your community during
that period when the full brunt of the war is happening elsewhere.
>> Gideon Frieder: It's true that the war proper didn't come to Slovakia until 1944 triggered by
the uprising against the fascist government of Slovakia. But it doesn't mean that the Jews
were not discriminated. As a matter of fact, in 1942 there was a huge wave of deportation of
Slovak Jews. They were one of the first to be deported to Auschwitz. And Auschwitz was one
of the first death camps. It was both a labor camp and a death camp. The
Slovakian-Hungarian Jewry were the first to be deported there after the enactment of
anti-Jewish legislation by the Slovaks.
We associate the Holocaust with the Germans. The Slovak anti-Jewish legislation
ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,
was harsher than the German Nuremberg Laws. And that was enacted before 1942. In 1942
there was a census of the Jews specifically created to get enough information to be able to
deport the Jews.

That story is really something that is not very well-known and should be told. The
Slovak government paid, the Slovak government paid, to the Germans for every Jew they took
and killed. So the Slovak government paid for another country to kill its own citizens just
because they were Jewish.
>> Bill Benson: If | remember correctly from what you told me, the money that they paid
Germany had been taken from Jews.
>> Gideon Frieder: Right. There was something called Aryanization. That was the
confiscation of the Jewish property.

The reason | Know about it, by the way -- it's an interesting story. | didn't know
about it. So one day a German economist comes to the museum here, a young man who was
interested in the economy of the funding of the Second World War by Germany. He was
interested how come a relatively small country could fight the whole world and fund it. And he
was interested in the economics of it. And he came to the archives and said: There is
knowledge that the Slovaks paid the Germans; that was part of the funding to kill the Jews and
| want to find the document and you have the document somewhere because the Museum got
from the Slovak government, from the Czech-Slovak government, copies of all the archives of
the fascist government, archives relating to the Jewish question, quote/unquote.

Let’s not be overwhelmed by the generosity. The Museum paid $1 for every page

they provided so it's not done from pure Christian love. Or Jewish love, for that matter.

[Laughter]

I'm part of the Georgetown University now. The credo that we subscribed to the
Judeo-Christian values. So | mixed the two.

So he told me there has to be a document somewhere that | can use in my
research to substantiate it. Now, the documents which we have are one after another. They
are not organized. They were given to us out of boxes. They're not organized by subject. And
they're microfilmed; so | painfully went over the microfilms. He had an idea what period it may
be. And | actually found the document. And the document is very, very formal that according
to the government, the agreement between Germany and Slovakia, paragraph so-and-so, we
ask you transfer so much money funded by this particular budgetary item. So we followed the
budgetary item to find what it is. And it's the confiscation of the Jewish property.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned, Gideon, the census that was taken. Tell us what was
significant about that census of Jews that was taken.
>> Gideon Frieder: In 1942, the Slovak government did a census of the Jews, divided into
groups by age, by profession, by gender. And it was a very, very detailed description of the
Jewry. When we got these documents, | was asked by the Museum to find the census, to go
over it.

You see, | had a unique position in the volunteer group of the museum. | was
absolutely the best Slovak speaker in the museum for the simple reason | was the only one.
[Laughter]

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

So | went over it. | found among other things that -- the page describing myself, describing my
family. And in the collection, it was done by cities, by small cities. In some cases there were
no Jews in the small city. And in some cases there was a document. “In some cases”? Many
cases. There was a document saying, "We are proud to tell you that there are no Jews in this
municipality and we intend to keep it that way."

So it was a sobering experience to go over the census. It was very well done. It
was used to identify the Jews for the deportation.
>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to the uprising and then all the terror that happened after that
for you, your father, as you said, was very engaged in rescue efforts. Working under a very
anti-Semitic government with those very harsh laws, as you mentioned, you told me that you
were somewhat protected from the full brunt of that by your father.
>> Gideon Frieder: We were essentially very protected. He was a protected person. He was
kind of the Secretary of State of that group. He spoke fluently German, Slovak, and
Hungarian, so he could deal with the Germans, deal with the Slovaks. He spoke Latin. He
could deal with the upper clergy. Slovakia is mostly Catholic country. Even today 85% are
Catholic. He had a very good relationship with the Catholic clergy, which was kind of
interesting because the priests -- the president of the country who enacted all of these laws
was a Catholic priest.

By the way, after the Second World War, he was tried and executed as a war
criminal, one of the very few men of cloth which was prosecuted and found guilty.

SO we were very much protected from it. And that protection prevailed essentially

until 1944. It did not prevent, by the way, the Germans to deport his parents, my father's
parents, my grandparents. They were taken to Auschwitz and killed immediately because they
were old. They were of no use for them as workers. Did not protect the family at all.
>> Bill Benson: | was going to ask you next that very question. Did you lose family members
during that period? And obviously you did.
>> Gideon Frieder: | lost almost all my family during that period.
>> Bill Benson: You had told me an anecdote or a story that there was one prominent official
in the Slovak government that really was in your father's debt which may have helped to
protect him a little bit.
>> Gideon Frieder: Right. So, part of the protection of my father -- part of the reason he was
so protected, not only because he was a functionary representing the Jewry and could talk to
them, but there was a particular member of the Slovak government which wanted to be known
for his scholarly achievements. So my father wrote for him a Doctoral dissertation. And the
guy got a Doctorate on my father's dissertation. And there's a certain psychological tie
between your advisor and yourself. It doesn't matter how you may hate him or not.

So each time there was a need for some consultation on, quote, academic affairs,
my father was summoned. And it's often this guy who was responsible for the Jews was
summoned from his room while my father was there and used the time to kind of rummage
through the documents and find out what is really happening. So that helped a lot.

The details, you see, | didn't know from my own knowledge. It's all part of the
diaries. They are well documented. The diaries -- there was a book written by my uncle based

on the diaries. It was written in Hebrew, eventually translated to English. It was available. It's
now out of print. But if any of you want a copy of it, just send me an e-mail. I'll send you an
electronic copy. That's written in English. Half of it is based on the diaries, very abbreviated,
obviously, and half of it is based on what my uncle did after my father died. He took his
position as the head of Jewry and was in the position until he emigrated to Israel.
>> Bill Benson: You are going to get an e-mail from me about that.
>> Gideon Frieder: | have to tell you, | check my e-mail once a year.
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Which begins tomorrow, | hope. The Slovak National Uprising occurred in
August 1944, and it had an immediate effect on you and your family.
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what the uprising was and then what its effect was on you in the days
and weeks that followed.
>> Gideon Frieder: Well, you know, when there is a war, the bad thing is to be on the side of
the losers. The Slovaks decided to be on the side of the non-losers. There was an opposition
to the fascist government, a unique one because it was one of the unique times in history that
Western support partisans by the Western ally and Communist support partisans by the Soviet
Union cooperated, essentially cooperated and created an uprising against the fascist
government.
As you look at the map of Slovakia, if Slovakia is taken away from the German
self-influence, it shuts the capability from the south to get into Germany. So anybody who

looks at the map and has any military understanding would understand the Germans had to
cross that uprising. And they invaded. They invaded. The force was mainly Waffen SS, which
was the fighting unit of the SS. And they had both German and Ukrainian part of the German
Army, of the Waffen SS. Ukrainian SS members. And they invaded. Obviously it was very
clear that this is the end of any protection, end of everything. The Germans are here. And the
Ukrainians are here, which were far more cruel than the Germans ever were, at least from my
perspective as a child. I'm nota historian. These are my perspectives.
>> Bill Benson: So the Germans invade.
>> Gideon Frieder: The Germans invaded. It was very clear that we are done.

My father was very well-known. It was clear that the Germans really didn't know
what the Miranda rights are. They would see him, shoot him, and that's it. So he decided that
he cannot stay with us because if he is found, by association he will be killed. So he sent us,
us meaning my mother, my sister and me, from the city. But the city was already under siege.
Nove Mesto was the city. So he puts us in an ambulance and sent the ambulance toward the
German lines. Nobody would suspect an ambulance towards the German lines would have
any Jews in it. Once the ambulance was out of the city, obviously we turned around. We fled.
The ambulance broke down. A long story. Eventually we had to move on foot. We move on
foot for a period that's unknown to me. | don't know if it was days or weeks. More than days. |
know we slept on the way in various huts, shepherd huts in the mountains.

For me as a child, it was a great adventure.

sheep and communicate with shepherds. It was great fun. Not for my mother, | assume.
Eventually we got to Banska Bystrica.

By the way, it's “Bystrica,” not “Bystrica.” [pronunciation distinction]
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Gideon Frieder: That's ok.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to work on that.
>> Gideon Frieder: That's what you told me previously.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: It's a work in progress.

[Laughter]
>> Gideon Frieder: Why should he work on that? If | can speak English with my accent, you
can speak Slovak in your accent.
>> Bill Benson: Good point. Good point.

[Laughter]
>> Gideon Frieder: Oh. So! don't have an accent, by the way. We were on vacation in
Virginia Beach once, in the summer. And this young woman, high school kid, listened to my
wife and myself speaking English. When we are in company, we speak English because
impolite to speak any other language. And the young woman, high school kid, waitress, listens
to us and says, "What a wonderful Yankee accent you have."

[Laughter]

So | have a Yankee accent.
>> Bill Benson: So | will call it Banska.
>> Gideon Frieder: Bystrica.
>> Bill Benson: Why was that your destination?
>> Gideon Frieder: That was the center of the uprising. The whole area was under total
control of the partisans, the Russian supporters.
>> Bill Benson: Working together.
>> Gideon Frieder: Working together as a group. There was a large contingency of Jewish
partisans. That was the place to go. That was a safe haven. And we congregated there; lots
of people congregated, Jews and non-Jews, everybody fleeing from the Germans who were
coming from the south.

The southern part of Slovakia is a plain. And that's where most of the agriculture
was. That was the breadbasket of Slovakia. The northern parts is mountainous. The
partisans congregated in the mountains. Banska Bystrica is on the foot of the mountains.
So we went there. My mother was identified as the wife of Rabbi Frieder. She was very well
accepted by the community, taken care of. And we stayed there until the German armored
force, the Waffen SS in the armor brigades, came to about 15 kilometers south of Banska
Bystrica. It was a question of a day or two, 15 kilometers.
>> Bill Benson: Which was before the Germans arrived just outside of the city. Was there a
period where it was really felt that that was a safe haven?
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes. Yes. Remember, this was 1944, October. The war was over in

some sense. It was after the invasion of Normandy. It was under the big offensive of the
Soviet Union. The Soviets were now in Poland, on the northern border of Slovakia. They were
behind the mountains. They could have gotten in and supported the partisans within a couple
of days. The Soviets, for their own reason, let the Slovaks bleed to death.
>> Bill Benson: So they could have come in.
>> Gideon Frieder: They could have saved Slovakia. They did not. They were sitting behind
the mountains waiting for the Slovaks to take the brunt. It's a very disputed point of history. As
| told you, I'm not a historian but these are the facts. The fact is they could have come. They
didn't. And the Slovak partisans, especially the Russian-supported ones, 100% sure, | assume
that here they are behind the mountains; what's the big deal?
>> Bill Benson: Our benefactors, our friends are going to come in.
>> Gideon Frieder: Over there, they just defeated -- there was this huge defeat of the German
armies of the Eastern front. What's the problem?

So everybody felt that's it. Anyway, they would not come to the mountains. They
now have their safe passage to Germany, through the Slovakia plains and through Moravia.
But it didn't happen. They wanted to crush the rebellion. And they started to come -- there
was a big panic, a big panic to the point that | as a child seen that everybody was running
around.
>> Bill Benson: You felt the panic yourself.
>> Gideon Frieder: Everybody. It was visible. People were running. People were shouting.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that, did your mother know where your father was at

that point?
>> Gideon Frieder: No. No. No.
>> Bill Benson: He put you in the ambulance. As far as you knew, he was gone.
>> Gideon Frieder: He was gone. Nobody knew. Nobody knew where he is. You know, it
was a war. So when we were there, my mother befriended this guy, Henry Herzog. His
Hebrew name was Adam.

My grandson is called Adam after Henry who passed away several years ago, well
before Adam was born.

So she befriended him. Then there was in this panic. Everybody wanted to leave.
Adam is a partisan, his unit together were to leave and go to the mountains to keep on fighting.
She asked him to take us with him, which he refused. He was part of the fighting unit. But
eventually she prevailed. He did take us with them. We went on foot to the north through this
mountain passage from Banska Bystrica to the mountains.
>> Bill Benson: So in Banska Bystrica, you have a combination of fighters, the partisans but
also civilians, women and children.
>> Gideon Frieder: Many civilians, women and children; most of them non-Jewish, obviously.
The Slovaks, which were not associated with the fascist, fled. In a war situation, if you are
Jewish or not, if you are caught, you are killed.
>> Bill Benson: So the partisans, of course, as fighting units for the most part aren't taking the
women and children with them but your mother --
>> Gideon Frieder: They were not taking women and children. The women and children were

were breaking down and running out of fuel. And we were attacked in Stare Hory with a
clearly highly trained Army, the Germans. And they did what every highly trained Army would
do. They bombed the exit. They bombed the entrance. They caught us in the middle.

There was a road. That was it. There was mountains on one side. There was a dirt road.

passage.
>> Bill Benson: You were attacked by planes?
>> Gideon Frieder: We were attacked by planes. There was an actual massacre. There was
no place to flee. We fled running up the mountains. And on the edge of the forest we were hit.

| was very lucky. In Europe, at the time, children, boys, didn't wear long pants.

That was a sign of maturity. You got long pants when you were immature. When you were
young, you wear shorts. But it was very cold. So children in Europe at the time, boys and
girls, wore thick woolen stockings held by garters. Boys and girls. Doesn't matter. And | wore
these thick woolen stockings. And when | was hit exactly here, when | was hit, | was lucky: no
major artery was severed; no bone shattered; no major nerve severed. But the blood gushed

Henry was fleeing as well. His story is amazing in itself. His story is chronicled in a
book which | have to publish about his life. The name of the book, which | selected, was

>> Bill Benson: "Heaven Did Not Cry."

by several bullets and fell on him. He tumbled into the ground under the body of this partisan

>> Gideon Frieder: 3 years old. She was 3 years old.
>> Bill Benson: What did Henry --
>> Gideon Frieder: Henry took me and said, "I'll bring your mother later." And here was an
amazing thing happened in substance. His book chronicled the time | was with them with the
partisans in the mountains. In his book it is very clear that | was in the mountain with them for
seven days. And so he carried me on his back. | don't remember that time. It didn't exist. In
my mind | was taken from the massacre and put in this village of Bully. | have no recollection
whatsoever of those seven days. The only reason | know is the book. | met him after the war.
He told me about it. It just doesn't exist.

So he took me -- the partisans decided that the 7-year-old boy -- they didn't know
that | am wounded, by the way. Everybody was covered with blood. The showers were not
existing, obviously, not in the mountains. Everybody was covered in blood. This bandage --
>> Bill Benson: Had really sealed the wound.
>> Gideon Frieder: Had really sealed the wound. There was no further bleeding. | was
carried on the back not because of the wound but because --
>> Bill Benson: Keep up with the partisans.
>> Gideon Frieder: Keep up. I'm not sure that he was the only one who carried me.
>> Bill Benson: So he can't continue --
>> Gideon Frieder: So he can't continue to keep me. So they come to a very small village. |
would not even say it was a village. It was a small hamlet, 40, 50 little hutches next to a dirt
road. They watched it. They seen there was no German or Ukrainian garrisons. And they

>> Gideon Frieder: They didn't know anybody. It was the first building. | was there -- not after
the war. | was there the first time in 1990-something. | couldn't go before. He brought me
there. And here a story divulges as well.

Learning from his book, what he writes in the book, these partisans were not clean
shaven. They lived in the mountains. They had these German-acquired weaponry, hand
grenades hanging over them. They had to be a very fearsome looking set of individuals. They
come to the building. They tell the people -- this is Henry's story.
>> Bill Benson: The one he tells in his book.
>> Gideon Frieder: The one he tells in his book, not my recollection. He tells the people that
I'm a Jewish boy, that I'm a son of a very prominent person, and that they put me in their care
and if they don't want to take me in their care they will kill them. Not very much choice, is
there? That's his story. Makes sense.

From my point of view -- | was outside when they talked. From my point of view,
they brought me in. And all | recollect is total love, warm care. Incredible, the difference
between my recollection and what he said. Maybe they were threatened, but they didn't do it
because they were threatened. | have proof to these things. This is not the time to discuss it,
but | have proof that they really did it from what they considered Christian love. Very, very,
very devout Catholics.
>> Bill Benson: And very poor. Right?

>> Gideon Frieder: Very poor. Dirt poor. All the village was poor. The hut was a typical
mountain hut: huge central stove. On one side of the stove one room. On the other side of
the stove another room. The stove protruding into both rooms for heat. Myself and the brother
of the woman lived in one room. The husband and wife lived in the other. And all | remember
is care. They shaved food from their own mouth to feed me. | was always hungry. Because
everybody was. But! was never starved. And there's a difference. Because they fed me.
They didn't have an abundance of food. And they cared for me. They discovered | am
wounded. They found -- that little hamlet of 40, 50 houses saved 10 Jews. One of them was
an ophthalmologist. And he was summoned by them to care for my wounds. You know, close
to doctor as it is.
>> Bill Benson: So in a little hamlet like this with just, as you said, maybe 40, 50 houses,
obviously to the community the fact that you were there or others couldn't have been a secret.
>> Gideon Frieder: Couldn't have been a secret. So my cover story was that | was the son of
the brother of the woman. And the brother of the woman was killed by the partisans. Why?
Because it would give me a certain credentials. If my father was killed by the partisans,
obviously | am not on the partisan side and clearly | cannot be Jewish. And they gave me a
Slovak name. | was not called Gideon Frieder. They gave me the name Jan Suche. Looking
back it's very interesting. Jan is the Slovak version of John, a very Christian name. And
Suche in Slovak means dry.
>> Bill Benson: Dry.
>> Gideon Frieder: Dry. Not wet, dry. Just the opposite what | was. When | was brought

there, | was wet, hungry. | was a mess. But Suche is a very typical Slovak name. It's not like
Smith, not like Brown.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: And that became for those roughly six months --
>> Gideon Frieder: Jan Suche. But they knew that the others are Jews.
>> Bill Benson: Right, within that community.
>> Gideon Frieder: Within the community. Think about it. 10 different people. And it was
dangerous. In the hut next to the hut | lived the Germans once came and found a partisan in
the hut. They locked the hut and burned the hut with the people, with the partisan, next to my
house.
>> Bill Benson: And the people lived in the hut.
>> Gideon Frieder: Well, they were dead after they were burned.
>> Bill Benson: That's what | mean. But --
>> Gideon Frieder: They lived in the hut. Yes. And that -- by the way, that building is still
there. The remnants, the burned remnants of the building, is still there to this day with a
plaque commemorating.
>> Bill Benson: So the incredible danger to the family.
>> Gideon Frieder: Incredible danger. It was a danger of life. It was not something that they
would be slapped on the hand. They would be executed.
>> Bill Benson: You said to me once that the Germans ruled by day, the partisans by night.
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes. It was a small hamlet. It was the end of the war. There was not very

large German presence. After the SS conquered all of it, the Waffen SS, they were not
replaced but they were supplemented by a German garrison of old men because all the young
were killed. And that hamlet was not big enough or not strategically important enough to have
a garrison there. It was in the middle of the way from nowhere to nowhere. So they would
patrol during the day just to see that everything's available. And during the night, its partisans
would come down from the mountains to be in a warm hut. They would go and sleep in the
attic or sleep on the floor. The poor villagers by the day were dominated by the Germans, by
the night were robbed by the partisans. They had to do it. They didn't have an easy life. But
they survived somehow.
>> Bill Benson: And that continued for you until May 1945 when the war ended.
>> Gideon Frieder: Continued until April 1945 because the -- a Romanian contingent fighting
as part of the Soviet Red Army liberated that part. For many Slovaks the word "liberated" is
very much in dispute. For many Slovaks they replaced the German occupation with a Russian
occupation. But it's something to discuss in a very different context. But for everybody, the
Germans were gone. The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by American Army
led by General Patton. The eastern part was liberated by the Soviet, by the Red Army. And
they came in April.
>> Bill Benson: So you're under the Soviet now.
>> Gideon Frieder: | didn't know that, obviously.
>> Bill Benson: Right. Right. Right.
>> Gideon Frieder: And they wore different uniforms. Suddenly people are smiling. Nobody's

robbing. The Slovaks were robbed by the Soviets. There are even songs that children like me
sang about the difference. A song which says, “The Germans are away. The Russian came
and they took our watches.” Children's song. That's another part of the story.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about -- in the time we have left, tell us about reunification with your
father, how you were able to do that.
>> Gideon Frieder: What happened is Adam, Henry Herzog, when he met any Jewish partisan
or any Jew anyplace, told them that you should know that the wife of Rabbi Frieder was killed,
her daughter was killed, but her son survived and he is in the village of Bully. The name of the
village, Bully. And he spread the rumor.

My father, who had a flowing beard, as you had seen in the picture, shaved his
beard when the Germans occupied. So he was not recognized. And at one point in time he
was put in jail by the Slovaks but not recognized as who he is. And in the jail there was
another guy and he told him, "Did you hear what happened?"
>> Bill Benson: Said this to your father.
>> Gideon Frieder: To my father. So he heard about it without identifying himself at all, even
before the end of the war. Toward the end of the war, he fled from the jail aided by a
sympathetic guard. And he found refuge in a Franciscan monastery. The Franciscan knew
about him, recognized him, and gave him shelter. That was already 1945. It was clear who
was winning. They gave him shelter and he stayed there knowing well where | am. After the
war he sent emissaries to pick me up. And in this April they came and took me back. So |
reunited with him in April 1945. He died in June 1946.

>> Bill Benson: Just a year later.
>> Gideon Frieder: Just a year later.
>> Bill Benson: And you were at that point 9 | think.
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: That had to be just unbelievably crushing to you after all you had been
through.
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes. What can | say? How crushing it is is very difficult to explain. But let
me tell you one thing. | don't think | shared it with you.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Gideon Frieder: After the war there was an epidemic of marriages not only in Europe, the
baby boom in this country. People tried to recoup, tried to get back to life. My father was
settled with a young child, myself. He was, again, very active. He was the head of the Slovak
Jewry. The part of the Slovak Jewry which was -- was Orthodox but not very Orthodox. It was
most of the community. It was very busy. He was dealing with recreating Jewish life,
recreating people. He brought me times to get moneys for all of these people who are coming,
Jews and non-Jews, who were coming from concentration camps. So he needed somebody.
He re-married a woman which lost her husband. Before he died, he swore her to take me out
of the bloody continent, quote, and take me to Israel. And that's what she did. | was then 10
years old.
>> Bill Benson: When you moved to Israel.
>> Gideon Frieder: Straight to another war.

>> Bill Benson: Straight to another war.
>> Gideon Frieder: So that was 10 years. Till | was 16, | cried every night. Not only after |
came to Israel. | cried every night until | was 16. And if you ask me why, | couldn't tell you.
And | -- my mother -- my step-mother asked me why. | couldn't tell her. There were no
nightmares. There were no dreams. | just got up crying. That's what crushing means.
>> Bill Benson: Do you mind if | read just a tiny little excerpt from your father's diary?
>> Gideon Frieder: This is a free country.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Ok. In the book that was based on your father's diary, he wrote about you.
Quote, He told stories of partisans who roamed the mountains and of Jews and the Russian
and Romanian armies. He talked about Russian and German soldiers who fell prisoners.
Gideon also talked about his mother and sister without fully comprehending the meaning of
their death. Such expressions as killing and death had become commonplace concepts for
him and he used them with great naturalness, bitter experience hardened him.
>> Gideon Frieder: Well, it's correct. Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: How did your father's diary survive?
>> Gideon Frieder: Part of it was written after the war. The part which was written -- the
framework was written after the work. The diaries themself were saved -- not only the diaries,
the whole huge library that we had in Nove Mesto were taken by the Franciscan monks and
transported from our house into the monastery and kept by them the whole war, including the
diaries, including every scrap of paper. They kept it. And after the war they returned it. And

part of the diary -- part of the library we took when we moved to Israel and sold it to be able to
survive. Most of the books. Some of the books | have, including a book in 1736.
>> Bill Benson: That was part of his collection.
>> Gideon Frieder: That was part of his collection, including the Bible. He noted my birth and
the birth of my sister. Some of the documents | recovered only two months ago.
>> Bill Benson: Two months ago?
>> Gideon Frieder: Two months ago. My uncle died several years ago, many years ago, in
Israel. He left a house. My cousins eventually decided -- one of my cousins occupied the
house. My cousins eventually decided to sell the house so that a high-rise could be built there.
And in doing so they had to go over all the possessions in the house. And they found original
documents from my father, from the '20s and '30s of the previous century. I'm going to donate
them to the museum here. The diaries themselves are in Jerusalem. These documents |
cannot just move there. | would like to move them there so everything in one place. Cannot
be done. So | just talked here a couple of months ago. And today -- we are going to bring
them here and preserve them. So there will be an historical record kept. These are valuable
documents.
>> Bill Benson: Just came to your attention --
>> Gideon Frieder: Just came to my attention a couple of months ago.
>> Bill Benson: We're going to close the program in just a moment. Obviously you didn't get a
chance to ask Gideon questions and there's much more that we weren't able to hear about.
We could have used the rest of the afternoon and tomorrow. But we want to express our

hope that you'll come back to a First Person program another time. The Museum's website will
have information about First Person for 2015. So if you're back in Washington, D.C. or if you
live locally, please join us again.

I'm going to turn back to Gideon to close our program in a moment. It's our tradition
at First Person that our First Person has the last word. So he will have the last word but before
he does, just a couple of things. Because we didn't have a chance for you to ask him
questions -- Gideon, you're willing to stay behind for a little while?
>> Gideon Frieder: Yes. | have a commitment tomorrow at 11:00.

[Laughter]

So till then. | can stay.

>> Bill Benson: There you have it. When Gideon's finished, he'll step down off the stage over
here to our right. So, please, absolutely feel free to just come up and say hi, ask a question,
have your picture taken with him, whatever you want to do. Please feel free to do that.

When Gideon's done, I'm going to also, at the end, ask you all to stand. And our
photographer, Joel, will come up on the stage and take a photo of Gideon with you as the
backdrop. It just makes a tremendous portrait.

As | said, it's our tradition our First Person has the last word. On that note, I'd like
to turn to Gideon to close today's program.
>> Gideon Frieder: This is not what | usually say at the end of First Person. It will not be
something to you that you will like to hear, but | have you as a captive audience.

Synagogues were burned. Jews were beaten on the street, their businesses
burned. And, no, I'm not talking about the Holocaust. | am talking about something which
happened two years -- two days ago in Paris. If you ask if there will be another Holocaust, you
don't have to go farther except the Holocaust of the 21st Century, which already started, will
make the Holocaust of the previous century as a little flame relative to a bomb fire. Think
about it when you leave here. It may not affect me. | will be dead. It may not affect you. But
it will affect your children and grandchildren. We are today in the same place that the world
was in 1932. When businesses are burned and people are beaten, the world is silent. The
world doesn't do anything. Oh, maybe they say something, but they don't do anything. Exactly
what happened in the 30s of the previous century which brought in the Holocaust of the 20th
Century.

When one of our most beloved presidents, President Kennedy, was quoted to say
the hottest places in hell are reserved for those which in time of need kept their quiet, don't you
reserve your places there. Act, be cognizant so that the fate -- so that the fate that befelled me
will not happen to your children.

Thank you.
