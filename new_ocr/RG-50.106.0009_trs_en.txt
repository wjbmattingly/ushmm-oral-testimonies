five girls in the same school, because we had girls' schools and boys' schools. It was not
mixed schools. And the -- my principal, when we were arrested, came every single day
to see if there were news from us. So it was no problem at all.

class neighborhood?
A: Probably middle class, I would say.
Q: Uh-huh. Did you live in a house or an apartment?

Paris.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 9
A: August 1941. And at that time, he was arrested by a SS and a French gendarme.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: In 1942, when we were arrested, it was only French gendarme who came. I think we
were denounced, I'm sure, because we -- my art teacher had a home outside of Paris, and
she says, Go and stay as long as you want. But it became dangerous to stay there too, so
we came home. And my mother said, We can't stay there all the time; we have to do
something, go to work or find —
And that same day -- we came back on a Sunday. And on Monday, they came to arrest
my older sister, me, and my other sisters. At night, they came to take the whole family.
Because the other ones were in school. My other sisters and brothers were all still in
school. My little brother was too small. He was home.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Was two and a half years old.
Q: When the Germans first came in, how did your life change?
A: Well, we had the curfews. We couldn't get out at certain times. We had to stay in
line for food. It was not easy. It was very difficult. Especially here, eight people
to -- or nine people to feed. It's --
Q: Could you go to school?
A: No. My oldest sister and I and my other sister could not go to school.
Q: School was closed immediately?
A: Yes.
Q: So what did you do with your time? You were --
A: Working.
Q: -- a young girl.
A: I worked. I did everything I could find as work.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 10
Q: You worked with your father?
A: My father was arrested already at that time.
Q: Oh.
A: In 1941. And they came in in 1940. It didn't take them long to arrest them.
Q: What happened to your father's business?
A: Oh, they took over. And they never wanted to take it -- give it back, especially to
me.
Q: Do you remember your parents talking? Did they share their knowledge with you?
You were 15 years old then.
A: Uh-huh.
Q: Do you remember them speaking to you?
A: Yes. My father told me, Now you the head of the family, you have to provide for
them. And my mother said, But she's a young child. But we didit. I managed.
My oldest sister was in medical school and she was very seldom home. Her professor
was very nice and he sneaked her in as much as he could. So there was some good ones
and some very bad ones, French people; not that I liked them very much.
Q: And what was the food situation like?
A: Well, we weren't too hungry a lots of time. I -- our friends who were not Jewish
brought some food to us. We stayed in line for milk and eggs for the little one. And we
saved a lot of stamps and things to keep her and send to my father, because my father was
already at Drancy at that time.
Q: Were your home -- were you home when your father was taken away”?
A: Yes.
Q: What was that like? Can you describe?

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 11
A: It wasahorror. It was horrible. He was walking out of the house going to work
and the SS and the French gendarme asked him, Are you Mr. Zosnika? And he said,
Yes. And he said, Take a blanket. And they took him away.
In the meantime, he said to me, You have to go here and there. They owe me money,
you take -- but people, you know, everybody works for them self. And that's what
happened.
I had a holder of -- I loved my father very much. And my mother used to say the world
turned over if my father was taken away. I was -- I became a different person, a very sad
person.
Q: Uh-huh. So you stayed at home with your mother? You were --
A: Oh, yes.
Q: -- second in line, so you --
A: Yeah.
Q: And your sister was away.
And then for the next few months?
A: I worked, I --
Q: What kind of work did you do?
A: Oh, anything I could find. Pressing heavy men's clothing, come back with things
like that. My art teacher give me some work to do. I did that, some commercial art.
Anything I could do. Keeping a child or, you know, being -- taking care of children.
And --
Q: What was your mother's state of mind at that point?
A: Well, my mother was completely gone at that point. She adored her husband. And
after her seven children, she didn't have any strength at all. She -- was a time, I
remember her at that period of time, she was in bed.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 12
Q: So the responsibility was really on your shoulders?
A: On my shoulder and my little sister Bruna. We both really worked very hard to
bring in food. A rabbit, if we could find. We didn't care what it was, as long as they
weren't hungry.
Q: How was your health at that time?
A: It was fine.
Q: Still --
A: Iwas young. I was a--
Q: Uh-huh. And then what was the next change?
A: The next change, somebody came over and said, Go away because tomorrow is going
to be a hot -- they're going to pick up the children and the women. And that was the
famous July 4th. So we went away to that house, one of -- one of my teacher's, and we
stayed three months. And by the time we came back --
Q: The whole -- your whole -- your mother and the children?
A: Yes, the children.
And by the time we came back on the Sunday, the Monday, they came to pick us up. I
remember I picked up my sister at the hospital, and then we stopped at the library to buy
books. And we were reading upstairs and my mother said the bandagen (phonetic),
They are here. That means the gendarme were here to pick us up, the three of us.
But we had time to -- you know, in France, you don't have closet, but you have armoire,
so we pulled one armoire and we put my little sister in the back so they just took the two
of us, my older sister and me. But at night, they came to pick everybody up.
Q: But they took -- picked you -- the two of you up first?
A: First.
Q: And what happened to you? What -- what --

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 13
A: They took us to where police station and put us 1n the -- in the toilets for the whole
night.
Q: The two of you together?
A: Yeah.
Q: Were there other people with you?
A: No.
Q: And then you spent the night?
A: Then in the morning, they said, Come on and you're going to join the rest of the
family. They took us in the truck and they put us in Drancy.
Q: Then the next day, they picked up the rest of your family?
A: Yeah.
Q: And you were all together then?
A: Yeah. In Drancy, yes, we were all together. We stayed three months there. And
February --
Q: Let's talk a little bit about the conditions there. What was it like during those three
months? How did you sleep? What were the sleeping conditions like there?
A: It was -- everybody was sleeping in one room. It used to be a caserne for soldiers,
so there was bathrooms and there was showers and, you know, they have the beds one to
the other. Food, it wasn't that much, but we -- I guess we were hungry, but the hunger
goes away.
And three months later --
Q: How much belong -- how many belongings were you able to bring from home or was
your mother able to bring?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 14
A: Just the precious things, they told us to take; the jewelry, the coats, the fur coats,
the -- all what they could use it and they could sell it or give it away or -- that's what it all
is. Anda blanket. Anda blanket. Which was taken away in the train anyway.
Q: Were there friends of yours and neighbors there also that you recognized?
A: Oh, they were all looking outside and they were smiling.
Q: This is when you were taken away?
A: Uh-huh.
Q: Your non-Jewish neighbors --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- were smiling as you were being taken away?
A: Yeah.
Q: How did you feel, as a young -- young woman, when you saw that?
A: Not good. Not really -- I hear -- maybe I'm wrong, but I never had hatred for
anybody, because I felt that if I hate too much, it will destroy me. And I didn't want to
be destroyed. I wanted to fight. So I did not look at them. And whatever they did, I
did not care.
Q: When you were in Drancy now, your Jewish friends or your Jewish neighbors, were
they with you also? Did you know any other people when you were there --
A: Yes, but --
Q: -- from before?
A: Yeah. Yes, I think so. Quite a few -- not many.
Because we had a problem. We were seven children. And to run away with seven
children was impossible. Nobody would take us. So the people who only had one
child, two children, they were able to cross the border or go to the -- on the other side of
France, the ligne de demarcation; go to Switzerland; go to Spain. Spain accepted them.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 15
And from Spain, they used to go to Portugal. And from Portugal to America or Canada
or Mexico.
But with seven children and one two and a half years old, forget it, nobody wanted to
take us, so we end up --
Q: You were there for three months?
A: Uh-huh.
Q: And what did you do during the day?
A: Nothing.
Q: Just sit around?
A: Uh-huh.
Q: And everybody just sat there?
A: Nobody there was doing nothing. Just sit around waiting.
Q: Uh-huh. And then the next thing that happened?
A: Next thing that happened, that the train that -- we knew already that we're going to be
deported.
Q: How did you know that?
A: Because the trains were coming in one after the other.
Q: Did you know where they were going?
A: No, we did not know where. They were saying that we were going to work in the
commune and we'll be very -- very happy.
This was the worst tragedy happened to me is, being eight people, we had to be five by
five. I was holding my little brother's milk and I was separated from my mother and my
sisters and my brothers. And three -- we were three together. And the different -- go in
a different --
Q: Car?

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 16
A: Car.
Q: Yeah. So in other words, they lined you up to get on the trains?
A: Five by five.
Q: Yeah.
A: But they -- when it came to them --
Q: They split up?
A: They splitup. They closed the door and we went into that one. And that was a
horror for me, because I adore my little brother and he didn't have his milk.
Q: Oh. Uh-huh.
A: And so I took care of my two little sisters.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And it took -- as the train stopped, people were trying to run away. They were
shooting. It was -- it was not pleasant. You were all scared. Three nights and two
days.
And when we got to Auschwitz, it was another horror. The screaming, the dogs,
the -- and all of a sudden, I find myself all alone. The whole family went on a -- ona
truck and they pulled me out. So I had long hair, young, and I climbed on the truck.
And one saw me and he pulled me by the hair and he throw me down. By that time, it
was --
Q: You climbed on the truck that your family was --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- was on?
A: And then the truck went away.
Q: So when you got off of the car, you saw your family?
A: Yeah. Sol find my family.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 17
Q: You found them?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: I find them.
Q: Let's go back a little bit in the -- when you were going to the camp. You said it took
three days and three nights. What -- what were people doing in the car? Were they
helping each other? Were they being of comfort? Do you remember --
A: I was very sad.
Q: -- what happened to you? Uh-huh.
A: First of all, the -- it was --
Q: Was it all women?
A: First -- no, mixed.
Q: It was mixed?
A: Yeah.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: They were doing holes in the bottom to try to escape. They -- there was no water.
Everybody was thirsty. It was no toilets, so it wasa mess. And --
Q: Was there any light in the car?
A: No, there was no lights.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: It was cars that they used for pigs and, you know, pasture work.
Q: Did they let you out at all?
A: No. No.
Q: And what were your little sisters --
A: Probably they were half --

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 18
Q: -- doing?
A: We were half in a different world, you know. We just didn't talk. We didn't know
what to do. We were -- we were lost. We were completely lost. And I was a very
naive. Being raised in a big family, you become very -- and my parents were very strict
too. Couldn't get out at night. We couldn't do this, we couldn't do -- it was schooling
and practice and do this and helping my mother a lot too. It just was -- so I was a naive
little girl -- young girl for that age.
I saw my daughter at 16, she wasn't like -- not like me. Nota role.
Q: So you arrived at Auschwitz and you said you tried to get on the truck --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- that your family was on --
A: Uh-huh.
Q: -- and they took you off?
A: And they took me off. I didn't know what the reason they took me off, but they
usually took 10 percent out of each transfer that came. Usually they took women in their
30s because they have much more to offer. They have their pasts and they have a future
to fight for. But I didn't have a past and I didn't have a future, so I -- fighting for me was
nothing. I was just crying all the time. But in camp --
Q: Then they took you where in the beginning?
A: They took --
Q: They took you off the truck. Uh-huh.
A: Truck. And then they march us into Birkenau.
Q: This was a -- you were with a group of women?
A: Yes.
Q: And when you got to Birkenau?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 19
A: Birkenau, they put us in a big room. And Iwas having my period. And I went over
to the -- to the SS to ask her for something.
Q: This is a woman guard?
A: Yeah.
And I went bouncing on the other side of the room. By that time, my period stopped and
I never had anything, so I came back.
Q: She threw you to the other side of the room --
A: Yes.
Q: -- when you asked her?
A: And they did this. They put the tattoo.
Q: This was when you first arrived?
A: Yeah, first arrived.
And then they brought in -- now that I'm a little older -- well, first of all, I was ashamed.
I never had a men looking at me nude. I was -- they were such monsters, now that I
think of it. It's just so horrible. Because they brought in French men, undressed us, and
shaved us from all over. Not only the hair, but --
Q: On the body?
A: Private part and everything.
And Iwas crying. I was ashamed. And they said, Don't be ashamed; we don't even
notice.
And they put us in the hot bath, schweitz bad (phonetic). And then they gave us a cold
shower and uniforms. And that's it. And they put us in -- the next morning, we went to
work.
Q: So you did not have any belongings --
A: No.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 20
Q: -- from before? They took everything that you had?
A: They took everything, yeah.
Q: Were there many young women like you in your group?
A: No. Mostly they were in their 30s. And I was very lucky, because I find camp
mothers, like I called them, two French women who really took care of me. They knew
that I was -- wouldn't survive if they wouldn't have taken care of me.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: They're both dead now.
Q: So they -- and where did you go -- where did you sleep that first night?
A: Oh, they had the huts, you know. So where you slept, three tiers.
I don't know if you went to Birkenau.
And they give you a blanket and a pot to eat, but it served for everything, because there
was no bathroom. But you couldn't sleep because people were stealing from you. You
didn't ever took off your shoes, because people were stealing it. And once -- it was very
hard because it was -- to this day, I don't sleep.
The first two weeks was -- was really a horror because we didn't have water. And water
is the main thing for survival. And I saw people urinate -- and it was cold, you know, so
it froze and they sucked it. I did the same thing, to survive. Then we were quarantined
because everybody got the dysentery. So -- and after that, I wanted to kill myself and I
went to the -- to the electric field.
Q: Fence?
A: Fence. Buta German saw me and shoot -- but he shoot at my foot. It got infected,
it got like -- and one day, they took me to the Block 25, which 1s -- I don't know if you
knew about it, but 25 is they selected the people —

Q: Uh-huh.
A: And over there, I find Toni, which was my -- she became my camp mother.
Q: She was in Block 25?
A: Yeah. She was a struberval (phonetic), the ones who take care of the other people,
you know, just -- well, she came in 1941, so she had all the -- she knew what to do.
Q: Was she another French woman?
A: Yes, but she was born in Poland.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And they took the Polish people first.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: The foreigners.
And she fought very hard for me not to go to the crematorium, but he didn't want to listen
to all that. He took me there and I went -- while he was driving, I was in the back of it,
and I told him that I'm not going to die, he's not going to put me in the gas chamber, I
have all my family living. And that did it. They wanted to know how many Jews are
still free. And while I was walking into the gas chamber, he said, you -- you -- sie

schmutzig, come. You dirty -- you're a pig, Jew, whatever. Come. And he brought me
back to camp.
That was luck, because he was not that nice after that.
Q: So you went back to --
A: And he --
Q: You went back --
A: And I worked there. I worked at Block 25.

So it was a Dr. Rose. I don't know if you ever heard of her. She was really something.
She doesn't show her head in no place. She wanted my rations so she could heal my
foot.
Q: She was another prisoner?
A: Yeah, French one.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: And we did. We gave her a bit of ration. And she opened the wound and --

A: Drained it.
It was no medication. It was just plain luck that it healed.
And then they -- they closed up that block and we went on the road working.
Q: How long were you in Block 25?
A: Maybe afew months. Not long ago.
Q: What -- when you said you had to give up your rations, what were you getting for
food?
A: Oh, a piece of bread and a piece of cheese. In the morning, coffee. You know,
coffee. I don't remember what it was. And lunchtime, soup.
If you didn't go to work. If you went to work, you didn't get anything. You only ate
when you came back to camp.
Q: Did they ever take you out for counting or --
A: Oh, yes, we stayed every morning at 4:00 in the morning and they counted us.
Q: What was that like?
A: Well, it was very difficult because we stayed straight for about three hours.
Q: Just standing there?
A: Just standing there.

And then they opened up a Jewish hospital. Nota hospital. You brought in half-dead
people and then you took them up. But the only thing they wanted is to take their
number. They were very organized, you know. Terribly organized. In the morning
when we came out, there was nothing left but bones. The rats had eaten everything up.
I went back recently and it's still I saw rats big like that. They're still there.
Q: Are we now still talking about Block 25?
A: Oh, no, that's -- they have closed up. This is a hospital they opened up.

A: Near Block 25.
Q: Isee. I see.

Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A: And that didn't last very long, but a couple months, and they closed that up too.
Q: So after you stayed in Block 25 for several months, then what happened?
A: I went to that hospital.
Q: The hospital, right. And you were there for a few months, probably?
A: Yeah. Not even afew months. A month or so.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: They didn't even wait for the people to die. They took them directly on the truck
and put them in the gas chamber and in the oven.
Q: At that point, did you know what had happened to your family?
A: Yes, I -- because you couldn't help it but smell, smell the grease of the person or
the -- it was a horror, a horrible smell of -- and people told me, you know, I -- in the
beginning, it was very hard for me to believe it. I had always wondered when it
happened to my little brother, he acted to that.

And then I worked on commandos. Oh, no. I did go in -- they picked me to go work
for the gentile hospital. For three months, I worked there.
Q: When you say you worked, what did that mean? What did you do?
A: There was no medication, there was nothing to do than to make them a little bit more
comfortable.

A: Yeah. Communists, the underground, a lot of Polish people, a lot of French people,

Q: Again, were you one of the younger women?
A: Yes.
Q: You still were one of the younger women?
A: Yeah.
Q: And were you with your friend Ton1?

A: They must have been about 25, 30 years older than I was.
Q: Older than you?
A: Uh-huh. They must have been close to 40.
Q: Uh-huh. And they were alone? Did they have any children?
A: Yes, they had children, but their children escaped. They had run out of camp
while -- they wouldn't have come in to camp anyway. But, apparently, they were -- they
were safe. They came back and they find their son alive, both of them, so they were --
Q: What was the youngest age that you saw there in the camp?
A: The youngest in the women, maybe 15 or 14. That's all. They were not -- in the
men, maybe a little bit more, but I did not know them. They were separated from us.
Q: You said you then worked in the gentile hospital --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and they closed that. And then --
A: They closed that.
Q: And then where did you go?
A: The commandos, potato commandos, in that commando and -- they find work for
you to do.
Q: Can you describe a typical day.
A: Well, you left at 8:00 in the morning, about staying up three hours. And the worst
commando was the potato commando.
Q: What did you have to do?
A: We worked on the ground and then pick out the good potatoes for the soldiers for the
SS and the bad potatoes for the camp, you know.
Q: Were these potato fields, were they in the camp grounds?

A: Well, I think it was starting fall -- not fall, but almost to the spring.

So you worked in the potato fields?
A: Yeah.
Q: What else?
A: On the road, like everybody else.
Q: What were you doing on the road?
A: Making roads.
Q: How’?
A: The water did not absorb. You know, it was like clay. So when the snow melted,
the water staggered on top. And it was very dangerous because mosquitos come out and
all those things. So we used to put big stones on top of -- making roads.
Q: On top of the water?
A: On top of the water.
Q: And what did you have to do?
A: We did that.

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 28
Q: You carried the stones?
A: Yeah, we carried the stone.
Q: And what were you wearing?
A: Well, I didn't have shoes, because I lost my shoes in the clay. Because by the time if
your foot got into it, you have to twist your foot to pull it out, and your shoe stayed with
it.
Q: So you were barefoot?
A: Barefoot, yeah.
Q: And your striped outfit?
A: And a striped outfit.
I usually -- the minute my hair used to grow back, I used to go and cut them because of
the lice. Oh, I had the -- the body lice, which gave me typhus. And I had twice typhus.
That was not funny. That was really --
Q: When you were sick with typhus, did you have to work?
A: Yes. Uh-huh. There was no hospital, there was no medicine.
Q: And so you were working on the road and carrying heavy rocks?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. And what was the treatment by the guards when you were doing this?
A: Well, you had the dogs and you had the -- if you didn't do fast enough, you had the
dogs on top of you, so plenty of marks on my back side.
Q: From -- from the dogs or from the whips or --
A: From both.
Q: You were beaten while you were --
A: Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Everybody was. I don't think very few people were not beaten
there, but I don't know.

Q: How did you keep going at this time with such terrible things?
A: Well, first of all, I had those ladies who really took care of me.
Q: Did they work alongside of you when you were doing the rock work?
A: Yes, they worked alongside of me. They usually had better jobs, but they always
bring me food. Which, I wasn't good of -- I was -- it was degrading me to go and steal
or beg for food. I was too young. I was -- so they used to bring me food and take care
of me or find a scarf for my head or find a pair of shoes that was too big, but it -- at least
they helped.
Q: When you said you cut your hair off if it got too long, how did you do that?
A: I went to the barber. They have a lot of barbers. Well, prisoners, you know, men
prisoners. And they had -- well, first of all, 1t was very dangerous to have hair.
Q: Why was it dangerous?
A: The lice, one thing. And if you had -- you usually have curly hair, they like that.
They like when you are pretty. And you couldn't be pretty in camp, you know. They
took you out, clean you up, and send you toa home. So you have to be very careful with
that.
Q: You were talking about working with the roads and --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- getting beaten?
A: But that wasn't the worst thing. The worst thing was -- Mala was a Belgian girl who
spoke a lot of languages. She was a strakerine (phonetic). That was an interpreter, an
interpreter for the Germans, and they loved her.
Q: Was she -- was she a prisoner?

A: Yeah. And she worked with a Polish underground prisoner too. She escaped. But
before she escaped, she -- I was walking in -- because when you walked in from
the -- from a commando, you had to sing.
Q: This is when you were marching back --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- to your barracks?
What did you have to sing?
A: German song.
Q: All the women were singing?
A: Yeah. And if you didn't sing, he went the whip.
And she says -- she told me, Marie, meet me at -- someplace, you know. So I said,
Why? She says, I have a -- I may not say you lie, but you'll have maybe four months,
good months.
So I went and I met her at that time. And that's when it was April, March.
Q: Of?
A: 1944.
Q: Now we're in 1944?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. So all of 1943, you were working?
A: In commandos for the -- different commandos.
Q: Anything else besides the potatoes and the roadwork? Did you do anything else,
that you could remember?
A: I don't remember that. But, you know, you did so many things. They caught you
and you did anything, yeah.

A: ‘4,
And she says, You're going to go to Brzezinka. I said, What is Brzezinka? She said,
It's a crematorium and the gas chamber. They have a half a million Hungarian Jews are
coming in. That's when the time they -- and they need people to select. We do not
select the people to -- who die or not. The women fold the clothes and look for jewelry
and make packages to send it to Germany.
Q: This is the belongings of the Hungarian Jews?
A: Right. The women did that job. The men did the other -- the worst job.
Well, that really almost drive me crazy. I couldn't take it.
And my bed was given right at the oven. So you know the old-fashioned red wooden
thing, they used to put the gas people on top of that. And some were still moving. And
shove into the -- I was thinking about my family, you know. Was they alive, was they
dead when this happened.
A half a million, that didn't have enough room for that, so they made trenches, put the
kids in, put some gasoline, and light them.
The screaming and the yelling, I still dream about it. It was ahorror. I never talk to
anybody about, because I was ashamed.
Q: Ashamed? What were you ashamed of?
A: Of being -- I had to do -- see. And I was sending the clothes to Germany and -- and
after this would be finished, we knew that we going to die because they didn't want to
have any witnesses for that.
But lucky enough, the Russian were coming too fast.
Q: Okay. Well, we'll talk about that in a minute.
So when you were working there -- this was beginning in April of '44 -- you were -- you
were also staying, but you were sleeping there at night?

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 32
A: Yeah. And we had clean sheets, we had showers, we had the food as much as you
want. They fed you so you shouldn't -- you shouldn't -- you should be happy, you
should not revolt yourself or, you know --
Q: Who were the other people that you were working with?
A: People who were picked. Some men and some women. A friend of mine was
working with me, Maria.
Toni and Matilda, they worked in factories already at that time. They worked for -- they
making cars now -- Mercedes.
Q: Did you -- did you have any contact with Toni --
A: No.
Q: -- or Matilda?
A: They were away. They were in the middle of Germany. We were still in Poland, in
Krakow -- in Krakow. The factories were in the middle of Germany where they were
making -- anything but cars.
Q: So you -- you stayed -- you lived every day --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- near the crematorium?
A: Well, yeah, it was from here to here.
Q: Just a few feet?
A: It was very close. Very, very close.
Q: And was every day the same?
A: The same thing, the screaming of the children, the yelling. Every day was coming
another transfer.
You know, in six months, a half a million, that's a lot. That's an awful lot. It took them
four years for six million.

Q: And what were -- do you remember what you were saying to your fellow prisoners?
Was there any kind of exchange of thoughts?
A: Well, we all felt the same thing, we're going to die, they're going to kill us, they don't
want any people who saw all that horror. They -- and Eichmann was -- monsters. They
were looking into gas chamber and laughing like it was, you know, a play, it was like -- it
was ahorror. It was terrible. It was just awful.
And one part of the men revolted there instead of. Of course, they were killed.
Well, it took another year, the group of men who did the gassing and the burning.
But that lasted from April to January.
Q: You did this from April to January?
A: Uh-huh.
Q: And what was -- again, what was your health like then? You said you were eating
all right at that point.
A: Yes. My health was okay, but my mental attitude was terrible. I was crying day
and night. And I was --
Q: Were you able to share your feelings with any of the other people?
A: Oh, yes, with other people. We all felt the same thing. We all felt the horror of the
whole situation.
Q: And, again, were you one of the youngest to be doing this?
A: Yeah, I was the youngest.
Well, they had something to live for, say their husband, wife maybe, or their children still
alive. I knew my family was gone. About three months, I was in camp, I saw a friend
of the family, and I said, Where is my father? And he said, He just died two weeks ago.
So I knew everybody was dead --
Q: Uh-huh.

A: -- [had nobody left.
Q: Uh-huh. How do you think you kept going during that terrible, terrible time? Do
you have any --
A: When I came back, you mean, or --
Q: No, no, no, when you were doing this terrible work. What kept you going?
A: The idea of seeing them lose the war and having maybe one hour of freedom or
eating one orange or seeing a tree. You -- you imagine you want to see them being
beaten by the -- and my dream is to take the subway for an hour. And then after that, I
didn't care what would happen to me.
That's what made you live, I guess, or fight. And love has a lot to do with it. I think my
time wasn't there to die yet. I believe very much in that.
But that's the way you fight. You know, you fight every day that maybe today it's going
to be the end of the war, maybe today they're going to lose it, or maybe today they're
going to -- and then when it came, I couldn't do what some people did when they lost the
war. They used to beat the SS, they used to spit in their face. I couldn't do that.

Germany.
Q. So these were clothes from the Hungarian --
A. Yeah.
Q. -- victims.
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And where -- did you work in a warehouse or --
A. It was a big room. It was built specially for that. They had five crematoriums,
and they build five big rooms. We weren't -- it's -- it was pretty far one from the other,
but that's what happened. You know, they build the big rooms, and it was a lot of
clothes coming in, pounds and pounds, of clothes from -- because people brought some
with them. Bring the best thing you have, the jewelry, and this and, you know, so that's
what we did.
Q. Uh-huh. So you sorted out women's clothes and men's clothes and sizes?
A. Right. But then after a little while, they sold the -- it was too close for the people
to see what they were doing, so they put on the -- they put blankets so we shouldn't look
atit. Weshouldn't see. But the smell and the screaming and the yelling --

A. Yes. Uh-huh.
Q. The same --
A. Oh, sometimes when someone died, and you have the same size, and they were
clean enough, you were -- or they had no lice -- because people died very quickly.
Sometime when they arrived, in two, three days they were dead. So people used to
change around. Otherwise, you wear the same uniform.
Q. For years?
A. For years.
Q. What would you wear under your uniform?
A. Nothing. There was nothing to wear. We had lost so much weight. It

Q. What do you mean given by men?
A. Yeah, the showers. They would turn on the water by men. And they
were -- we had clean sheets on the bed, and we could change uniform if we wanted to
at that time in that period of time. So for four months, it was -- well, they didn't want to
we should revolve, you know. That's a way of pacifying the people. That's the way of
doing --
Q. Now, did you have any contact with any of the women that you were with in the
beginning once you started this new work?
A. I had a tooth ache, and I asked to go into Birkenau, you know, and I saw Tony
(ph) there and Matild (ph) -- no, not Matild (ph), but Danielle Casanova (ph) who was a
dentist, and she was a communist, not Jewish. She pulled the tooth for me.
Q. How did she pull it? Did she have any --
A. No, with a plier. I don't have much teeth in my mouth.

which is, um — but, so they said some, are they coming into camp, so it can't be that bad.
Q. These are the Hungarians saying this?

A. Then -- well, the Russian were coming in too fast, so they did not want to -- the SS
did not want to be liberated by the Russian so they start to walk us. We walk for 3
nights and 3 days. I don't know, but it was a hard walk in the snow and the cold and no
food or nothing. We arrived in Ludlowe, which is pretty far from
Birkenau -- from -- not Birkenau, from regime camp. And they put us in trains, open
trains, cattle trains.

A. Yeah, the camp was evacuated.
Q. What was the talk among the people at that time among the prisoners?
A. Well, we was, to an extent, we were quite scared because every camp we stopped,
they didn't want us. They had their own people so we were traveling from one camp to
another one. In the meantime, people were dying on the train. We had to sleep on top
of them. We had to. We couldn't do anything, and --
Q. You walked for 3 days and 3 nights and then got to the train?
A. Yeah. And then we asked for water. They didn't want to give us water, and we

we stayed, January, February, March -- no, into February. And February, I was very
happy to get out of there because they were doing experimental on women, and what we
saw was so horrible that we wanted to get out as fast as possible. And they did send us
to a little camp, Prchin-Malkov, it was called.
Q. Let's talk a little bit about the conditions at Ravensbruck.
A. Oh, God.
Q. If you're able to.
A. It was unbelievable. People cannot believe what was in Ravensbruck.
Q. What happened when you first got there? You were on the train, and it stopped
there?
A. Yes. And we got off, and they put us in a room, and people were laying all over,
and they were dead. They were completely dead. Cold as ice.
Q. These are men and women?

A. Yes, because --
Q. Oh, okay.
A. -- because Birkenau was only woman. The other camp was men. We were
not together.
Q. But when you were --
A. Men and women were separate.
Q. -- working at the crematorium, that was mixed, men and women?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. Oh, okay.
A. But they went to the men's camp.
Q. When it was time to leave. Oh, I see. Okay.
A. And we stayed, slept on the dead people. We eating, we didn't eat, I don't think
so, but most of the time we were walking around because we couldn't take the smell.
We couldn't take the idea of being with the dead people. It was horrible. Ravensbruck
was the worst thing I ever saw in my life. And then they send us a little bit outside of
Ravensbruck, and there they were doing experimental on women.
Q. Why did they send you there?

Q. Can you describe anything?
A. Oh, God. It was no description of that. There were no hands, no feet, half a
stomach out, one eye out, one eye in. It wasahorror. It was horrible. It was just
unbelievable. It was just --
Q. Were these people still alive?
A. I don't think so.
Q. So these were all dead?
A. I don't know. They never came back to the country. I think they were put

people, but nobody gave me, a piece to me, but I did -- I did very -- my mother used to

on and walk because the American are not far from here. See, they wanted to be
liberated by the Americans. They were right because the Russian were not very nice to
them. And I-- she said, the Americans are here. I said, oh, my God. She's crazy, you
know. I don't know if -- and I saw the Americans, but the junction, the Russian took
over that part. So we were in the Russian.
Q. What was your feeling when you first saw the Americans?

front of me, who walks in front of me told there, that bastard of the Nazi who did all the
selection for the gas chamber, him, and Mengele, and Eichmann, you know. And he
turns around, and he wasn't civilian. He turns around, and he said, shoo (clap). Sol

A. We continued walking, and the Russian took over. They put us in the
prisoner -- camp, military camp, with soldiers who walk prisoners. They brought -- the
Americans did not know how to -- unfortunately, they were young kids, and there
immediately was butter, and milk, and chocolate, and people were dying. They used to
get diarrhea, and that's it. The Russian knew better. They brought us potatoes and rice,
and they locked us in. They say, you don't walk out because of the Mongolian. They
were raping every child, every woman, everybody they could find. So we didn't walk
out.
Q. What was your physical state at that point? Do you know how much you
weighed?
A. Oh, I -- I have pleurisy. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't eat. I was in bad shape,
very bad shape. At that time already, I was not good at all because I came back to Paris
in 19 of May, and the 20th, I was in the sanitartum.
Q. Okay. So how long did you stay --
A. In the --
Q. No. In the Russian cell that you --
A. We stayed back 3 weeks, and then they wanted to take us to Odessa to the Black
Sea and go back to Mauthausen. That was a little too far. We were very close to
Belgium, and Holland was closer to be that way. So we asked them, and they say, fine,

came from England with the goal, they took over a train, and, of course, they had to
go -- it was so destroyed. German was so destroyed that we had to go to Holland, and
from Holland to Belgium, and from Belgium to France.
Q. So you got back to Paris?
A. Yeah.
Q. And who were you with when you got back to Paris? You were with --
A. I had nobody.
Q. Okay. What did you do when you got back?
A. They had a hotel, and they put us ina hotel. And I say, I'm not going to go back
to another camp. To me, a hotel was another camp. I just didn't want to do that. SoI
went to Tony (ph), and I stay with her. She had come back early. She spoke Polish, so
it was easier to come back right early. So -- and she find her husband and her child.
So I stayed with her.
Q. Did you really believe you were free at that point after all those years?
A. No. So it was very hard to believe I was free. I was always looking in the
back if some -- if a German was not in the -- following me?

A. Yeah. And even in concentration -- in the sanitartum, when I saw a blond with
blue eyes, I said, he's going to kill me. He's a German doctor. — I could use psychiatry,
but in France it didn't exist yet.
Q. So you we went back to your friend Tony (ph) and --
A. Yeah.
Q. And how long did you stay with her?
A. I stayed not long because they -- when I went through a medical examination, they

husband saw my husband in the street, and he said, I have a girl who got an English
letter, and she doesn't know the address of her uncle. | Would you -- where do you come
from? He said, well, I have a sister living in Philadelphia. And she looked up all the

Singers (ph), and she find them. And that's the way the correspondence started, you
know, in between him, and he used to bring it to me, and that's it. When I came over
here, he was living with -- he was going to school. He finished college because he was
very young when he got into the army. And he didn't like to live with his mother and
sister, and I didn't like to live my uncle. He was -- they were nasty people. So he said,
well, [have a solution. Let's get married. So we got married.
Q. Uh-huh. And you've lived in Philadelphia ever since?
A. Since. Yeah, 44 years.
Q. Uh-huh.
(Tape cut off.)
A. Yeah. Ihave two children. I have a boy and a girl.
Q. Uh-huh. Can we talk a little bit about them? When they were growing up,
did you ever share any of your experiences with them?
A. That was one mistake, but I felt I didn't want to make them feel guilty. I
wanted to raise them with normal, normal way, you know, not that they should feel sorry
for me or pity or something like that. I'm paying itnow. My daughter said to me the
other day -- she told my husband, she didn't tell me -- that after 50 years, she should
forget it already. I'm sick and tired of it. I'll never forget that. My son 1s different.
He's much more sensitive, and he -- He talks about it. He reads about it. And my
daughter, well, I think her husband has a lot to do with it, too. They don't want their

children to know anything. They don't want to make them feel -- the older grandson
asked me, grandma, why don't you tell me the story of your number, and immediately
(clap) my daughter said, some other times. Notnow. He's going to be 13 years old.
He should know, but that's it. That's -- we made our will, and I'm going to leave some
money to the Holocaust Museum for a lot of education for the young people. Whatever
we can, we're going to leave. And it's very important to me. I think -- it can happen
again, very easily, and in America.
Q. What is your feeling, having gone through what you did, what is your feeling
about being Jewish?
A. Well, I'm not ashamed if you want to -- when I lived in Paris, I -- we had Jewish
friends and non-Jewish friends, and somebody told me one time, if you have Jewish
friends, don't go out with them. Apparently, we didn't -- in France, they don't tell you
what religion you are when they meet you or -- it's very -- it's not like in America where
you immediately you ask what, how much you make, and how much this and how much.
Over there it's not like that, and I was a little bit ashamed of saying I was Jewish. I
should have told them at that time. I should have slapped him. Now, do it because I
feel that they deserve it, but I can't hate either. I can't. I don't like the Germans, and I
don't like the people who are assymetrical (ph) of racials, or I don't like them, but I don't
want to destroy myself either. Hatred is very difficult. I should be taking out of the
dictionary, look what happened to the Germans. They hated, and they destroyed

themselves, and that's the way I felt. I never went back to Germany. I will never go
back to Germany. That's one thing I promised myself.
Q. Why not?
A. To a certain extent, I'm scared that they are going to keep me there. A very
normal reaction. And just the language, to hear the language, gives me the -- I'm
scared. Igetscared. It's, I think, it's a normal feeling.
Q. Do you receive reparations?
A. Yes. Not much, because I didn't --
Q. How do you feel about getting them?
A. To say I deserve it, yes, I guess I do, but if I would have stayed in France, I would
have gotten 3 times as much. Doing it from here, it's very little. |The worst part is to
go to the German counsel every year, and they tell me, sign your name with one N. Like
I don't know how my name is spelled, you know.
Q. What do they mean by that?
A. Well, two N is German.
Q. Uh-huh. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any thoughts? Any
feelings?
A. No.
Q. Anything that we've left out?

Interview with Marie Zosnika Schwartzman 60
A. I'm sure that when I go home, I'll remember many other things. And certain
things, I don't want to remember. I really don't want to, and I don't want to even talk
about it. It's too hard. It's too difficult. — It's -- I feel that I don't want to live if I have
to live with that, constantly talk about it. It's just too hard. I've lived with my family.
It's terrible. Maybe I should forget. Maybe I shouldn't remember so much, but we were
very close family, and I just can't forget it. It's very difficult. Very difficult.
Especially, I couldn't talk to him. My husband didn't want to hear about it. You havea
different country. You have a different life. Forgetit. So I learned to just keep it in
myself and having a lot of ulcers. And I never talked about it. _ It's very difficult.
The only time I used to talk is when I used to go back to Paris, and all my friends were
living. And they all died already. And --
Q. These are friends from childhood?
A. No, from camp.
Q. Oh, you mean --
A. Yeah. From childhood, I have -- they're not Jewish, but they're very, very
nice. I lived with them. They clothed me. It was very -- and when we talk about that,
they knew all my family, and when we talk about it, she cries, like Ido. I just -- but
most of the, my family, my father's family, are, like I said, they said to me, um, a French
policeman -- I didn't have any money to have a winter coat, and I didn't have a winter
coat when I came back, and he got me material. It was a French policeman, and a cousin
of my father made a coat.

Q. This is when you returned after the war?
A. Yeah. And he asked me for money. Then his sister said, well, I can give
you a coat for cheaper, but I don't have room for you. Buta gentile took mein. So, you
know, I don't know what to think about it. I don't. Some good ones. Some bad ones.
And you can't put everybody in the same bag.
Q. Any message to your grandchildren?
A. Well, I hope they grow up to be sensitive young men and to learn what went on,
not to be blinded by their parents. That's what I feel. It's very important for the young
kids to do that. It's very hard.
Q. Before we finish, I just wanted to know what your feelings were when you
received your number on your arm?
A. Oh, I felt like I was cattle, you know, stamped. And I ran out -- it was February,
and it was muddy, and I took the mud and tried to erase it off, but it didn't come off.
And I felt very bad. I felt -- well, maybe someday if I come out alive of here out of the
camp, I'll have it taken off. And then when I asked my doctor to do that, he said he
wouldn't -- he didn't want to do it. He said this should be the diamonds for your
grandchildren. And that's true. That's what he told me. Doctor Rosemoth (ph). So
I kept it on. Many people took it off, but I kept it on. I don't care anymore. It's part of
me, and it's part of what I went through, and it doesn't bother me if people make bad
comments or laugh about it. It's just, I take it with a grain of salt, and that's it. I

have long sleeves, but before -- you know, when I first came over, they made big
numbers. Now, they have -- later on they put the numbers right here, but then they are
in the front, which it doesn't show so much. This showsa lot. Iwas the 35th thousand
person incamp. From 6 million, that's early. That's very early. And this is Jewish.
The gentile did not have that. Just the number. That'sit. But I rubbed it very hard in
