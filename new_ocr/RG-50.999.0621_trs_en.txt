First Person: Conversations with Holocaust Survivors
First Person Fritz Gluckstein
July 20, 2017
>> Bill Benson: Good morning, and welcome to the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host
of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for joining
us today. We are in our 18th year of First Person. Our First Person
today is Dr. Fritz Gluckstein, whom you shall meet shortly.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the
Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their
experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests
serves as a volunteer here at this museum. The museum's website,
www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming
First Person guests.

This 2017 season of First Person is made possible by the
generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, with additional
funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We are grateful
for their sponsorship.

Fritz will share with us his "First Person" account of his

experience during the Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45
minutes. If time allows, we will have an opportunity for you to ask him
questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades.
What you are about to hear from Fritz is one individual's account of
the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help
with his introduction.

Fritz Gluckstein was born in Berlin, Germany, on January 24,
1927. This photo is from 1932.
He was the son of a Jewish judge and Christian mother, Georg and
Hedwig Gluckstein. Here we see Fritz with his parents at the beach.
These contemporary photographs show places where Fritz lived,
attended school, and played.
As a child, Fritz enjoyed family activities, friends, and school
gatherings. Here Fritz is circled in the middle.
After the Nazis came to power, Fritz's father lost his job as a judge
and because of his father's and mother's backgrounds, Fritz was
considered a geltungsjude, a counted Jew.And we will hear more
about that in a little bit.
The Nuremburg racial laws based Jewishness on genealogy and
religious practice. This is the star that Fritz, as a geltungsjude, was
required to wear.
Throughout these difficult times, Elfriede Dressler, Fritz's aunt,
provided the Glucksteins with much needed extra food as their rations
continued to decrease. In this photo we see Fritz and his Aunt Elfriede
after the war.
At the end of the war, Fritz's parents stayed in Germany and his
father, Georg, resumed his Here we see Fritz with his mother and
father after the war.

Fritz decided to immigrate on his own to the United States and arrived
in the U.S. in 1948 where he studied veterinary medicine.

Fritz lives in the Washington, D.C. area with his wife, Maran.
Following his arrival in the United States after the war, he eventually
became a doctor of veterinary medicine.

After a stint in the U.S. Army, Fritz began a long and distinguished
career with the federal government including at the U.S. Department
of Agriculture and ending with the National Library of Medicine. He
became an expert on diseases that are transmitted from animal to
humans, like "Mad Cow Disease."

Fritz is a self-described opera buff and a football fan and told
me he likes to watch football on TV while listening to the opera. He
volunteers for the museum translating letters and other documents
written in German, including hand-written documents. He is among a
few people who are able to read the old-style German cursive script.
He has a daughter, Ruth, and two granddaughters: Emily who is 18
and Brielle is 15. Fritz says they are the joy of his life.And Maran, who
would be with us today with Fritz, is today in New York City singing
with her choir.

Fritz has authored a memoir about his survival in Berlin. After
today's program, he will sign copies of his memoir, "Geltungsjude:
Counted as a Jew in Hitler's Berlin," which is also available in the
museum's bookstore. Fritz donates all profits earned from the book's
sale to this museum. He is also a member of the Survivors Writing
Group and a contributor to the museum's publication, "Echoes of
Memory."

With that, | would like you to join me in welcoming our First
Person, Fritz Gluckstein.

[Applause]

>> Bill Benson: Fritz, thank you so much for being willing to be our
First Person today. You have so much to share with us in a short
period. We'll start right away if that's ok.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: All right.
>> Bill Benson: You were a young boy when Hitler came to power in
Germany. Let's start with | telling us about your family and you during
those years, living under the Nazis as their power grew and as part of
that, tell us what it meant to be geltungsjude, or counted as a Jew.
What did that mean for you and your family.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: A geltungsjude had one Jewish and one
non-Jewish parent and was raised Jewish. He was subject to all the
regulations and had to wear the star. The Nazis couldn't make up their
mind. The farther away he lived from Berlin, the more likely he was to
escape deportation because there he was subject to the whims of the
local commander.

Before Hitler, we had a very nice life. My father was a judge. He
taught me how to salute the flag.
>> Bill Benson: He won the Iron Cross in the First World War?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Iron Cross in the First World War because didn't
serve in Germany. But we had a very good life. Went to the zoo.
Watched the big gorilla who when he got an apple, carefully looked.
And in one blemish, he would eat it.

My mother was Lutheran. We celebrated both Jewish and
Christian holidays. | got the best of two worlds, Hanukkah and
Christmas and Passover and Easter.
>> [Laughter]
>> Fritz Gluckstein: But came the day Hitler came to power, my father
was dismissed. The day he was dismissed, he told not to Lefcourt

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
through the front -- not to leave the court through the front door
because there was a demonstration. My father said, | "I | came in
through the front door and | will be leaving through the front door".

Of course, lost his job, money was quite a problem. We had to
move immediately. My Aunt Elfriede helped us very much, stood by
us. And my mother's relatives also stood by us. However, my father's
colleagues, at least most of them, said, so sorry, we can't have any
contact with you.
>> Bill Benson: And these had been colleagues on the court.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Other judges. So sorry. One or two maybe, but
most of them simply couldn't or didn't want to, | would say.
>> Bill Benson: Fritz, you were there, of course, during the 1936
Berlin Olympics. Tell us a little bit about that. What did it mean to you?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: 35, 36, signs showed up in restaurants Jews are
not welcome, and in the suburbs, go back to Paris signs. There were
special benches, the 36 Olympics signs disappeared. The moment
after Olympics, they came up again. They didn't want to see, people
from other countries, what was going on.
>> Bill Benson: On a bit of a lighter note, as hard as those things
were, you were still a boy and you had a mischievous spirit. You were
telling me about pranks would play on tourists.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: A friend of mine, sitting on a bus, double-decker,
we were sitting there. There was a tour. You see here, that is the
President's home. And over there [Indiscernible].
>> Bill Benson: During that time, Fritz, did your father make efforts to
try to emigrate from Germany to get out of Germany?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes, of course. But, of course, in order to
emigrate, first you had the quota, then you have to have money, and
then you were able to get passage. It wasn't so easy.

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Bill Benson: And so just all the doors were closed.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Couldn't just pack your suitcase and leave, no.
The quota was called. You only got a visa if you had passage. It was
quite difficult.
>> Bill Benson: So your family he's aliving under these
circumstances, as you said, conditions are very hard, food is scarce,
your father's lost his job. Then comes Kristallnacht or Night of Broken
Glass, November 9 through 10, 1938. You're just 11 years old. Tell us
about Kristallnacht.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, | went to school as usual. There was a
broken shop window. Could have happened. Then another one. The
third one | realized something was going on. And then | passed by the
synagogue and there were flames and smoke came out.

By the way, how did they know what windows to break? They
didn't have lists, no. About a couple of months before, the Jewish
shopkeeper had to place his name with white letters on the shop
window. All they had to do, look for the big white letters and could
break it.

| remember | went to school. Some of our teachers were sent to
the concentration camp. Got a notice for home: Because of special
circumstances, reports will be late. -- report cards will be late.
>> Bill Benson: Tell our audience was Kristallnacht was. That was
something that wasn't just in your community.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: No. It was all over. What had happened, in Paris,
a misguided young man shot and killed a council, German member of
the embassy. And, of course, in interrogation, there was an outbreak
of violence. Actually, the people -- it was done by well organized
groups.
>> Bill Benson: And it was all over Germany?

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Fritz Gluckstein: All over Germany. In fact, Berlin and small cities
were even worse. Berlin, of course, wasn't quite as bad as people
thought of. But little town, it was horrible.
>> Bill Benson: And on that night hundreds of synagogues before
burned throughout Germany.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: And many were sent to the concentration camp.
My father fortunately escaped.
>> Bill Benson: Did you realize at the time that it was across the
country?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | had a pretty good idea. We had a pretty good
idea.
>> Bill Benson: You said to me -- that was November 1938. You said
that the start of the war in September 1939, when Germany invaded
Poland, that's when things really changed for Jews and for your family
In particular.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, of course. First | had to take -- Jews had to
take the name of Israel and Sarah. | was Fritz Israel Gluckstein, 1941.
Start of the war. It we had to deliver jewelry, radios, bicycles first. And
rations, meat, white bread had special allotments. We were allowed
only to shop between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon. And a haircut,
some of the restrictions.
>> Bill Benson: When you shopped between 4:00 and 5:00, the odds
were good there was nothing left in the store.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. My mother could go if nobody was around.
The shopkeeper was decent, wait a minute, I'll give you something.
But.
>> Bill Benson: Among all of those restriction that took place, and you
mentioned a couple of them, besides radios and things like that, Jews
were forbidden from having pets.

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. That's right.
>> Bill Benson: Talk about, if you don't mind sharing, about your pet.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: We took care of a pet of friends who were
deported. They had trained him. If you gave him a piece of food and
said "From the Jew" he ate it. But if you said "From the Nazis" he did
not.
>> [Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: When did first start having to wear the star?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time, 41.
>> Bill Benson: And one of the things you shared with me is that
police would come by with pencils.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Oh, yes. There was a nasty policeman came with
a pencil. And if you get a pencil behind, pretty bad.
>> Bill Benson: When did deportations begin?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: In 1941. It started slowly and then more and more
after.
>> Bill Benson: Including many of your classmates and friends.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: When you had a neighbor or a classmate or a
colleague who was deported, did you have any idea where they were
being sent?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: No. Well, first, they said, well, maybe -- some
idea. Never really knew. At the beginning, actually, notice you would
be deported. And then they got the list. They had to list their
belongings and furniture. And in a certain time came an officer,
actually a policeman, and had to seal the arm -- apartment, and had to
go to the closest, nearest, corrections place and from there we were
transported.
>> Bill Benson: During that time, where were you living? Were you

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

still in your own home?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: A small apartment.
>> Bill Benson: Into a small apartment.

The allies started bombing Berlin about that time, too. What
was that like for you? You're facing the Nazis --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Hoped we wouldn't be hit. At that time | was still
going to school. If class beyond 1:00, school started two hours late.
>> Bill Benson: In the morning?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yeah. And we were sitting hoping it would stop
soon. On the other hand, maybe a little bit longer and school will be
shorter.
>> Bill Benson: Sounds like a typical kid.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time, yes. And school closed 1942.
>> Bill Benson: And being a kid, besides hoping that the bombing
would delay school, you also had a hobby of collecting shrapnel.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Collected shrapnel and exchanged for
bigger shrapnel. Boys.
>> Bill Benson: As you began to tell us, you were able to continue
school until June 1942 and then the schools closed. After that you had
several very close calls yourself with deportation. Tell us about those
and the events that followed. And also tell us about the closing of
school for you.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Closing schools and they gave me a final report
card. The reason, because of the ordered closing of the Jewish
schools. | guess most of my classmates were deported. A few, one,
two, came back. One or two went in hiding. And if you were a
geltungsjude, you survived but about 35, 40, all perished, and so did
the teachers, most of them.
>> Bill Benson: | was struck, in your book you write so eloquently

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

about your teachers and your fellow students as everyday heroes.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yeah. Particularly the teachers. They came,
taught us, helped us to forget the misery of everyday. They gave us
something we could build on later on. They came. We knew they were
deported but true to their profession they came. They didn't realize --
we didn't realize it, we didn't appreciate it. Now | know what they did.
>> Bill Benson: | was really struck by what you wrote about that.

You had a very frightening experience when your mother
helped someone who was facing deportation.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. My mother helped someone carry suitcases
to the collection point. An an SS man what are you doing? Tomorrow,
if your son and husband report downtown to the correction center.
Downtown was the special collection center. There we were, about the
time there were 10 men in a room and they also had non-Jewish
wives. Permitted to lie down because the Kommandant -- a nasty SS.
He had forbidden to lie down but did it anyway. However, the
policemen who guarded the building, whenever he left, the other came
running out, "Get up, get up. He's coming." Remarkable. We been
caught, we would have wound up at the Russian front.
>> Bill Benson: Is this when you encountered [Indiscernible]?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes, yes. Nasty. Came from Vienna. Well, after
two or three days, the Kommandant's office for interrogation. Well, my
father and an old gentleman prepared me, don't show any sign of
contempt or hostility, answer the question fully but do not, do not
volunteer anything.

Well, | went in the office. He was sitting there behind his desk.
At the side about 10 uniformed SS. He tried to catch me really -- your
mother is Jewish? No, | said, my mother is [Inaudible].

| had questions working at the Jewish community. | tell you,

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
give you a decent job. Tomorrow report to the labor exchange.

Outside | found my father. He stepped out. A sigh of relief. To
date, January 24, 1943, my 16th birthday, that was the first.
>> Bill Benson: That was the first. Tell us about the next one.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The second one. We were at the factory. One
morning a good friend of mine was sitting at the bench doing some
work for the Air Force. Suddenly the door opens and the SS officer
comes in. Get yourself outside! Outside we assembled. Asked the
driver to come in. The truck came. Put on the truck. And then back to
the SS, we were driven downtown. There we were in what had been a
dance hall. All the tables and chairs had been removed and we
camped in the middle. For some of the women -- it was Saturday, half
day, plenty of the children were in childcare, maybe at home. It was
very bad for them.

We were sitting there. It was amazing. No complaints. We were
sitting there. After hours, called by a very nice plain-clothed man, get
out of here, don't want to see you here again. We stepped out, about
8:00 at night. And by stepping out at 8:00 at night, we broke the law
because curfew for Jews was 8:00, through the winter 10:00 at night.
We walked home.

My mother was on a trip visiting her aunt. Sent a telegram, it
would be advisable if you came home fast. The next morning, just time
to get ration and | went to the ration card office and lo and behold
there was a big moving van. Everyone came on the moving van. And
we were transported to collection for the synagogue where | had my
bar mitzvah three years ago.

Then again we were transported downtown to a building of the
Jewish congregation, so-called Rosenstrasse. And there we were,
quartered in the room just enough to lie down. We spent our time

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
deliberating what happened to us.

Standing in line -- of course, facilities weren't set for hundreds
of men to come in. After a week or so,ed into, | remember, we got
once at 4:00 turnips to eat, | remember.

After a week or so, was called out. My release slip was typed
by a secretary of the Jewish congregation. And my father, too. And we
both were ready to leave. We had to present our release slip to the
sergeant, Sargeant Schneider. He looked at my father and said, |
judge you have been but you've certainly ruled the lives of many
people. My father said, | hope not. And we left.

But, what we did not know, while we were inside, there was a
demonstration where the mothers and wives demonstrated,
demanded the release of the children and husbands. Fight first the
regular police, then the SS and Gestapo. It was the only challenge to
authority to Third Reich.

Said, no, let's not have it now. We can take care of the mixed
marriages, geltungsjude let on, not know. Right after the Battle of
Stalingrad.

So after that | was sent to labor camp. We went side-to-side
cleaning up after air raids.
>> Bill Benson: Before we move on to that, just so we all hear that, it
was the only demonstration to the Third Reich.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The only demonstration against authority. They
didn't go.
>> Bill Benson: And there's even been a movie made about this.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes, a movie made. And now there is of the
people who stood up for their loved ones, yes.
>> Bill Benson: So now both you and your father are forced to be part
of these work details. So you started to tell us, what were you forced

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
to do?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, we had to clean up the ruins. We moved
around and cleaned up streets. Actually there was an accident, part of
a wall fell on me, Knocked me out and | was injured. There was a
medic. He fixed me up temporarily. They brought me to a hospital but
were not permitted, non-Jewish hospital were not permitted to help
Jews but they did it anyway. Sewed me up. They took a risk on my
behalf. They could have gotten in real trouble but they took a risk. I'll
never forget that.
>> Bill Benson: | was struck -- you shared with me that as you were
out there doing these work details where you're forced to clean up
rubble, really hard work out there --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Actually, of course, there were four other
young, former classmates. And the older men, lawyers, chemists,
engineers. Of course, young people don't learn anything. They
thought it a kind of school.

In my case, | remember a wheel barrel, when was being filled, |
was given a question to which | had to answer when | came back. And
still remember one. When you come back with an empty wheel barrel,
it remained the Great Lakes of the United States. Something else
imagined 50, 60 years. Of course, first the older men had to explain to
us some of the language to be used. Became very helpful later on
when | worked in a factory. Some nice people, really vital, teached me
four-letter words. | tried very much. It didn't work because those words
came [Indiscernible] very similar in German and they did not work.
>> Bill Benson: At one point during these forced labor work details
you were told that you were going to now have to do -- you had a
catastrophic mission.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. We were bombed out twice. Temporarily in

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
the Jewish hospital. In the morning | set out for my regular job,
stepped out of the building, suddenly some SS came. Go on the truck
there. You're detached to so-called catastrophe mission.

Well, after riding the truck, open it up, and there we were in
front of the devil's den. Eichmann's headquarter. Eichmann was the
driving force behind the depore deportation. You knew who Eichmann
was.

Well, very lucky, worked there. One young lieutenant, | was
assigned to him. | was lucky, he was very decent, not anti-Semitic,
really. Some of the other fellows had a very rough supervisor, nasty
time. Deputy commander running around with a dog and cursing, tried
to sneak up. | was lucky, again. Might move furniture. He was very
civil.

Well, one day -- | guess we moved from rubbish. Said
Ikeman -- Eichmann is coming. Oh, boy. | wondered, really wondered,
how we would look like. Ordinary. Nobody noticed in the crowd. Came
right next to me, gave some instruction, and left again.
>> Bill Benson: This absolute monster.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | stood shoulder and shoulder with that monster
but lucky.
>> Bill Benson: During that time, middle to the end of the war, you're
in Berlin. As you described it to me, Berlin was bombed all the time,
frequently. Food was scarce. Conditions were more and more difficult.
How did you and your parents manage to survive and exist under
those conditions? What was it like for you then?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, you adapt. Didn't lose hope. It was
amazing. Food was scarce. A loaf of bread, the mice had gotten into
it. Well, cut off what was important and continued eating. And, of
course, didn't change clothes very often. No hot water, no soap. You

https://collections.ushmm.org

just adapted. And, of course, for spirit, always told little story and jokes
that helped us.

[Inaudible] young man pulled him out. Friend, you saved my
life. What can | do for you? | want a state funeral. State funeral. Yes.
And father finds out | pulled you out of the river, he's going to kill me.
SS man said, | am going to shoot you. Unless you tell me which one
of my eye is glass. Oh, he said. Very easy. It's the right one. How do
you know? Oh, it looks so human.
>> [Laughter]
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Then, of course [Inaudible]. The bread was
horrible. Sometimes | don't know what they put in there. Everything
substitute. My father, when will this war be over? Well, when the
British eat rats and German eat rats substitute.

Those little stories.
>> Bill Benson: As the German defense of Berlin was collapsing, you
said to me that you and your friends figured it would take 31 minutes
for the Russian tanks to get through the barriers that had been put up.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yeah. What happened one day, fall 1941 -- 44,
we were detached to build foundations for a new Berlin after the war.
At that time. But detached again to build tanks, perhaps there. -- traps.
There we were digging ditches, 40-degree angles. So at night, |
guess, middle of the night they gave us some soup. Next morning they
told us, ok, you can go.

Well, we looked at our handy work and thought, now how long
will it take the Russians to get through? 31 minutes. The Russian
tanks will come, tank traps, will laugh for 30 minutes and take one
minute to get through.
>> [Laughter]
>> Fritz Gluckstein: That's actually what happened. Two armies

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
approached Berlin, from the east, from the South. Coming from the
South, got in very, very fast. They couldn't get to the Jews. There
wasn't too much fighting anyhow. | believe we helped a little bit. It
didn't do a very good job but actually helped us.
>> Bill Benson: In fact, you said you survived because of your
mother, luck, and the marshal.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: The eastern part of Berlin [Inaudible]
>> Bill Benson: Back to a point you were making a few moments ago,
Fritz. There's the Third Reich literally collapsing. You were assigned to
build the foundations for the new Berlin.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Foundation for a new Berlin after the war.
>> Bill Benson: At what point did you believe or know that you really
were safe?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, when the war was over. We were working
close to an SS -- what do you call it? Where they keep people.
>> Bill Benson: A barrack?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Barrack. Lo and behold what did we see? A
group of heavy trucks being pushed by SS men. If SS doesn't have
any gasoline [Inaudible] then we realized it was pretty much over.

We were delighted at their misfortune. | never forget it.
>> Bill Benson: I've read several accounts of the Russian assault on
Berlin and then about life in that devastated city in the months
following the war. If you'll say the threat from the Nazis is over but now
you're occupied by the Soviets in an absolutely devastated city, what
was life like for you immediately after the war?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually food at the beginning was pretty bad. But
actually after a while the Russians came in -- we were lucky. We had
some food in our place we lived. We had to move many times. Last
apartment with two other couples. And downstairs was the horse

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
butcher. The Russians brought the wounded horses to the butcher
and we could eat -- we had some horse meat.

Actually, what happened, at the time Jews still had meat, we
could go to the horse -- could have gotten double. One of our relatives
fed meat to the family and they never knew what are you feeding. Oh,
the butcher is very nice and gave us. Horse meat. When you have
nothing else, you eat it.
>> Bill Benson: How did the Russians treat you?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: First | remember -- came home and the Russians
were already at the apartment. But, of course, didn't believe me, Nazi,
Jews, one of the people explained. He believed that it wasn't SS.
>> Bill Benson: You had to convince them.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Young man what are you doing here?
>> Bill Benson: Did you or others that survived, did you consider
taking revenge on the Germans?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: No. We thought, yes. But we wouldn't lower
ourselves to this. No. No.
>> Bill Benson: You shared with me, and you wrote about it, too, that
the winter of 1945 to 1946 was exceptionally a tough winter. What
were conditions like then?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time -- the Russians, American, British
and the French. Russians black bread, Americans black bread. We
knew who was in charge. It was a horrible winter. And imagine, water
pipes broke, toilet couldn't be used. Can you imagine? People lived in
a suburb [Inaudible]. What did you do? Well, you could see people
with little packages which they deposited in box in the front lawns.
Freezing was ok but you can imagine what happened after it thawed.
But that was war.
>> Bill Benson: When was your father able to begin to resume his

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
work and his life after the war?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, after the war actually | was able to go back
to school and my father was reinstated, the time he lost. Sorry. Old
age.
>> Bill Benson: He was reinstated, got credit for his time.

So as Berlin was being rebuilt and beginning to come back, and
of course it was divided up between control of the Soviets, French,
British and the Americans. By 1948, you managed to come to the
United States.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | decided. My parents let me go with heavy heart.
My father said if | were 10 years younger, God bless you. But today |
can't. It's a completely different law. American law based on old
English law. | could not carry on my profession, but you go, he said, "|
hope you will choose a profession that is not limited to one country."
So | did.
>> Bill Benson: And to be a veterinarian. You can be a veterinarian
anywhere. Sound advice from your dad.

Your father and your mother stayed in Berlin. Did many other
Jews stay in Berlin?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Several. | would say the younger left. The older
people stayed because difficult to start a new life, a new language but
the young people left. | would say, yes.
>> Bill Benson: | was struck, you wrote in your book that after the war
you're going back to school. You were in a class and in your
classroom there were kids who like you, young men who hadn't had
an education, and returning German soldiers in the same classroom.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Well, after three years no school, went to
school, special courses in order to make up. We studied for the final
examination. There were German and Jews. And some of the German

young men had to leave early. At the beginning it was quite cool but
then we realized they were not all Nazis and they realized Jews are
not actually different from any other people. And we got along quite
well.
>> Bill Benson: So what was it like to come to the United States for
you? You came over on a ship. What was it like? And you were how
old, 21?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | was 21 on the boat. 30th January 1948. |
remember that. Standing on the ship. It was night. Looked in the
street, cars moving. | wondered, between expectation and
apprehension. Some people had great difficulties.

An organization | joined sent us to a hotel and there we had to
wait to be sent to a city where the Jewish congregation had agreed to
take care of some newcomers. And said, well, you can go either to
Detroit or St. Paul, capital of Minneapolis. | studied quite a bit about
the United States and | chose to go to St. Paul. | knew it would be very
cold in Minnesota but | had not heard yet, described as having only
two seasons, July and winter.
>> [Laughter]
>> Fritz Gluckstein: It was very cold in Minnesota.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what your name means.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Good luck stone.
>> Bill Benson: You talked about that in your book. Good luck stone.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Actually | had to decide, shall | change my name?
Should | call myself gladstone? No. Should | keep Fritz? Well in
St. Paul | went through the phone, and not many Fritz's, many
Scandinavian, lived in St. Paul and | kept the name.
>> Bill Benson: We mentioned you're an opera fan. Tell us how that
started.

>> Fritz Gluckstein: Jews were not permited to have radios. | had
[Indiscernible]. Without electricity it was wonderful. | listened every
night. Whenever we could expect an air raid. Tomorrow night they're
going to broadcast an opera, "Tosca." I'm going to listen. If I'm lucky
there will be no air raid. Ok, | put on my headphones and listened. And
| was completely tranced by the music. The opera, the diction was
excellent. | could follow. Not half an hour | listened, two hours until
"Tosca" [Inaudible] and from there | became opera.
>> Bill Benson: What has it meant to you to write your book, your
memoir? What has that meant to you?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, | think people might want to see what
happened. Actually more or less to tell. | came over here and could
make it, | would say. My more or less gratitude that in spite of all, it
wasn't easy but, yes, school, studying, had many jobs, elevator
operator, busboy, [Inaudible], and helping Ph.D. candidates in their
German examination. Didn't charge enough but really was called to
order for undermining the going rate. But | was able to make it.
>> Bill Benson: Yes, you were. In a stellar way. One last question and
then we'll turn to our audience for a couple of questions.

In light of the fact that you had homes bombed out and you lost
so much, how were you able to manage to have those photographs
we saw earlier?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes. Well, of course, bombed out twice. But, of
course, my good aunt, got pictures, and, of course, reproduced and
gave back to us.
>> Bill Benson: That's the only reason you have those photos?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Only reason. Otherwise nothing left. Bombed out
twice. Absolutely.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Let's turn to our audience for a few questions. We

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

have microphones in each aisle. We ask that you wait until you get a
microphone if you have a question. Try to make your question as brief
as you can. I'll repeat it just to make sure that we understand it
correctly, and then Fritz will respond to it.

Do we have anybody -- we have right here in the front row. Ok.
We can hear you but the back of the room may not so we have to put
a mic in your hand.
>> After you came to America, were you able to communicate with
your father and your mother or today even your extended family that's
still in Germany?
>> Bill Benson: The question --
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Ok. Fritz has got it.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: At that time telephone and letters.
>> [Question Inaudible]
>> Bill Benson: Was the system disrupted after the war? Could you
communicate freely with your parents? Right after the war.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: And your father eventually came to the United States.
>> Fritz Gluckstein: | was stationed in the Army at Fort Detrick and
my parents visited.
>> Bill Benson: Ok. Another question. One over here.
>> When did it become apparent to you and your family and your
neighbors the magnitude of what was with to happen?
>> Bill Benson: When did it become apparent to you and your family
and others around you the magnitude of what was actually taking
place with the Holocaust and what did take place?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Well, of course, we knew something was going
on but actually we never knew exactly what happened. At the

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
beginning we still could send some food to people in Polish cities.
After a while, no call back. And, of course, we had an idea but didn't
know for sure.
>> Bill Benson: How quickly, when the war ended, did you actually
know what had happened?
>> Fritz Gluckstein: Some people came back, some were survivors
and told us what happened. And, of course, it was publicized, of
course, by the occupying forces what had happened. Made clear what
happened.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you.

Another question? All right.

Well, after we finish today, Fritz will go upstairs and he is going
to sign copies of his book. He will be available to sign it. So that will
also be an opportunity to ask Fritz another question if you have one or
just say hi to him.

Fritz, thank you for being our First Person.

[Applause]

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the
last word. So I'm going to turn back to Fritz for the last word.

| want to thank all of you for being here, remind you we'll have
programs each Wednesday and Thursday until August 10. The
museum's website will have information about First Person in 2018 so
we hope that if you have the opportunity, you'll come back and join us.

And one more thing before Fritz gets up on the stage, and that
is that our photographer, Lolitta, will come up on the stage, take a
photo of Fritz with you as the background. So if you would stay with us
for that, that would be great. And then we're going to try to get Fritz up
as quickly as we can so he can sign copies of his book.

Fritz, it's yours.

>> Fritz Gluckstein: It was my good fortune to come to the United
States. | am forever grateful for the help | received and the opportunity
given to me. | value my American citizenship most highly.

| am often asked what | have learned from my experience. My
answer is always the same. Don't do to others what you don't want
done to yourself. And do it now. Pay that visit. Make that call. Write
that letter. If you have a dream, go after it now. And if you have two
bottles of wine, drink the better one first.
>> [Laughter]

[Applause]
