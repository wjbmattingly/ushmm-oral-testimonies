>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson, | am the host of the museum's public
program, First Person. Thank you for joining us. We are in our 14th year of the
First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs. Regina Spiegel whom we
shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring
First Person.
First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust.
Each guest serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program continues
through mid August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides
information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.
Regina Spiegel will share with us her First Person account as a survivor for about
45 minutes. If time allows towards the end of the program, we'll have an
opportunity for you to ask her a few questions.
The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are
about to hear from Regina is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have
prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction.
Regina Spiegel was born May 12, 1926 in Radom, Poland. Her father worked as
a leather cutter for a large shoe manufacturer and her mother took care of their six

children. On this map of Europe, the arrow points to Poland. On this map of
Poland, the arrow points to Radom. On September 1, 1939, German troops
invaded Poland and Regina's town was attacked. Like all Jews in Radom,
Regina's family was ordered into a newly created ghetto. Regina's parents
smuggled her out by bribing one of the guards. She escaped to Pionki where her
older sister Rozia lived. Soon she was conscripted into forced labor and forged a
close relationship with Sam Spiegel, a fellow inmate.

This photograph is of Regina's sister Hanka, who was taken from the
ghetto and sent to Treblinka where she was killed.

We close with a photograph of Regina and Sam on their wedding
day in the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp in Bavaria. Upon arriving in
Washington, DC in late 1947, Sam found work as a sheet metal worker and over
time built a successful business in the construction industry. Regina and Sam
have continued to live in the Washington, DC area since 1947. They have three
daughters and nine grandchildren, with the youngest being 11 years old. Their
first great grandchild was born in 2011. Regina has spoken many times about her
experience during the Holocaust to a wide variety of groups, including at
numerous schools, such as my daughter's former high school.

Regina's volunteer work for the museum includes working at the
donor's desk, where you will find her Wednesdays, with the exception of today.
Sam was an active volunteer at the museum, but his recent illness has prevented

him from continuing. He spent a lot of time working on the "Remember the Child
Who Perished" programs, which calls upon young Jews as part of their bar and
bat mitzvahs to honor children who died during the Holocaust. Sam searched for
the names of children who perished, the name of the town from which they came
and where and when they perished. Until recently, Regina and Sam had
participated every other year in the March of the Living, which took them to
Auschwitz and Birkenau and other major camps, as well as to Israel in most
years. They went on 10 Marches of the Living.

With that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Regina
Spiegel.
[Applause]
Regina, thank you so much for your willingness to join us and be our First Person
today. We have a really great audience, and we have a great deal to cover ina
very short period, so we'll just get started right away.
Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Regina, you were 13 years of
age living with your family in Radom, Poland. First, let's begin with you telling us
about your family, your community and yourself in the years before the war, then
what happened when Germany attacked Poland.
>> Regina Spiegel: Thank you. | welcome you too, to this group. What | want to
tell you, that the minute the Germans came into our town, our life changed
completely. Because before the war, we lived like regular citizens, we had a nice

life. My father took care of the family. We always had enough to eat. We lived
nicely. But once the Germans walked in, our life completely changed, as if it
never existed before.

As a matter of fact, if you think about the 13th of September, it reminds you
probably of going back to school. So was it for us. All the young children were
supposed to go back to school. But you know what -- it never happened, because
the first order of their business was Jewish children were not allowed to go to
school. You can't imagine. It's fine once in a while, when you don't feel like going
that day to school, and it's all right with your parents' permission. However, when
somebody comes around and tells you you're not allowed to go because you
happen be born Jewish, that puts a completely different thing on everything you're
doing, because you know that you are in a lot of trouble.
Like my older sisters formed groups in the cellars in order to teach the kids,
because they were kids. This was their first year going to school. But they were
afraid. They can't be serious. So they want in order not to miss anything, they
told them, so they should be able to keep up with the learning. However, they
needn't have bothered, because children as a whole were their first victims.
| don't know why they were so afraid of kids. Kids cannot do anything. But that's
what they did.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, you told me that your father lost his job almost overnight.
Tell us how you were able to -- how he was able to provide food for you, how you
were able to make ends meet once he lost his work.
>> Regina Spiegel: It was very hard, because first of all the banks closed up right
away, So even if you had a little bit of money in the banks you could not access,
you had no access to them.

Of course, but it was rather hard, but we were able to barter with the neighbors.
You know, like my mother, usually in Europe, to this day | think, everything that
you had, anything like this or this -- | messed up. OK.
[Laughter]
OK. Anything like this I'm wearing was probably made of gold or silver, so you
were able to barter with our neighbors to get us some food. But it was terrible.
From the minute they walked in, we knew we were in trouble.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, it would not be too long before you and your family were
forced to go into a ghetto. Tell us what the ghetto was like, what the conditions
were like for you and your family going there.
>> Regina Spiegel: Do | have to?
>> Bill Benson: Just a little.
>> Regina Spiegel: Well, you know, one day they decided to -- because they saw
that somehow we're managing, you know, like | said bartering with our neighbors,
you managed. But putting us into the ghettos was really so terrible because you

take -- we were a fairly large family. We were eight of us. They put in another
family with us, So as a result when they came in the evening -- and we only got
like one room for everybody. So when they came in the evening to put your head
down, to go to sleep, it wasn't enough room for everybody.

So right away, it was so horrible that | can't even describe it. Because, you know,
| was still at that time a kid, and | was even then happy, because as long as | was
with my family it was OK for me, because | figured my family is going to take care
of me.
This soon changed, because my mother approached me and she said "Regina,
you have to leave the ghetto." | said "Why?"
She wouldn't -- you know, parents in those years didn't sit down, like my kids do
with their children, explain everything exactly why we have to do that. She said
"You're doing it, and there is no questioning." And | said -- | had a sister who was
two years older than | was, and | figured why do you pick on me just because I'm
the youngest one? But no, she somehow -- | don't know what she saw in me that
| never realized that she figured that maybe | have the best chance
Actually, when | couldn't do anything, | was so angry with her that when | left | just
took off my armband, because in those years you had to wear an armband that
showed that you were Jewish. So | took off my armband and just left. | never
said goodbye to my parents.

later on that she probably didn't -- that she did it because it was better for me. So
| left.
| got to my sister's, who lived in a little town, it was called Pionki.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, I'm going to stop you for just a moment. Tell us, you
walked out of the ghetto, which was not easy to do. Tell us how you got to Pionki.
>> Regina Spiegel: | walked out, | didn't have a penny to my name. And just
what | wore. | just walked out, and | got to a train. In those years, | don't know, it
was still warm, it was in Poland that during like vacation time, that you can travel
with an adult and you don't have to pay, a kid doesn't have to pay.

So when | came on that train, and | looked around, and | saw a lady sitting in the
side, so | sat down over there and | started talking to her. So when the guard
came in to check for the tickets, he didn't even look at me, because he assumed, |
think, that | was with her, and because | started talking to her. He just let me go.
So when | came to Pionki, | got off, and my sister actually met me there, and she
took me, because she lived in that little town, she was married, and she lived
there. She actually had a little boy. He was at the time 18 months old. And she
had also -- it was terrible, because she had this baby and she knew she couldn't
bring him in, in the camp, so she found a Polish woman who took care of the
baby. But after a while she, the woman, took the baby to the gestapo and told
them where my sister was.

As a matter of fact, after the war, | went to see her, asking her "Why did you have
to tell them where my sister was?"
At least, this way maybe she would have had a chance.
And she told me she could have never done this, because my sister would have
never forgiven her for that. But it didn't change anything, because when they
brought my sister there, and they actually wanted her to tell that this is not her
baby.
Because, you see, my sister was working there as a dentist, and they figured that
if they lose her where are they going to replace her now? They weren't always
available. So they wanted her to say "This is not my child," but of course, she
could never do that. And she and the baby were killed when she tried to grab the
baby, when she saw how they're stuffing everybody into the cattle trains. She
figured maybe she as an adult, because | was a lot of times on these cattle trains,
maybe she as an adult might survive. But the baby would never make it.
So she actually grabbed the baby, she tried to run away, and she and the baby
were shot. And that's how | lost, that | knew the first time, my sister.
>> Bill Benson: Once your sister was denounced and you lost her, you were in
Pionki, tell us about Pionki and what your life was like there.
>> Regina Spiegel: Pionki was a very important town. You know, | never realized
it held one of the largest powder munition factories in Poland, and therefore it
became a great factor, actually, in my survival and the survival of many, many

others, because the Germans made the slave labor camp. It was one of these
camps that men and women actually worked together. Not many camps that had
like this. Most of them they were separated. But in this particular camp men and
women worked together.

As a matter of fact, in that place | met my husband, because he was from another
town, and he approached me saying to me, "I know you." | asked him, "Are you
from my town, like from Radom?"
He said "No." | said "Where are you from?"
He said "A town in Poland" which | heard of it, Kozienice. | said "| was never in
Kozienice."
| told him he's just maybe saying something. But then he said | remember you,
because you worked someplace with somebody. | told him, | said, "So tell me
what did | wear?"
And he went to describe my clothes better -- if they would have asked me
“Regina, describe your coat" | would have never been able to do it. And he
described it with everything, with even my patch, that | had the patch in the
sleeve.
>> Bill Benson: Even though this was a camp that allowed both men and women
as Slave laborers, how did the two of you have the opportunity to talk with each
other?

>> Regina Spiegel: You see, in a certain time they gave us -- you know, after
many camps | realized this was probably not one of the worst, worst camps,
because we happened to have somebody who took care of us, who happened to
be, even though he was a German, lieutenant in the army, he still was like he's
human. Because we had a lot of people that were watching us, and they weren't
always very nice to us.

So he came out with an order, if they come back you can search them, you know,
when they come back from work, but during the time that they are in their
surroundings, in their camp, you are not to enter there.
There was a lot of talking about some people, some of the people that were
guarding the camp. Don't forget, we were young, young girls, not so bad looking,
so sometimes, you know, they wanted to do something to us.
He actually stopped them. As a matter of fact, also after the war we found out
about him, that he, when they took us, and this was -- can | go on?
>> Bill Benson: Mm-hmm.
>> Regina Spiegel: When | was there and they were trying to send us out
already, after working there, they decided to send us to Auschwitz, you know, as
I'm talking to you time moves, you know, it moves very quickly, and this was
already like | came into that camp in 1942, and we were moved from there in the
beginning of 1944. Because, apparently, the Russians were coming in and from
another site, and the Germans were beginning to feel a little bit of war, something

of the war.
What | started saying about this guy, that he actually went with us. We never
knew that we are being taken to Auschwitz. But he was the one that knew, and
he supposedly went to Auschwitz ahead of time to tell them, when it's coming, a
big transport from Pionki, don't kill them, they're very good workers, and if you kill
them we don't -- we need them for the production. Therefore, we kind of thought
that to a certain degree he helped us survive, because it was actually true, when
we came to Auschwitz they didn't take us. Because, if you came to Auschwitz in
those years, they would just take you and send you to the ovens. During most of
the time.
With our transport they did, they took some people that weren't well or older
people, but the young ones they let us go by. So we managed to get like this to
the other place, to Auschwitz.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, when you were sent to Auschwitz was Sam still with
you?
>> Regina Spiegel: Yes. As a matter of fact, we traveled, my husband and I, he
wasn't yet my husband, | want you to know, but after all it's 60-some years and |
am so used to referring to him as my husband, | can't say he is as my friend. But
he was actually my boyfriend at the time. As a matter of fact, when we came into
Auschwitz and they were doing the selection, and he smuggled himself to the -- if
they caught him, he would have been probably like gone, but when we came into

Auschwitz he came running to me. He said -- because he was four years older
than | was. So | think he had much more perception of what this camp looked like
and what it is. He said to me, "Regina, if we ever get out of here," which nobody
ever thought, that once you get to Auschwitz you get out, "Meet me in my
hometown."
| turned around very quickly, "Why not my town? Why yours?"
[Laughter]
You know, when you think back, | know now it's funny, but when you think back
you say to yourself, why did | do that? Why? What got into me to just say this? It
didn't make any sense, because | have no way to know where I'm going to wind
up or what it was. That's what | told him.
For years he couldn't forget it. He said "She's still the same Regina."
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Regina, when the decision was made there that you were
selected for labor, what happened next? What were you forced to do at that
point?
>> Regina Spiegel: At that point, we in Auschwitz, it wasn't yet any work,
because as | say they just brought you to like another station, because | didn't
stay in Auschwitz more than six weeks. But I'll tell you, to be there six weeks is
like being someplace a century, because it was unbelievable.
Men and women were right away separated. That's why | was so wondering that

my husband -- that my boyfriend managed to get over to me. And they puta
name on you. Till then | was known as Regina, Rejina in Polish. They gave mea
name, 4641. This became your name. | will tell you from the minute, from zero,
you had to know that name, that number, because if not they could kill you.

As a matter of fact, we had to strip naked, and | want to tell you | was already 16
years old there, and | never, | never stood in front, especially of a man, naked.
Even | don't think my father ever saw me naked. And they did that to us.
This is the most horrible thing from Auschwitz that | fear, because it took away,
like, our -- you know, like --
>> Bill Benson: Dignity.
>> Regina Spiegel: Exactly. You know, like dignity. It made you feel so, so
horrible. That | had some pictures of my little nephew and of my family, because
we always, whenever we ran we had to run with our pictures, because we wanted
to always have them next to us.
So | held on to this, and this SS man came over to me saying in German "What is
that?"
| really didn't -- | said "Nothing" because | figured what are my pictures going to do
to him? You know? | like to use my hands too much.
[Laughter]
What happened, he took it away, he said "You put it down right here" took all my
pictures away. Nothing. Like left without anything.

We also realized this is a place you better have somebody next to you. So
whoever was standing near me that was getting these numbers became your
buddy. We watched out for one another. When they called my number, and |
once was standing around, looking around, she actually hit me and saying
"Regina, | think they mean you." She already remembered my number, but |
didn't even look at it. | was so -- | was like in another world, like nothing is real.
Because | was in the camp, and this was not like a camp. The whole place was
surrounded by electric barbed wire, double. If you, God forbid, managed to get
through one, you had another one.
Actually, you know what? They were very nice to us. They always encouraged
you to touch the electric barbed wires. But we said to ourselves, "You want us
dead? We'll show you that if we can, we will stay alive." And that was our, you
know, like almost, like you say, the thing to do, because | always felt that nobody
probably Knows what's going on here.
We have to be sometimes here to tell people what was happening, because we
figured if people knew, somebody would have come and say "Hey, what are you
doing with these people?"
But there was no outcry from nobody. We had no help, in a way. We were like
abandoned people.
Finally, | got out there, yes.
>> Bill Benson: You got out after six weeks.

>> Regina Spiegel: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Then you would end up going to other camps. Tell us where you
were sent from there.
>> Regina Spiegel: From there, one was Baumlitz, where they used to make --
most of the places that | was was always something to do with the war, you know,
either stuff to shoot, and actually from Baumlitz we used to work on -- they told us
we have to clean very clean, working on Panzerfaust, because if you leave
anything it can fire back. They used them in the -- they carried them with them.
We occasionally managed, | hope, but we didn't do such a great job. So maybe
something fired back. But | don't know how many.
>> Bill Benson: They told you, though, if any misfired they would consider it an
act of sabotage, right?
>> Regina Spiegel: Absolutely. Anything, to them anything was an act of
sabotage. If you smiled the wrong way, you know, that was an act of sabotage.
You know, like when this guy took away my pictures, you know, he was so near
me, if | probably would have had a gun | probably would have used it on him. But
who had a gun? Who knew -- | wouldn't even know which side, with all of the
ammunition | didn't know which side would shoot first.
>> Bill Benson: Am | right, Regina, that the place where you worked on the
Panzerfaust, which | think was for anti-tank weapons --

wouldn't be bombed, because if you went out on the top, whoever got out, it
looked like a park. It was a park.

some people that were sitting there said to me "Regina, why don't you tell us a

Because the seder teaches us to remember, to remember but to remember from

whatever. Honest to goodness, that's what | remember from Bergen-Belsen.

they paired me up with was -- | Knew her from someplace. | remember she has a

she said, "| found out let me teach you some songs. And if you will sing, you will
find out that your hunger goes away a little bit."

just because | had a problem to find food, but the Russians were moving very fast,
and the Germans tried to -- they still had some Jews to deal with. So they tried to
get rid of us. They actually were supposed to take us to Dachau, either kill us
there or whatever, but on the way the bombs, we were attacked by the United
States and also by other groups, you know, like the British. | didn't even know
that the French were involved in it, because | wasn't there. So whatever you
didn't yourself see, you didn't know that it existed. You know?

running towards these woods. Actually, the Germans there used to tell us, "You

| was thinking to myself, you worked with us so many years, don't worry anymore.
I'll let the Americans take care of me, rather than you. But it didn't work out like
this.
We did run into the woods.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, before you tell us about going into the woods and being
liberated, when your train was bombed there's some significance to the fact that it
was Hitler's birthday.
>> Regina Spiegel: Oh, yes.
>> Bill Benson: Will you tell us about that?
>> Regina Spiegel: That's why they told us, we're going to give you an extra
piece of bread to celebrate Hitler's birthday. He remembers more than | do.
[Laughter]
He said "We will give you an extra piece of bread," but then when they started
really bombing, they forgot about this bread or the water, that they were supposed
to give us, you know, make like a party for Hitler, because they had to run too,
they run away too, because had we known we didn't even have to run. But we
were so afraid that we run into the woods, and we stayed there.
Then we realized we have nothing, we're going to die right here in the woods.
Then | decided to go out. You know, you have always to have one that will do the
first one. So | walked out of the group, and | looked around and in the

background | see a soldier, but he didn't wear a German uniform.
So | ran over to him, | said let me find out. He said "The war is over. You go into
the woods and tell everybody to come out." Apparently, they knew that there
were a bunch of women there, but even though we kept on saying "Be quiet, don't
talk" but you have 500 women in that place, you can't keep quiet, really.
So they knew, but they were afraid, because they thought that maybe there's
some Germans there. So they forget, | don't blame them, the war is over, why get
killed by the Germans? They figured these people will come out. And we actually
did come out. We found out that we are freed by the Russians.
>> Bill Benson: So here you were just coming out of the woods, the Russians say
you're liberated, you're free. What did that mean? What do you do?
>> Regina Spiegel: What do you do? | went into a bakery, and | said to them,
"Can we have some bread?"
And he said to me, in German, | understood a little bit, he said, "Do you have

soldier, he told them "Give these girls some bread." Once he told them, we got
some bread.
Our diet, we didn't need too much. If you had a piece of bread and a little bit of
water, that was our menu. We didn't need any more, because that's what we

were -- that's why a lot of survivors that were actually liberated by the Americans,
and a lot of them died because they started feeding them. With me, with the
Russians, | will tell you truthfully they didn't have too much themselves. So they
couldn't give you -- sometimes they would offer something, but very, very little,
because you could see the way the Russians were dressed, with the shoes, like
pieces of stuff wrapped around their feet to keep warm, because they didn't get
any boots every month or whatever, nothing like being -- whether living in America
or being liberated by Americans. There's no comparison.
>> Bill Benson: Did you decide to go to Sam's hometown or to your hometown?
>> Regina Spiegel: No, as it worked out, | became owner of a horse and buggy.
So we had, instead of walking, you had to walk so much, so we would take turns,
everybody at different times would change. | would walk, somebody else would
move the horse, because the horse didn't have too much food, not from us. So
he couldn't move too much either.

When we actually, we find out we were able to get back, and | did get back toa
train, and | left my horse with the thing on the station, and | was just going to
grab -- because the trains were so full, to go to my town, but all of a sudden
somebody from the other side of the tracks recognized me and yelled out, "Hey,
Regina! Your boyfriend is alive!"
So | said "Where is he?"
He said, "In his hometown, Kozienice." He went back. You see, he ran away

from a death march. So he was closer to Poland, and he was able to get liberated
a little bit before me, | think about a month before me.
>> Bill Benson: So he made it back to Kozienice --
>> Regina Spiegel: Oh, definitely. | made it eventually, | made it to Radom too,
but it was a different story. We were not -- you see, people took over our places,
and they had us, they thought that we would come back and we would take
everything that's ours back. But we never thought of that. Especially | know me, |
never think of things like that.
| figured the people lived there, they probably think it's their home. So they could
have stayed all the time, as long as | was able, | got in touch with an uncle when |
got sick after the war. You know, everybody got sick after the war, because
eventually it started coming, all these goodies to you, and | got very sick, and they
took me to a hospital, and this doctor came in. Again, he offered me a bar of
candy, and | said no. He said "What can | do for you?"

He happened to be in the CIA with the American soldiers already. And he said
"What can | do for you?"
| said "The only thing you can do for me, | have an uncle" -- | have to tell you the
way | pronounced it, New York, New York was Nev York for me, no New York,
n-e-w reads Nev, not New. | told him | have an uncle in New York. He got in
touch with him. Actually, he put an ad in the paper, and he got in touch with him,
and he worked out that we were able to get together, my husband -- my boyfriend

and I, and we came to this wonderful, wonderful country. | love this country from
the minute | stepped my foot into it. It's unbelievable.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, we're going to turn to our audience in a few minutes.
First, when you left the ghetto in Radom to go to Pionki to your sister Hanka, that
was the last time you saw your family. When did you learn what happened to
your family, and did any other family members survive?
>> Regina Spiegel: Well, | will tell you, it didn't take too long to find out what
happened to our family. Most of our families were wiped out. Like in my case, my
full family was taken to Treblinka, and | don't even refer to that camp as, say, as a
camp. It was strictly like a slaughterhouse. They brought there trains, day in and
day night, and everybody disappeared. It's unbelievable. So | never had to
confront my mother.
| used to go on the March of the Living with young people, taking them on the --
which we call it March of the Living, as opposed to March of the Dead, because
they usually had the death march.
| will tell you, it was what a difference. These kids learned so much, when they
saw, and | took a lot of kids. | used to go back. | worked a lot, | don't know, |
always had this thing from the minute, even the museum, even when the museum
wasn't even open, | was already busy, and so was my husband, to help out,
because we thought this is our best salvation, really, to have a place that people

can learn about this thing, what was going on, and hopefully that never anything
like this would happen again.
>> Bill Benson: Regina, are you ready for a few questions from our audience?
>> Regina Spiegel: Oh, I'd love to.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you for raising your hand. We're going to have mics we're
going to try to hand to you. Please use the mic. Make your question as brief as
you can. I'm going to repeat it just to make sure that Regina hears it. You've got
two right here, then one right up here to begin. Here comes a mic to your -- there
you go, to your right.
>> Regina, thank you very much for sharing your story. Did the German officer
who went ahead to Auschwitz, was he ever recognized for what he did for you?
I'm thinking about some of the other --
>> Regina Spiegel: Yeah, | think he should have been. But you know what?
Because he was actually -- they tried to indict him, because he was a higher rank
in the German army, so he probably had maybe other things. But this | say, in
that particular camp he was wonderful, and he had witnesses that came, and they
talked about him, that we didn't know, because we were never private to him. He
never told us "That's what | am doing." But we realized that he, to a certain
degree, saved our lives, a lot of them.

>> Hi, Regina. I'm Calvin. | come from Los Angeles, California. Congratulations
on your entire life, first of all.
>> Regina Spiegel: Thank you. Thank you.
[Applause]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
>> Coming from Los Angeles I've seen a lot of movie stars and athletes, but this
is probably the most star struck I've ever been, truthfully. | wanted to ask, during
your experience moving from camp to camp and seeing everything that you did, |
read that you're from a very religious family. What did that do? What type of
shock waves, if any, did that send through your faith in God?
>> Regina Spiegel: Well -- yeah, | heard you, and | can answer. | will tell you,
truthfully, my faith never changed. You know why? Because basically | never
saw people, you know, | never saw people doing it to me. It was, | assume that
they were bad people. It is otherwise, | never looked.
We couldn't have survived on our own. Because when you think back, in one of
the camps, | will tell you, there was a man that actually my friend, my buddy, and |
-- when they took us out from that camp, we said where are we going to find
another benefactor like this? He left me a piece of apple and a piece of bread
every day. | thought, when | swallowed it, | thought this is going to be the end of
me. But you were so hungry, | forget, | will take a chance. You know, this guy

was not supposed to talk to us, because they were from another country, and
actually they came to work there.

You see, Germany had a lot of work. So they came to work. Not like us. We
were slaves.
Do you know, that that's how we survived, that we had, through the time and very
silently here and there, we had some people helping us. Because, when you sit
down and think, | know | was helped a lot of time. | know. And for that | was very
grateful.
>> Bill Benson: All right, we have a question right here in the second row.
>> Thank you so much for making your story known. | can't understand how you
were able to walk out of the ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: The question is how did you walk out of the ghetto? You were 13
years of age.
>> Regina Spiegel: | know. | know. First of all, | will tell you, my sister, the one
that was in Pionki, she was a dentist. She -- you know, the farmers in Poland
didn't really use that much dentists, because, let's face it, it's very expensive here,
and it was expensive there too. So they didn't go to dentists.
But all of a sudden, who, during the war, really has the best? Young people, you
should be able to answer this to me. The farmers, really, because they have the
stuff that people need during the war. That's all you think is about food, having
food for the kids, having food for your family or whatever it was. So you always

think about food.
So this guy comes into her office, and he said to her, "Rozia," called her by her
first name, "Take a look with my teeth." She said "I will tell you what, it won't cost
you a penny. You just help my sister get out from the ghetto." And that's when he
went, because he said "How I'm going to do that?"
She said "You find a way." Because the one that guarded our ghettos, it might
have been a cousin of his, or a wonderful friend. You know? So you have to
know that this was, in fact, too. So that's how. Because | was never one to run. |

for the five cents the ice cream.
| always loved children. | still love them.
>> Bill Benson: We're going to, | think, close out now. It's time for us to close the
program. I'm going to turn back to Regina in a moment to close the program. But
Regina, you can stay behind for a few minutes, if anybody would like to come ask
Regina another question or just say hi to her when she steps off the stage, please
do so.

>> Bill Benson: Take pictures too. It's our tradition at First Person that our First
Person gets the last word. So | want to thank all of you, then turn to Regina to
close our program.
>> Regina Spiegel: Well, | will tell you, what do | say? | know some of -- you
know, like you talk to the choir, you know, anybody that is here doesn't need my
talk, | think, because they are here for a purpose, and | hope that you learn from
it, you know, that if you -- you know, like if you are angry with somebody, you can
kind of think about it, think about Regina, how she was angry with her mother.
Why? Because she wanted to save me. You know, that's what | mean. From my
saying something, | can tell you what to do, but it's very easy to be good and not
to hate. That's the worst thing. Why did they pick on us?

To this day, if you ask me, | can't figure it out.
My father was a hardworking man. We never gave anybody any troubles, and
they picked us. We were such easy pickings. It was like unbelievable. But that's
why we should be kind to one another, because -- you know what? | believe in
kindness, because you might not love me, but be kind to me. Because somebody
was kind to me, and | always, in my mind, and my children know about this, that
kindness is very, very important.
If you're kind to people, they in turn are going to be kind to you. And that's the
only thing | can give you. I'm not a world renowned speaker, but | feel that this
should be really the main thing, because it's so important in this world, and that

We have to help, something, to do something to help, that nothing like this ever
happens again. And who's that young little lady that sits in the back? Right here
with the long hair. This one. She was awake and listening. I'm surprised.
[Laughter]
What is your name? Juliette? Oh, what a beautiful name! No wonder | noticed
you. Look at her. She looked so intent. She was listening.
