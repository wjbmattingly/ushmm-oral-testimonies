Beginning Tape One, Side A
Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Regina Spiegel, conducted by Margaret Garrett on May 11, 1999 in Silver
Spring, Maryland. This is a follow up interview that will focus on Regina
Spiegel’s post-Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I watched
the videotape of the interview you conducted with the Holocaust eyewitness project
of Washington, D.C. in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotape interview you
conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on March
5‘ 1985. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews.
Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on those interviews
and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A.
What was your name at birth?
Answer: At birth, Regina — Regina Gutman.
Q: And your place of birth?
A: Radom, Poland.
Q: And the date of your birth?
A: It’s — it was May 12", 1926.

Q: — how that happened?
A: Yeah, okay. In — as I spoke previously, from the other tape you probably heard
that on the last part of our journey, so to speak, we found ourselves in — closed up in
cattle trains. They were shipping us, to where we don’t exactly know, but
supposedly, from what we’ve heard after the war, that our journey was taking us to
Dachau.
Q: And you had been where?
A: In Elsnig by Torgau.
Q: Okay.
A: It was our last camp —
Q: Okay.
A: — that we were in.
Q: And we is who?
A: The group, you know, the whole — you know, we were like about 3,000 women.
Q: Okay.
A: So the group, when I speak we, I refer to the — to the whole camp, so to speak.
Q: Okay.
A: They put us on these cattle trains and we were traveling. And in Germany, all of
a sudden we had to stop. And why did we have to stop? Because in Germany the

railroad tracks were bombed. This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to
tell you the truth, didn’t know exactly when, what time it was. But later we found
out that the war was getting — was almost of the brink of being finished, except we
didn’t realize. But when we stopped at our — in our train because the railroad tracks
were bombed, we couldn’t go — excuse me — much farther. So what had happened,
while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey,
you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20", 1945, it’s Hitler’s birthday.
And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it’s Hitler’s
birthday? But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate
it. And no sooner did he finish as the whole sky became black and we were actually
bombed. Our trains were hit by the allies. Not direct, but next to it. And actually, we
were like about 3,000 women, probab — [coughs] excuse me — probab —
Q: You want a cough drop?
A: No, I—I am using a —
Q: Okay.
A: Probably a thousand of us got killed by the bombs, and the rest of us, when this
train split open, and we saw like an opening, the ones who were able to, we just ran
into the woods. We hid out. We couldn’t stay there too long, because after all, they
didn’t give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn’t do a — hide out too much,

and we finally came out and we spotted this Russian — he was like a — probably like
a colonel in the army. And we ran over to him and he said, don’t worry, you are
free. And that’s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly
April 20", because it took us like two days longer. But apparently, the Russians
were already there. I always say, had the Germans left us in that camp, we probably
would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were
liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the
Elbe river.
Q: Excuse me, that makes a sound.
A: Oh yes?
Q: Yeah.
A: Okay. So anyhow, that was mine liberation. So what do you do after you were
liberated? You know, we had thru — in a way, we had a chance, because we could
have — and the Russians were encouraging us to go on a rampage, you know. The
Germans killed us, you go out, you have a chance now, kill the Germans. But you
know what? We decided this wasn’t our way.
Q: Wh-When they were telling you to do this, how did they —
A: The Russians?
Q: Yeah, did you have weapons to —

A: No, we didn’t have weapons, but we could have gotten — they would have been
delighted to give us a — one of their guns.
Q: The Russians would have?
A: Yeah, they would have, but —
Q: So they would have helped you?
A: Definitely. But we decided ourselves that’s no way to go, and we just figured
because we didn’t like what they were doing to us, we would turn around doing the
same thing to them. After all, the German that I would have picked up, I probably
would have never — had never seen him before. It would have been just picking up a
German because he was German. And it — this wasn’t our way. And the next thing
what we started doing 1s let’s go home. Let’s try to get home.
Q: N-Now when you say we, were — who — where — did you have special friends
that you were with?
A: We kind of got — when we were liberated, because we were so used to always
being in groups, like I didn't know how to be by myself.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I-It — so like about 15 girls, we got together and we like di — did things together.
If we wanted to get some bread — because we didn’t have like what the Americans
did on the American zone, a displaced persons camp where they fed you. With the

Russians you didn't have anything like this. The only thing what they did for you,
we would go to them and say take — let’s go to a German bakery with us. And they
would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us. So we —
and we, our type of eating was very crude. Bread and water, that’s all we needed,
you know, to keep us alive. So that’s what we got, we got mostly bread and water.
Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there,
you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households
became empty. Why? Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they
were running towards the American zone. So they left a lot of their homes with no
one there. So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there. I
remember in one place, they had to spe — these beautiful, you know, like fruits,
apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. We were
afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. So we wouldn’t
even touch this. But we would have the bread from the baker and the water and
that’s how we continued going towards Poland.
Q: Now, you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you?
A: Yeah, a Russian soldier.
Q: Yeah. Were all the Russian soldiers helpful to you, or —

A: Mos-Most of the time yes. You see, they didn’t have this type o-of gan —
organization like they had with the — the Americans had. You know, what the
Americans did, they found the survivors, they put them in into a camp and they
supplied food and you had a place where to put down your head. With the Russians
you had nothing like that.
Q: But some Russians 1n some places were abusive to —
A: To women.
Q: To women, and —
A: Definitely.
Q: — did you encounter any of that?
A: A — well, we learned to — to kind of counteract that. Let’s put it this way. During
the day, ess — you know, I told you, we were 15 girls of us. As a matter of fact, we
took out from one of these homes, a horse and one of those — it was like a coach —
not a co — you know, a horse and buggy?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: But it’s not a b — it wasn’t a buggy, it was like the most beautiful si — here at the
Smithsonian [ walked in one time, in front was sitting this coach, you know, it was
the most gorgeous thing if I would have kept it and would — wouldn’t have to had to
worry about any finances because it probably was worth at — a fortune. But we were

traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit. During the day, let’s say where we — if
we were in a certain town during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into
different places to sleep. Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in — in
some kind of — what do they call them, the barns, like. Or the pigs, or some others,
because we were actually very much afraid of — of raping, because during the war,
you see, 1-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because
this was something that they were not allowed to do. If—if a German got caught
raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. So they usually stayed away from us. They
probably were raping more German women.
Q: What — what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women?
A: Oh, that’s was the — what they called the rassenschande. Rassen, the race,
schande is the — a — you know, shame.
Q: Shame.
A: The — the — the race shame, you know, otherwise you — you like committed the
worst sin. I mean, you commit a sin when you rape anybody, but this, th — it wasn’t
the raping that they were worried. So after the war we did have to — the women, and
I don’t — we got away — we got away kind of lucky, but a lot of women weren’t that
lucky.
Q: It sounds as though you also were careful.

A: Very, very, as I say. You see, when I was liberated in ’45, I was already almost
like 19 years old. You know, through the war years, you became very adept, let’s
put it this way, and like self preservation.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So most of us were really looking out for these things. When we notice 1n a town
that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out
on — you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that town. We would
march on. We -— like I said, we had this horse and buggy, so we could move on a
little bit more. And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in
Germany. You know, they came to Germany to work. And they were also like
trying to get back. So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a —
with another man, they would just stay away from you.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with
them.
Q: The Italian guys.
A: Mm-hm. And then we just lost them. Came to another town, we looked around
what was bat — we were very much aware, and I’m really surprised — you probably
heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really, that

question, how — because we were — were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian
soldiers.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So anyhow, after — to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the Polish
border, I really don’t know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three
weeks. First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very —
from the bombs, she was a little bit more in — and sh-she — you know, like she lost a
couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. You know, like I had a
little bit of a 1-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? A piece of shrapnel got into my
hand, but it wasn’t — you know, I never felt it. You know, it wasn’t dangerous for
me. But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. So she actually stayed in the
hospital. We couldn’t, you see, we couldn’t keep on staying in the same town for
too long because we were actually afraid of this. So we actually had to leave her in
the hospital, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her. So she
was like more or less taken care of. But we kept on going and probably took us
probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border. And when I got
there — and you know, as you were walking — you see, when we were liberated,
would you believe that most of us didn’t realize that most of our families were
murdered? We still were hoping that maybe somebody’s gonna be alive because I

will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that’s what kept us through all
the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another,
we would have given up. But that was, in a way, kept us — hey, you stay alive
because you promised that we’re gonna meet at home. You know, like my
boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate — when they
separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me
in mine hometown. But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we
were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us
all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated —
you see, never thinking that what’s going to happen, that it’s going to be this mass
killing, but just separated. If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she
says, remember, after the war, we’ll meet in our place, you know, in our home. So
naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back home. So I did. That’s how
— and most of us —
Q: Back to Radom?
A: Back to Radom, but by the time when I hit the Polish border, it was the city
Poznan. That was like on germ — Polish German border. I don’t know whether —
you know, I think it’s not any more Poznan, I think they call it now Wroclaw,
because this became part of Germany, you know, ne — I think so they call it

Wroclaw, I’m almost sure. Or maybe it’s still there, I haven’t looked at the map.
Maybe after I finish this interview I will take a look at the map.
Q: Okay.
A: But we got to this town Poznan, and when I got to Poznan, the trains in Poland
were running already. Because you see, Poland was actually liberated in °44,
towards the end of ’44, th — 1t — the beginning of ’45. So their trains were already
running. They weren’t maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by
the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs. And I dropped — I will
never forget this, I drove — I — I didn’t drive, how do you call it? I brought this horse
and buggy on the station and left it there just like that because actually, we were 15
girls, no one wanted to go near the horse. I said to them, you went through such a
war. You’re afraid of a little horse? I mean, he was that — he probably w-wa — I
wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and — other
than with the people. I said, and you’re afraid? So they were afraid to go near the
horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, I was the one that took him in — now I
probably wouldn’t know how to deal with it, but at the time, you know, when your
life is at stake, or whatever it is that you have, I came to the conclusion that human
nature, you would do what you have to do for survival.
Q: And had you had any experience with a horse before?

A: lwas a—I wa—I was a city girl.
Q: — handle — so you didn’t know anything about handling a horse?
A: Never. Never in my life —
Q: But you learned fast.
A: — did — did I go close to a horse, but I didn't know — you see, now I know a horse
can kick you or something. I didn’t even know a horse can do that to you. But I
knew that it was the only way that if we wanted to get back to Poland, rather than
walking step by step. And that was also a lit — a little bit in our way, that we had this
mobility a little bit, that when we realized that this town isn’t so safe for us. I mean,
not with our lives, but with our — you know, virginity.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So we figured we better keep on using it. And that’s what I did, so I left in
Poznan, somebody had a very good deal on me, left in Poznan this gorgeous,
gorgeous thing, with the horse. And of course, then we start — got on that train, no
tickets. I don’t know where [indecipherable] going [indecipherable] going to the
trains, you know, on the outside, because we had no money.

Q: Did they require that you had ticket — have a ticket if you were a returning
refugee?
A: They might have. You want to know something but — there were so many people
in the trains that probably the conductor could never manage to get them that — to
go and ask him for anything because you just got on the train and you hopped off
wherever it stopped. And then how we stopped in one place, and somebody passes
me by, and he actually had walked away already and came running back. He said
Reginka(ph) to me. He recognized me, we were in one of the camps together in
Pionki, you know, that was — we were the only camp where men and women
worked together, but I was. And he says hey, you know that your boyfriend is alive?
That’s when I found out that Sam was alive. So I already felt a little bit better
because I felt I — it’s true, ’'m going back into my city and I’m going to look for my
family, but at least my boyfriend is alive. Because by the time we were getting to
Poland, the closer we were getting, we realize more and more that our families
were dead, but we still couldn’t accept it.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: In a way it reminds me a lots of times when God forbid, you have a very si —
terrible sick spouse, and you know he’s gonna die, or she’s gonna die, 1 — you just
don’t want to accept it. And I think that was with us, you know, now that I’m — I

never thought of it then, but hi-1 — but now that I’m older, I put — I can think a little
bit differently than I did in those years. And I think most of us didn’t want to accept
the idea that everybody was dead. So you clung to it. But at least, as I say in my
case, at least I knew my boyfriend, if he behaves himself and if he is waiting for me,
and if he thinks of me as much as I think of him, maybe we’|I be able to get
together. So finally I got to my city, Radom. To tell you the truth, when I got there,
I don’t know exactly, but — have you ever been to Europe?
Q: Yes. Not to Poland, but other parts.
A: Yeah, but you know like other, like bel —
Q: Czechoslovakia, Hungary.
A: — bel — it would be the same thing.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: You know how before you walk in into the places where you actually lived, you
walk into a big gate?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Yeah, and then you go into the courtyard. Well, I did that. I came to my place
where I used to live, it was called Jerome Skakel(ph) 21. This street was Jerome
Skakel(ph), he was a Polish writer, the name of the street, was actually the main
street of the city and the number of the building was 21, and a— I walked in. And no

sooner did I go in, I haven’t even — because we lived a little bit farther into the
place, and I had this idea that I was going to walk in into my place, knock on the
door, because by then I really knew already that most of our — my family was dead.
And I — but I figured I will knock at the door and just ask it. Tell them who I am.
Maybe if somebody else from my family comes and ask — tell him that the sister is
alive. And I was also going to ask him, you know what? I lost all my pictures in
Auschwitz, and it always bothered me that here I lived through it and I don’t even
have a picture to look at it. You know, it’s — 1t seems so funny, because when you
have access to it, 1-1t really isn’t that important, but I hear more and more people
when their homes are on fire or something they run back. For what do they run
back? For their pictures. And the same thing I thought maybe when we left for the
ghetto. My mother couldn’t take everything. I’m sure she took some pictures, but
she prob — maybe she left some pictures and maybe these people would have those
pictures. That wouldn’t mean anything. But no sooner did I walk in into that place,
you know, walked through this back gate, somebody caught me and said
Reginka(ph). Reginka(ph), by the way, is a name for — like Regina. It’s — in Polish
you use it like a diminutive, yeah. Say hey, Reginka(ph), what are you doing here?
They just shot Gudsztat(ph), otherwise a neighbor of ours, came back. He came
back maybe a month before. They used to have a jewelry store before the war, and

he took back the jewelry store. I mean, the Russians weren’t yet in Poland like later
on they came in. As it was, later on it didn’t make any difference because the
Russians took away from it. But he took back the jewelry store that belonged to his
family. Somebody came, knocked at the door, that same time that I came in into our
city, and killed him. And this girl grabbed me, she says, let — g — run. And she and
me started running. And where do we run? There’s no place where to run. We run
into where the ghetto used to be in Radom. They had — they made like out of a
warehouse, they made like almost like a — a — what they call a — a community
center, you know, so when — because so many people were coming back into the
city and they had no place where to go. So at least you should be able to put down
your head and what we used to do, in a place like this, we would — they would have
like sheets of paper on the walls, and you would put in your name. So at least I felt
like — so I put down my name, and — Regina Gutman, am — you know, so maybe if
somebody will look through, they will find me or if they know [indecipherable] of
course, nobody found me except my boyfriend by then already heard that I got back
to Radom and I —

A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: You know true, I always say it’s amazing. We didn’t have telephones, we didn’t
— but through the way — through the grapevine, you know. People were walking.
The people were walking, 1-it was like the march of the masses. People were
walking from Radom to Germany. People were coming from Germany into
Radom. So as you were walking, you met some people, and we had a way to
identify ourselves, to — to ask you, let’s say if I pass by somebody that I thought that
looked a little bit familiar but I wasn’t too sure, I would just address him as
amho(ph). You know, just go by amho(ph). And this was almost like our password.
It’s a Hebrew word for — like folks. You know, a country —
Q: Folks?
A: Yes. A— maybe I’ll ask Sam a — a better definition of, because he speaks
Hebrew much better, but amho(ph). So if — if he heard the word amho(ph), he
realize that I’m Jewish too. Do you know — of course, we were plenty identifiable in
the beginning anyhow. I — all right, I didn’t wear any more mine suit what I had
what — when I was liberated, my striped suit, because this I got rid of at the first
thing. The minute I got in into a German house — I told you I wouldn’t touch the
food, but I looked around in their clothing and whatever the clothing was, I got rid

of that because I just couldn’t seem myself walking through in this striped suit.
Because if you saw somebody in that striped suit, you knew, more or less that they
were Jewish. But this what we had, you know, in order to identify ourselves. So
people, you started and the minute you knew that he was Jewish too, you stopped it.
Where you coming from? I am from here. Did you see anybody? And that’s how we
got a little bit, you know, like information. Like this, and Sam probably found out
through this way that also that I was alive. And as a matter of fact, I didn’t even
stay, that same night I was going to spend the night in that center, but I found a
cousin of mines who actually was already there. She just came down to see who
else was coming, because she actually was able to take back her apartment. She
came back with a stepmother and she, when she saw me, she said, don’t stay here,
you can come and stay with us in our apartment. So I went with her in the
apartment. Was a little bit — much more comfortable to stay there, and that’s what it
was. And then of course, Sam and — Sam found out that I was alive, he sent for me.
He got somebody with a horse and a buggy, because that’s what it wa-was basically
the mode of transportation, you can still see it over there. And I went to Kozienice.
Q: Now how far was that from Radom?
A: It probably was maybe, at the most I would say like maybe 30 - 40 kilometers.
Q: Okay.

there, but we didn’t. But we did have to walk a little bit because if the horse needed
go up on a hill, we had to go down and push the hor — push the whole thing because

Q: So what was that like for you to be in the horse and buggy on your way to meet
Sam?
A: I-It was — I would tell yo — you know what? It was so natural, you know, like I
didn't even think about it that it was a — I was just hoping, because I hadn’t seen him
yet, that he hadn’t lost the — the love for me, so to speak. But 1-1t was like
adventurous in a way, you know.

A: Exactly.

A: And I — it was — e—e —I met him in 1942, in — in that camp, and this was

know, you didn’t grow too much in camps, you know, because they didn’t — so I
was about the same size, you know, what I was. I mean the height I was about the
same size. I was still pretty skinny, but it’s amazing. I — you know, when I survived,
I weighed 69 pounds.

A: Yeah — yes. I-It’s a lots of times when my husband and I, we would talk to one
another, e-even with other survivors, we just can’t figure out how we even managed
to survive even after the war, because we had no money. You know, we lived like
homeless people. Really, when you — when you think — except our brain worked
pretty good, that was the only thing. But really, how we managed to get through day
after day with nothing, really, til of course when I finally caught up with Sam, he
ordered the head — we were like a little business in Poland.
Q: You and Sam?
A: Yeah. Not me, he did, because when I came, he already had it. He put a — but he
will probably tell you, he put a mill that belonged to a friend of theirs, a flour mill
into working. And he started using that mill as making flour. And the Polish people
would bring in the — the wheat to make flour from it and all of a sudden when I
came there to Kozienice, I didn’t have to go to requisition bread because all of a
sudden I had money to go out and buy a bread. But really til then, I can’t figure out,
because it took us at least, by the time I caught up with him, it was like, I would

then we decided one day that we couldn’t stay in Poland, because it was really very
dangerous, you know. I don’t know whether you Jewish or not, you know, I never
ask people, but it’s very hard for me to even tell this, because I-I feel almost
ashamed. And mind you, what I went through, believe me there were plenty times
where they tried to make me to be ashamed of being Jewish, or whatnot. But I
almost feel ashamed that I lived in a culture where coming back after such a
horrible, horrible war, that our neighbors truly didn’t want us. Not only didn’t they
want us, they were really willing to almost go out and kill us. So my boyfriend and I
decided one day, what the heck, w-we can’t stay here, they gonna kill us. We have
to get out. And we — he — we got up one morning, like maybe five o’clock in the

another train next to us, and it was still summertime, so the windows were open, I
hear somebody is talking and I turned around to Sam, I said Sam, you know what?
The other train, people speak, it sounds like Polish, but it isn’t Polish. Maybe we’re
in Czechoslovakia. And you know what we did? We didn’t think too much. We
had this little, little suitcase, we took this little suitcase, we got out from this train,
climbed underneath the trucks, through the other train, walked in and into the other
train, sat down. The train — the next time the train stopped, we were in — in Prague,
Czechoslovakia. So we were breathing already a little bit lighter. As a matter of
fact, I loved Czechoslovakia. I wanted to stay there in.

A: You know what? When we were there, their president came back from Russia.
Apparently during the war he escape to Russia, and he came back. And I watched,
for the first time in my life, I watched the people of Prague, the way they were
greeting their president. They were hanging out from their windows and they were —
with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president,
that’s how much I knew about — you know, it somehow — I always say, with g — all
going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna,
what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other
people. So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned
around to say, they must be wonderful people. I never knew about Czechoslovakia
except what I learned in the history books. I mean, after all, when the war broke out,
I was 13 years old, how much did I learn about other countries, you know? But I
always was — loved, you know, geography and history. So I knew a little bit about
them, but I didn't know about them, but I didn't know about nature of people. But
when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here. But you
know why we didn’t? We probably wouldn’t mind. Because we heard that you had
to be born there in order to become a citizen — to be a citizen. Otherwise, if you
weren’t born there, you never become a citizen. So we were worried. What if it
comes in something changes, we’re the first ones to be shipped out like they did in

Germany, to a lot of Jews in Germany, because if they weren’t from Germany,
they shipped them out. And by then, little by little we found out that the Americans
were there. And also they — we got co — some people contacted us. You know, they
picked us up, we were wondering how do they recognize, but it was easy to
recognize us.
Q: Well, who were the people who picked you out?
A: It was people that worked for the Jewish Distribution Committee, which 1s called
the Joint. And a lot of them were working also for what was then Palestine, and
they were trying to get together the refugees, you know. And then they took us
actually on a— on a bus, it was an American bus, a transport — er, later on — what
I’ve heard lately, that because people were coming back and they gave — you know,
like to Truman, you know, when Truman became president, that they gave him
news that for the Jews in Poland it’s so bad that s-something has to be done, that
they should be able to get out of there. So I— I understand that he actually saw to it
that some of the borders were opened. You know here, right, we thought that we did
such a act that we were able to smuggle ourselves into the other country so easy, but
it — apparently this was maybe already as a fact. And we were taken from there, we
were taken on a bus into Germany.

that’s was our idea that whatever do — we do, we don’t want to stay in any other
country, except go to Palestine, because we already had being in other countries. So
that’s what we wanted to do, and the next thing we knew, we came into this, like
what they called it later, displaced persons camp. It was called Foehrenwald, which
was near Wolfratshausen. It was like about 15 kilometers from Munich. And it’s
very interesting because later on I found out that Dachau was near Munich and

Dachau. So I said, here I came on my free will, practically — not to Dachau but

got a job, he was working in the office. It was run by the UNRRA. Have you ever
heard of UNRRA?
Q: Oh yes.
A: You probably did.

we all stayed together in that house. So we wind up that my former brother-in-law

much food, that you started worrying you might be getting too fat, because basically
the food — and a lot of the food we weren’t used to it, that — but like they gave us
tuna fish, we never knew what tuna fish was, we’d — when — we’ve never seen it.
They gave us powdered milk, we never saw it. But later on, it’s amazing how you
learn. I found out that if you mix the powdered milk, you — you know, the powder
with water, it becomes like milk. So we made cheeses out of it. It’s amazing. We
used to make delicious cheese. I wish I could get it now.

because when I got up the first thing in the morning when my eyes opened, I would
wash my hands and say a prayer thanking God for making me get up tha — to be

Q: Did your parents encourage that?
A: Well they — they must have because they sent me to a — a religious type of
school.
Q: Mm-hm.

that was a — I was absolutely crazy about her and she happened to be from that
school. So I would like follow her. She influenced me a lot. But of course, during
the war a— you know, we’re keeping, you know, with Jews you keep kashrut, you
know, it’s very important. And I will never forget the first time when I came to live
with my sister, and my sister knew how religious I was, she wanted to get me used
to — a little bit to a— not to be so picky, you know, like it’s alright to eat something
else if you don’t have everything that it’s kosher.

Did — I thought because in the city where she lived, I knew she couldn’t get it. I
said, did you get it from home? Did my parents send it to you? Because she used to
always get somebody to get in touch with my parents and she was able to manage to
do this. And she said — I could see the minute she started explaining to me, because
she figured it’s time to get me used to it, when she saw how much I enjoyed it. She
says, well, in — nota — the minute she — she didn’t even —

A: No.
Q: You didn’t.
A: I didn’t, because at that time I probably would have still would refuse to have it.
But she wanted to show me that you can stay alive even if you eat it. I used to think
if you eat something non-kosher that you die. So the minute she says we-ell, I said
oh-oh. And no sooner did she say it, like everything came out of me, you know, I
started throwing up. But of course, little by little I got used to what they fed me,
believe me. That didn’t make any difference. So — but one thing I must say, I am,
even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be. I believe in God. I believe I
am — I like to go to shul, we work for the synagogue, you know, I believe very
much in Jewish education for the children and you know, for everybody. I worked

Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, because I was always
interested in Jewish education. However, I am not as religious or adherent to the
kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then. Because I found out that you can
live and it doesn’t have to be everything exactly kosher. And — and besides, I
myself — had maybe my parents lived through, I would have kept it on for them,
because somehow older people stick much more to it. Even the survivors, the older
survivors. But a lot of people like me that went through the war, are not as — they
believe in God, but they don’t believe that the — the meat has to be slaughtered a
certain way in order to be a good Jew or something like this. So no, this they
definitely changed me this way. But as far, they couldn’t kill the spark for Judaism
and I don’t know why it’s whether because I was so young that it really — like it,
like went above me. I-It didn’t touch me as much. I always say, when you were a
young kid, you don’t have the — the bonds with your family are not yet so complete
that you can cope with — with these thing a little bit better than let’s say, older
people. I always say that had my sister survived, let’s say you know, my sister
actually had a choice, you know, she didn’t have to go with her baby. They actually
wanted her to say that this baby isn’t mine. Because you see, they needed her in the
— in the camp. They liked to staff the camp with the doctor, a dentist. By then, when
they were taking my sister out, they had killed off most of the doctors and the

dentists and whatnot. So they had to go look for somebody. So they actually didn’t
want her to leave. They actually encouraged her to say no, this is not my baby. But
of course she wouldn’t do it. And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she
had to live with something like this. I mean, you can’t do that. So as far as I was
concerned, it’s true I was raised very, you know, in a way you would have been
Orthodox, but not to the point where, like I have some Orthodox neighbors here.
You know, they walk around with their hats, and their — you know, th-they call
them the payos in — in Jewish, I don’t know —
Q: Dreadlocks?
A: What are they?
Q: Dreadlocks?
A: I don’t know whether it is the dreadlocks, but th-the kids, you know and their
garment has these little things outside. And my father never wore anything like this,
and — he used to wear a hat, but nothing identifying him as a — as being a Jew,
because he could have wear only a hat, like anybody else, you know. Poland was
pretty cold, so most of the time you had to wear a hat. But — and my mother didn’t
shave her head, she had her own hair. So we weren’t that strictly Orthodox, we were
a fairly Orthodox. Like here, you would have considered us Orthodox.

Judaism, this they couldn’t kall.
Q: Tell me about loving Judaism.
A: Tell you. You know what? I often think that if I had a choice, if they would have
approached me — of course, I shouldn’t say this because it’s my thinking, you know,
because I was never approached, but had I been approached to — that somebody
would want to take me out and that’s all I had to do is take over another religion, I
don’t think I would have done it. Now, I don’t say — I couldn’t swear to it, because I
was never asked. But I always felt very strong about being Jewish. Even while I
was in camp. You know, we had a incident in ones of the camps. It was right after

want to fast, you don’t have to take the piece of bread now. We will give it to you in
the evening. And we figured, you know we never trusted them. We figured that
they’Il probably never give us the bread. But you want to know something? It was
amazing, I would say that 95 percent of the inmates in that camp chose not to take
that piece of bread, once we knew that it was Yom Kippur. If they had given it to
us, we didn’t know that 1t was Yom Kippur, but once we knew it — so you see, I
think it wasn’t only me. I think most of us had this spirit. And I don’t know whether
it was our — like self preservation or we felt like, you think so great, look what you
doing to us. What am I gonna become, like you? I don’t want to be like you. So ee —

you could find him for me, that would be great. So he got the name and would you
believe that this guy put an ad in the Forwards, in the Jewish paper and looking —
telling that a niece is looking for a Mr. Sa -- Zeismann(ph) Kreps(ph). Well, my
uncle never read the Forwards, because he read the “Wall Street Journal.” But
there was somebody here in Washington that knew my mother, she was also from
Radom, that came here before the war. She knew ma-my mother and she knew my
uncle and she called him to New York to say, did you see a niece is looking for
you? And he was the one that send me papers to come, and my papers were made
out not only for me, they were made out whoever is with me, because my uncle
figured that if I survived, maybe there was somebody else that survived. But of
course, nobody else survived, so I — I always tell him, you know, when I talk to the
kids, they get a bang out of this, I tell them, you know, I turned around to my
boyfriend, I said, if you marry me, you know you have a ticket to the United States
and never — nobody ever refuses that. And they think that’s very funny, but that
wasn’t it, but you know, I had the papers and I was able to bring Sam with me. So

care of us. They saw to it that we got in line to get to the ship, you know, because it
was very terrible that time, you know, they only allowed a certain amount of
people. The — the immigration laws were very, very strict in this country. You had
to go through — I mean, like your health and everything. If you were running a little
bit, a grade over, one grade over a fever, one point over what they thought it’s
supposed to be, you were sent back. And nobody wanted to stay in Germany. I was
sitting in Germany just waiting and — and the little suitcase what I had, just didn’t
want to even unpack. I — I was just ready to go because I started telling you, we
were hoping to go to Palestine, but in those years — you still have time?
Q: Yes.
A: In those years you couldn’t go into Palestine because they had the — the British
put up a blockade so you couldn’t bring in the refugees, the only ones they had to
smuggle them through. So once I got married, they figured we are already taken
care of, you know, the — the — the people from Palestine that were taking care, they
tried to take in the kids that had nobody, that they were single. So to give them a
life. So — and since we were married and of course by then we had already the
papers to come to the United States, so they let us alone and they said no, we can’t

A: We got married actually in May 21%, 1946.

A: We came in — to the United States in November of 1947.
Q: So you’d been married a year and a half.
A: Mm-hm, yeah.
Q: Now previously you said that you and Sam wanted to go to Palestine. How did
you feel that it was working out more easily and practically that you come to the
United States?
A: Because, you know, you learn to compromise. We really wanted to come to — to
go to Palestine, because like I told you before, we figured we’ve had enough of
different countries where 1-1f they decide they don’t like us, they can say go. So we
figured we’ll go to Palestine, but since it became very difficult for us to go, they
absolutely told us no way that we will be able to go because first of all, we were
getting already, little by little, as time went on, we were getting older. We’d gotten

that?
A: No, because originally, I start to tell you —

Washington. And besides, you see, I had a brother that I — lived in Washington.

A: He came — he smuggled himself into this country in 1939. And when the United
States declared war, he became — he fought in the American army. So after the war,
they shipped him back to the United States. But he found out that one of his sisters
was alive, he didn’t know which one, and he came back. He had e-enlisted back into
the army as a translator because by — he spoke German and by then he already knew
English. So they shipped him back to Germany, and that’s when he came back. We
actually would have gotten married a little bit before, but when I heard that he was
coming back to Germany, I said I wanted to have my brother at my wedding. And
we actually have a picture of my brother at our wedding. But he has passed away

right away we were able to converse with them in German. So — because at that
time we still spoke a little bit German, now our — my German 1s very rusty. I still

survivors, you didn’t have to learn to speak English, because you could get along on
Yiddish — on Jewish, because mo-most of the people that had the little businesses or
whatever, you got a job, they were speaking Jewish. And the survivors that you met
together, you — they were speaking Jewish or Polish. So we really didn’t — they
didn’t need it. But here in Washington, because we had very few survivors in this
area that’s came from — spoke Polish, you know, so we di — really, we’re like forced
to — to — y-you have to learn or — or sink. And we did. A-And we didn’t like — I bet
you it didn’t take us less than six months that we were able to make ourselves
understood. And most people, that’s why I always say that the American people are
so wonderful, you know, especially in those years. I will tell you 1-1 — later on I was
thinking to myself how — you know, my English was so bad and yet they tried so
hard. They wouldn’t [indecipherable] from me or anything like that, a-and they
tried so hard to like stop and listen to me what I had to tell them or something, you
know. So 1-1t — it really was a pretty — as far as I was concerned, a very pleasant
experience. You see, you have to realize, it’s one thing when you come to a country
when you leave your family at home. You miss them, let’s face it. If I would have
had my whole family in powl — Poland, and I would have come here, I was a young
woman and so was my husband, I would have found it, very probably, disturbing.
But coming from where we came, with nobody, I had nothing to look back to.

Q: Did you think a lot about what you had come from?
A: All the time. And you want to know something — but it was interesting to hear
once my kids telling me the same thing, what I always thought it’s — you know, the
minute the war was over, I almost became back like this little girl, except minus the
kashrut, this little girl that left home — that was taken from home, that I was forced
out of from home. I-It was always, whatever I did, it was always as if my parents,
especially my mother, as if she was standing in the back of me and like guiding me.
And saying no, you — you shouldn’t do that, or yes, you could do that. And it was
interesting, so help me, I’m not making this up, but my daughter, I have three girls
and my middle one was always like a little bit of a rebel. And she had gone to
Israel for — you know, like for a summer package deal for five weeks. And she
came back and you know, I started asking her question, what did you do or
something, but she says, Mother, you don’t have to worry, it was always — while I
was in Israel, it was always as if you were standing right in the back of me, so help
me. And I said to my — you know, I don’t know, 1s that’s how life goes on, the
cycle? I said, you know what? That’s how I was thinking when I was without my
parents. I was thinking that they were in the back of me.

A: It wasn’t a question what she was telling me, It was a question what you were
learning from — from them, what they were doing. You always knew that you
shouldn’t harm anybody, that you — you should be kind to other people. You always
knew that cert — certain things you just didn’t do. She didn't have to spell it out to
me. I mean, I knew what was expected of me. She didn’t just sit me down on my —
on my — which, I used to sit on her lap a lot because I was the youngest one in my
family, so — a-and she used to like how a —I was 13 years old, I remember she used
to keep me — when she hold me on her lap like — like I do sometimes with my
grandson who is three or five years old. One five, and one three. I’m just saying.
But she kept me like — almost like a baby, you know. But I always remember my
mother as being the kindest person that ever lived. And you want kn-kn-know
something? If I should have any legacy, even to my children, I always think of it,
my children should remember me the way I remember my mother. But of course I
lived much longer, so they probably might not, you know, because — you know, as a
child you — I mean, how much harm could I do? But I-I had certain values that I
knew that I mustn’t overstep. A — in — like a—a living with a — with a boyfriend, I
knew that was wrong and you just don’t do it.

A: Not — n-not — not at that time, not at that time, but later on, when we decided to
do get married in [indecipherable] in the displaced persons camp — because you
see, while we’re struggling around still in Poland, it was very hard to do that
because we were constantly thinking that we’re not going to stay there, definitely,
because if not [indecipherable] Sam definitely would have gotten killed, because
we even heard that somebody was trying to do that. Somebody warned us, and we
knew we had to get away from there. And then, when we got to Germany, but then
heard that my brother was coming, so I told my husband — because I could have
gotten — we had plenty witnesses in the — in the Foehrenwald, in the displaced
persons camp, but I said Sam, how can I get married? I-I have only one brother. I
have to wait for him. So that’s why we waited a little bit longer, but we could have
gotten, actually, in a way — I always tell my kids, 1-1-1t — it took years til I told them

of fact when I came to New York and I met my uncle, and it’s interesting, because
when my uncle came to pick us up and he was looking around, you know, we were
— when we got off the ship and we were in — in this big hall with — there must have
been thousands of people, I picked out my uncle. I never saw him alive. The man
looked exactly around his eyes like my mother. I said, that must be him. I never
even saw a picture of him — I didn’t remember. I’m sure I must have seen it, but you
know, a kid looks at a picture of some uncle that lives in New York that she never
saw, didn’t pay any attention. But I picked him out. I walked over to him, and sure
enough it was my uncle. But my uncle was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in
Manhattan. Had one of the finest tailor shops in Manhattan, he and a partner.
They used to make clothing for J. Edgar Hoover. I mean, in those years when we
came over to this country, my uncle’s suits used to cost like about f — between 500
and seven - 800 dollars. I mean, unbelievable. Everything was handmade. So when
I came — and of course I found my uncle, he showed me how to use an electric
sewing machine, I never used it. So when I came to Washington, I already knew
how to use an electric sewing machine, so I knew, so I actually got a job right away
at that place here, and then I switched to another place and I worked til my daughter

papers, my — I mean, I — I was already put into so many categories, I didn't like to
be. So I wer — resented her. But because I felt like, if you want to write about your

you’re entitled to it. But don’t say that all the survivors’ kids — because when you

a little bit, but you can’t help a kid unless they can help themselves. They all — most
of them are professionals, or if they are not, they do something, they’re really very
worthwhile citizens. And the way she put in that book — but this book that she went
on this journey, I think she must have come to terms with her mother or whatever,
because she went to find from where she came and she found out that her mother
wasn’t such a horrible person, and she made that up, that she was, in her mind she
assumed that because her mother, you know, maybe didn’t do certain things for her,
that she figured all the kids of survivors are no good. So I had a little bit of a
problem, but no, I — as a matter of fact, I would love to get ahold of that book. They
— they had a write-up about this book in one of the — I think maybe “Newsweek”
magazine or in one of them. And I read it, but there wasn’t so much written, but I
always wanted to get this book out and read about it, because for the only reason
that I wanted to read it, because I wanted to change my mind about this Helen
Epstein. So this — I had my own little beef with her, that I felt like, don’t put all
survivors there, just like I’m not going to put that all survivors get a ba — as a matter
of fact, I think the survivors’ kids tried so much harder.

A: — in the beginning — I’m not saying now, before people found out what had gone
— was going on. And — but my family was very nice to us. They accepted us the way
we were, with our broken English, and maybe that helped me a little bit look on
things with a little bit rosier glasses. And I had wonderful friends. Not only the
survivors, the others. I-I had some very intelligent friends. As a matter of fact one
just left for Hungary and — and she lives in Austin, Texas now and she just left for
Czechoslovakia and Hungary. And she called me before she left, she wanted me to
know, because she knew that I will enjoy hearing from her, that she 1s going to visit
these two countries that had such also tragedy, you know, with the Jewish people.
And some others, very inter — I used to always like oh, I had one friend, she — they
live now in Florida. And I used to always say, oh Mildred, I wish I was intelligent
as you are, as educated. She says, Regina, you’ve got more education, in a way,
that any of us could ever get. You have life education. You we — I — I listen to you
sometimes when you talk. I like to hear and I like to take your [indecipherable]
advice, because you — we always know that you won’t steer us the wrong way. So
don’t look at it that way. Think of yourself that you are very important. So they
always try to build me up, but it wa — so maybe that’s why I always had a little bit a
—a better outlook on things, because I think when you being, you know, all right,
we were kicked around plenty ee — oh — in Europe, over there. But when I came

here and I wasn’t kept on being kicked around, I kind of like — it was almost like
my healing process. So I figured hey, I belong back to the human race, or something
like this.
Q: How do you take the situation over in Yugoslavia currently?
A: Mm-hm, well, it’s — for awhile there, you know, I thought oh my goodness, the
world just sitting back and doing nothing. But I will tell you, the way I look at it
now, I — that the world has learned a little bit from us. It’s true that we paid a very,
very big price, because let’s face it, nobody, nobody gave us a hand or anything. It’s
a matter of fact, not only didn’t they give us a hand, they put stumbling blocks, you
know, in our way. No — a-—I told you we were — we were rescued by — by railroad
tracks that were broken. They could have done that, the same thing in Auschwitz.
Like we used to sit in Auschwitz and think of it when we would see a plane fly by,
we would say, why can’t they send a plane and just drop a couple bombs? Not on
us, we didn’t want to get killed, but just on the railroad tracks, to slow them down.
Just slow them down. But never happened. So I feel that the world, in a way, has
learned a little bit [indecipherable]. But it also, as bad as it is, and believe me, no
matter what child gets killed, for whatever reason, 1t doesn’t make any different, it’s
still somebody’s child that it’s killed and it — no reason. But you know, in — in
Yugoslavia it was a completely different story. People wanted territory. They wa —

they wanted — but with us they didn’t gain that they have — if they killed those
people they will gain something. With us, they — they wi — had no gain with us. The
only gain they got that maybe they — they stole some pictures or some art or some
money or something like this. But basically by — by displacing us, or killing us, they
didn’t gain anything by it, it was just for the sake of killing. But of course, I don’t —
you know, I don’t like to see what it’s going on there.
Q: Just — do you think more about what happened to you during this period? What
everything —
A: Well, when I — when I see in the paper I always — I kind of compare how
everybody’s aware what’s going on there, as compared to those years that nobody
supposedly knew what was going on except in the high hierarchy, you know. But
the ee — ee — I’m always concerned what was go — what’s going on in this world. I
think it’s — it’s —1— the minute it affects any human being, it affects me too, to a
certain degree. But as far as do I remember more what had happened to me when I

you ask me how did you think, you know. Look my sister and she was older and she
might have known that we’re into much more trouble than I did. Sh — when I saw

says, I can’t do it. She — it’s for — it was my parents’ first grandchild. She says, I
can’t to it. And they couldn’t even come to the city because they were already in the
ghetto in Radom and they couldn’t come. But she still couldn’t bring herself to do
something against my parents’ wishes. I don’t say look, I-I-I’m not going to say had

Spiegel, I changed the subject when you started to talk about your children and
what it was like for you to have children and grandchildren.
A: Mm-hm, well to have my children, it was really a wonderful feeling. All of a
sudden I realize that what he started out to do, Hitler, he wanted to really eliminate
the Jews, and here were two survivors, we have three wonderful daughters, they’re
married and we have eight grandchildren. And this is our really immortal less — like
our revenge to Hitler. You wanted to do away with us. Look, we’re here. And
they’re all going into — you know, let’s put it this way, I’m very proud of my kids.
They are going in the footsteps, so to speak, of their forefathers. You know, like
they’re all very active in organizational work, do a lot of — for their synagogues. My
son-in-law and my daughter practically built their synagogue on their own in
Columbia, Maryland. My daughter in Tucson, Arizona is very active with her
husband in her synagogue, and a lot of other organizations. So this — regardless
what I have done, when I see my kids are doing that, I figure I can take it easy. So
in a way, by watching us through the years, they — you know, they picked up our
lead and they doing that — this. And I myself, you know, I work at — as a volunteer
at the museum and I’ve been asked lots of times, how — how can you work here? I
mean, especially what you have gone through, to sit here? And I said, you know
what? This museum was really not built for me, because I carry the museum with

had gone on, and hopefully that they gonna learn something from it. And as far as
I’m concerned, I always say when they ask me how can you work there, I said, how
can I not? To me it’s almost my life. I work for the museum, I give money to the
museum. I mean, it’s very important for me to — the museum should be in existence.
Q: When did you begin working at the museum?
A: I started working for the museum way before the museum was built, when it was
still — the offices they had on Ell(ph) Street, I used to go whenever they had some
people that wanted to learn a little bit more about it and to raise, which in the
beginning was really mostly raising money, because how do you put up this
building? By raising money because they got the land for the — for the to — the land
where to put it on, but to put it on cost a lot of money.
Q: So you were active in raising money”?
A: Absolutely. It’s a — it’s — matter of fact, my little cousin that I told you, she and I
had a, in my home, right here, a — a what they called it, a parlor meeting, where you
invite a lot of friends and relatives and of course, you ask them for money. And we
raised money through this way. My daughter in her place in Columbia, she and her
friends, she made — gave a parlor meeting for the museum and raised money for the

museum. So we worked for the museum way, way before the museum was even in
existence.
Q: And how did you and the museum know about each other before it was in
existence so that you got started —
A: You know, it’s — it’s only work them out. First of all, I’m also active in the
Jewish — the Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Friends of Greater Washington. We
have an organization here and as a matter of fact when the museum was opened, I
was president of that organization. Now I’m an officer, but we have a group that we
keep up this organization, and th-they — if you’re interested and if you know that we
can help you out a little bit, you find us. And th-they found us. They — they — they
knew about us and they got in touch with us and so we spoke on their behalf. And
to this day I still do and that — as you know, my job is with the development
department. I still raise money.

that was at this conference and she called [indecipherable] and wanted to have a
survivor to come and talk to her class. And I went, as a matter of fact with John
Minnick about two weeks ago, per — le-left on a Monday, we came back Tuesday.
So you see, it’s two days. I don’t always particular do it in the museum. However,
when they have the — these things with the teachers, the Balfour and what’s the
other one? It’s — I’m embarrassed I can’t think of the m — maybe it will come to me.
It’s a fellowship, you know, that they get th-the teachers to come to — and they teach
them how to teach the Holocaust 1n other schools. And I speak to them lots of times
as a survivor. They like it. As a matter of fact, if we had time I could show you
some letters that I have gotten from some of these teachers, how they express how
it’s — it’s —1t’s so wonderful that what they have learned, and what the museum,
how it’s wonderful, but however, just listening to a survivor makes it all to them so
real that they put a — a very big emphasis on having a survivor. This one tea-
teachers’ conf — conference did specify that, said that they should use this more
often.

you’re married and you have three children — at that time I had only my three girls, I

It was like a natural thing to do. But now that you ask me, I will tell you why. I said,
what you actual expected me to do is really, I would have given victory to Hitler,
because that’s what he started out to do, and then, after I would have died, we
wouldn’t have left anybody. So what — you wa — I would be helping him out. I
mean, not that I thought about it when I was having children, but now that you ask
me, I’m thinking about it. And he said, you know what? I can see your point. I
never thought about it. It always bothered me. Because he apparently was from
New York and he knew a lot of survivors, and he was always wondering why are
those people having children. He said, 1t always bothered me, why would you bring
in children into this world. But now he said, thank you for explaining it to me,

questions without stop. But I have one group who is really — fifth graders and —
because I usually don’t like to speak to such young kids. Of course, I use it a little
bit different. I always say, I make life beautiful, you know, like this movie, “Life is
Beautiful?” I make it a little bit it shouldn’t be so hard on the young kids. But this
teacher also was taking a course how to s — teach the Holocaust. And I spoke to the
teachers and she called me to come to speak to her kids. And I said how — what
grade are they in? She says fifth graders. I said fifth graders, I’m sorry. I would
rather not speak to them because I think they’re too young. Call me when they get
into high s — you know, junior high school. She said, I will tell you what, Mrs.
Spiegel, I’Il make a deal with you. You come to me one time and if you won’t agree
with that these kids are ready, then next time when I call you, you may hang up on
me. I —I went to her this last March I went to her, that’s already the fifth time.
Because she really does. She has learned a lot about the Holocaust — the teacher,
and she really prepares those kids so beautifully that they ask questions, I want to

kids from one of these trips attends Georgetown University here. And she had
prepared a program for commemoration of the Holocaust for Georgetown
University and she asked me to come be the speaker there, and the kids were just
absolutely wonderful. I mean, they are not such kids, they are already college kids,
they’re probably 19 - 20 years old, but the — I guess they felt so like I was that age
almost when I came out. And this is one that I was just also spoke at the Aberdeen

I actually was almost like liberated, that was it. And this was in — in — oh, this 1s
from — for the United States Army Material Command to — that I was a speaker on
April, 1993. You know, all these things [indecipherable]. Here is one that — oh, on
the Woodbridge campus at the University of Virginia, I was just recently a
speaker. I go there, it’s probably already the fourth of fifth year that I go there. I
happen to know this professor that works there and she calls me every year. So I go.
So as I say, I do a lot of this kind of work where in the evening lots of times, so
that’s the on — that’s the reason I only do it once a week in the museum, because if I
worked long — more time, I wouldn’t have any time to do this and I feel like this is
also very important to do this and — oh, and this is — this we got from Miles
Lehrman, an appreciation certificate for, you know, because for our work. And this
is also that I was president of the [indecipherable] yeah, of the survivors —
Holocaust survivors, when I stepped down as president, because after being so
many years, you can’t keep on being the president counc —
Q: How many years were you the president?
A: Probably — was it like about three or four years? You know, at least three years.
But you see, the reason I don’t remember exactly, because even when I stepped

Interview with Regina Spiegel “
May 11, 1999
A: Yeah, so it didn’t make any difference, it just — except we switched the ranks, so
to speak because I — basically we have a nucleus of certain people that do the work
and we feel like we can’t be — somebody else doesn’t want to step in, so we feel
like, between us, we’ll do it. So we take every time somebody else’s job so it
shouldn’t be constantly in the same job.
Q: Well, you’ve certainly told us a lot. What else would you like to say, or what
have I not asked you?
A: No, you have asked me quite a bit. The only thing what I do want to say, that I
do — I always like to finish with a — that I am really grateful to this country, that no
matter what they did before, they could have done much more, but once it was over
that I’m really grateful to this country that they did let us come into this place,
because I love the United States. I really do. I feel like —I feel like — like I’ve never
been born in Poland, except — this is my country. I feel much more towards the
United States than towards the country that I was born in. And I’m grateful. I have
a very good life here and my husband made a very good living and we raised a
wonderful family and wonderful kids and we’re really very grateful t-to God and to
this country for letting us 1n to — to do the work and we hope to be able to do the
work as long as we — we can go on. That’s the main thing. And we appreciate you
coming and listening to me, too.
