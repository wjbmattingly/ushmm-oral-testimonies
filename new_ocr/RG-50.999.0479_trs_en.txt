>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. I'm the host of the museum's public program First Person.
Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First
Person today is Mr. David Bayer whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We
are grateful for their sponsorship. I'd like to let you know that Mr. Louis Smith is here with us
today.

[Applause]

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our
First Person guests serves as volunteers here with this museum. Our program will continue
twice weekly through mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides
information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can
complete the Stay Connected card in your program that you received today or speak with a
museum representative at the end of our program at the back of the theater. In filling out that
form, you will also receive an electronic copy of David Bayer's biography so that you can
remember and share his testimony after you leave today.

David will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time for questions, we will have

the opportunity for you to ask David a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to
hear from David is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We've prepared a brief slide
presentation to help with his introduction.

We begin with this 1945 portrait of David Bayer taken in his hometown after liberation.
On this map of Europe, the arrow points to Poland where David was born September 27, 1922.
He will be 92 this September.

On this map of Poland the arrow points to the approximate location of Kozienice,
David's hometown.

Here is a contemporary photograph of David's home in Kozienice.

David's brother Joshua is in this 1938 photo of a Zionist youth group. He is in the third
row, third from the left. | can put the cursor on him in case you can't see it there.

In 1939 German troops invaded Poland starting the Second World War. The next
year the Bayers were forced to move into the Kozienice ghetto. Here we see a view of the
Kozienice ghetto through the barbed wire fence that enclosed it.

In September 1942 the ghetto was liquidated and its inhabitants, including members of
David's family, were deported to the Treblinka killing center. The arrow points to Treblinka.
David was taken to Pionki, an industrial complex that produced munitions. In 1944 he was
deported to Auschwitz. Our second arrow points to Auschwitz.

This next photo shows a fence around the barracks in the main camp at Auschwitz.
As the Soviet Army neared, David and the other prisoners were sent on a Death March.

However, David managed to escape into the forest and was found by the Soviets. He spent
two years in the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp in Germany. Here we have a map of
the major camps for Jewish displaced persons with the arrow pointing to the Foehrenwald
displaced persons camp.

This next photo, David and his friends pose at an airport near the displaced persons
camp in 1946.

Here we see David with a friend at the Foehrenwald displaced persons camp.

We close with two photos from Panama. First, David in front of the gate to the
synagogue in Panama city. And here we see David standing by his employer's horse in
Panama City. After a remarkable year in Panama David went to Israel as a Israeli soldier in
the War for Independence. He saw a great deal of combat. Eventually David returned to
Panama before coming to the United States to start a family and a new life.

Today David and his wife Adele live just outside of Washington, D.C. The Bayers
have two children, daughter Sandra and son Mark, and two grandchildren. They now have a
4-month-old great grandson. Their grandson Josh, who served in the Israeli Army, is a civil
engineer in Virginia. Their granddaughter Jennifer, a recent graduate of the University of
Kansas, is now teaching on Maryland's Eastern Shore.

David volunteers his time in the museum's Registry on Wednesdays and often on
other days. The Registry is the office where he researches and compiles lists of those who
survived the Holocaust as well as those who perished. Among other purposes, the Registry
helps make it possible for survivors, family members, and others to find those who may have

survived.

In addition to our First Person program, David speaks frequently about his Holocaust
experience. Two weeks ago he spoke to a group of more than 50 Navy personnel who are
assigned to the White House. He also speaks with groups -- of visitors in the Museum,
especially those who are Hispanic speaking as David is fluent in Spanish.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. David Bayer.

[Applause]
>> David Bayer: Thank you.
>> Bill Benson: Welcome, David. Thank you so much.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to sit because I'm an old man.
>> Bill Benson: I'm joining you in that. Thanks for being here, David. Thanks for being willing
to be our First Person today. You have so much to tell us in a short period so let's start.
>> David Bayer: If | will tell everything | have to tell, you would stay here for two days.
>> Bill Benson: They might be willing to. No. We'll do the very condensed version.

David, it was less than a month before your 17th birthday when the Nazis invaded
Poland September 1, 1939. Before we talk about the war and the Holocaust, tell us a little bit
about your family, your community, and you before the war began.
>> David Bayer: | lived in a little town called Kozienice. In Polish it means nothing happened
to the goat. That's what it is.

[Laughter]

So my father had a shoe factory. We had about 25 people working for us. | went to

school, played soccer. | had a good life. We had a maid. We had a good life, a big house,
my sister, 19 years old, a little brother 12, a little sister 8 years old. And | was 16 1/2. This
was 1939.

When the Germans came in --
>> Bill Benson: Let me ask you a couple more questions. Was there a large Jewish
population in your town?
>> David Bayer: About 5,000 Jewish people living in the town of about 12,000. So it was
almost 50/50 population, half Jewish. The Jewish people in that town were all shoemakers,
tailors, jewelers. The surrounding area was all farms. And every Thursday there was market
day. They get along very well with the population. We lived there for hundreds of years.
>> Bill Benson: And your father, was he a shoemaker?
>> David Bayer: My father was 42, 41.
>> Bill Benson: What was his occupation?
>> David Bayer: When he got married, his parents wanted him to sit, read the Bible, and
study. That's all. He didn't want to do that. So he went in the shoe business. He was working
hard. Then he opened his own factory. We made out good. We had a showroom, a big shop.
We sold shoes all over the country.

Well, the Germans came in September 9, 1939. We escaped to the forests. We
stayed in the forest hiding because of the bombardment. When we came back to our house,
everything was plundered. The Germans were in our house taking my mother's dishes, table
cloths, bedspread, clothing, shoes, thousands of shoes. We were scared to death. They were

laughing and making fun of us. They asked: What are you doing here? It's our house. They
said no more. The Germans took everything. They loaded up whatever they can. They
cleaned everything out.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother -- among the things that they destroyed and took was your
mother's Passover dishes.
>> David Bayer: She had a box, a big box, with all kinds of dishes, maybe 200, 300 years old.
All kind. They broke it. They took whatever they want. She was crying. Mother was crying.
I'll never forget that she was crying. | was very upset and still are.

There was a curfew. We couldn't get out. We had no food. We had nothing. | went
out, went to a bakery to wait for bread. So people were lining up to get bread. There was a
curfew. The Germans came and took me and everybody else from there and locked us up in
the church. The church was close from my house. We looked out our window, we could see
the church. Hundreds of people locked up in that church. My mother was standing in front of
the door, waiting and waiting for me, crying. My younger brother came out from the -- from the
churchyard | waved to him and he saw me. So my mother knew what happened, where | am.
So she felt a little bit better.

Then my grown-up sister, 19 years old, she was a blond, beautiful girl, she went to a
town out of Kozienice, maybe 30-kilometers. | was locked up. From the church they took me
there. She bribed the guard to let me out, free. She took money. She bribed the guard. |
came home.

Then the persecution started. Day after day, every day, the Germans walked in our

house and asked us to put the Star of David on the door because the neighborhood had to
have a Star of David on the front of the door. One day they came in, took my father out.
Maybe six Germans came in and got him. They wanted him to dig ditches or something, |
don't know, behind the church. My mother was worried, crying, crying. | should go and
exchange myself for my father. That's what | did. | went to exchange myself. But he slipped
away and | took his place. This was one day.

The second day they took -- this was Gestapo man. This was not civilian, regular
German, big shots. My uncle, my younger brother was working for a Gestapo man. What he
was doing was washing his clothing, shining his shoes, cleaning his apartment. The German
was nice to him. They gave him food to take home. So my uncle was just married a few
months ago. So he asked the German if he could be exchanged for me. He agreed. So |
went to work instead of my uncle. He didn't go. | went to work for the Gestapo man.

He was good to me, too. He gave me food to take home. | was happy. Everybody had to
work.

The Germans occupied all the Jewish people to work for nothing: sweep the sidewalk,
shovel the snow, whatever, to keep us busy. But this Gestapo man, a big husky guy, he was
in charge of the whole area. He had a Polish young boy, 18 years old, in the dungeon. There
was a door in the floor. It was the basement, a young man. They are accusing him for having
a gun. The boy was sleeping in a barn. And the Germans raided the area and they find a gun
in the barn. And they accused him for having the gun. He cried, he begged. He said, "It's not
my gun."

But | was the translator. | soeak German-to-German and translate from Polish. The
boy, | never knew him because he's not from my hometown. He was from somewhere else.
He keeps saying, "This is not my gun," he cried all the time. So about two, three times we had
interrogation. | was translating. One day, all of a sudden the discussion he was saying, "It's
not my gun. | didn't do nothing. | was sleeping there." This German who was good to me, he
gave me food and | worked with him, pulled a pistol and shot that boy in the basement. | was
scared. | thought they're going to do the same thing to me.

What I'm trying to bring out to you is he shot him for no reason. He didn't believe him.
No jury, no trial, no nothing; just a gun and shot him. And | had to take him out and bury him in
the field. He's probably still there now. This was Gestapo man. Then he left and he wanted
me to go with him. | said no, | can't leave my parents; | have to be home. So! worked with
somebody else. You have to be busy. If you worked, the Germans sent you to Auschwitz,
sent you to camps somewhere else.

Then they told us to move out of our house. They were creating a ghetto. All Jews
would live outside the Jewish neighborhood; have to move into the ghetto. We had a big
house, about four bedrooms, storage rooms, all kinds of hallways. We had to leave
everything. Besides, the Germans took half of it away anyway, machinery, whatever.

SO we moved to one room. One room we got. | had to pull whatever | had ina sled. And
that's it.

My sister was looking like an Aryan girl, blond. So one day she put on a wooden
cross; she got a pair of boots we were hiding. She went to the farm to sell the boots.

>> Bill Benson: She walked out of the ghetto?
>> David Bayer: She sneaked out under the barbed wire, an area that was not so visible. She
never came back. | never saw my sister again. She was 19. She was a beauty. She was
dressed very nicely.

After the war | went to the farmer and he told me that she was there and sold the
boots and got food. She was carrying a canvas bag with all kinds of food. And the Gestapo,
the Nazis, got her, locked her up in a jail. In 1942, September 27, they shipped away all the
people from my hometown to Treblinka and killed them, almost 8,000 people. Because there
were more people from the surrounding towns brought into our ghetto. So there was about
8,000 people.
>> Bill Benson: David, before you go on from there, when they liquidated the ghetto and took
the 8,000 away, before they did that, besides your sister, you also sneaked out of the ghetto.
Right?
>> David Bayer: | sneaked out so many times. I'm still sneaking out.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: And how would you do that?
>> David Bayer: | risked my life so many times because we had to eat. My mother was
always worried. She was praying, always praying. She was praying, her Bible, always
praying, all the time. God will help. God will help. But God didn't help.

The reason | mention God because a lot of questions people ask, in school, high
school kids, your relation with God. A lot of times | don't want to talk about it. | don't want to

talk about God. Because we were religious people. Here we had nobody to help us. That's all
we got is God. And God didn't help.
>> Bill Benson: David, when the ghetto was liquidated and your family was taken, you were
away working on the irrigation canal.
>> David Bayer: | went to work for the irrigation canal. About 400 to 500 people from my town
went to work there, all the young people. The Polish government were building the canal
before the war. And the Germans continued to do it but with slave labor, like me. And every
day, practically every day, | had a chance to sneak away from the canal and go to farmers to
beg for bread, for food. Went to the field, steal potatoes.

One day when | came back to the canal, there was nobody near the canal; only the
shovels and the wheel barrels, everybody was gone. The Germans came and took everybody
away to an ammunition factory, to Skarzysko. | was left alone in the field. | went to a farmer.
And he said to me: There are a few people left in town to clean up the ghetto. If you want to,
I'll be taking you there one day. | stayed with the farmer maybe three, four days. And then he
took me to that ghetto, empty. Nobody there, only the buildings. | sneaked in. And | worked
over there cleaning the ghetto.

And then the Germans took us away to a town, a city called Radom. In Radom, the
previous people were already taken to Treblinka, but there was maybe about 500 people left in
the ghetto; influential people, rich people, you know, the people who had money to buy every
day their life. But Germans planned to kill us anyhow.

So what happened, one day -- tell you a story what happened in Radom. They

announced -- the Germans announced that they wanted to exchange German prisoners,
German prisoners -- the British locked up Germans in Palestine. This was 1942. They wanted
to exchange from Jews for the Germans. So whoever has money could buy his life to be an
exchange for a German prisoner.

There were a lot of doctors and lawyers, some people with money in Radom. They
came out. The Germans came in with a bus, a big truck, a Red Cross. And they go and take
all the Jewish people who want to be exchanged for the Germans. They didn't do it. They
took them to the cemetery and killed them. They took everything away from them, their
money, their treasures, everything. | didn't have any money, so | couldn't be exchanged. So
lucky | survived. They took them to the cemetery. They already dig a grave and they killed
them there; shot them all. And | was there.
>> Bill Benson: David from Radom you were taken to Pionki, right?
>> David Bayer: There was a factory, ammunition factory, in our area between Radom and
Kozienice. The Germans took it over eventually. They wanted slave labor. So they keep
coming to the ghettos to whatever, people they could get to work in the factory. | volunteered
to go to Pionki from Radom. But every time | went to the truck, they didn't want to take me
because | didn't have no luggage. The soldiers who were driving the truck: What do you
have? Nothing? They didn't take me.

So there was a couple in Radom, a friend of mine and his wife. They were friends of
my father. They didn't want to take old people, only wanted to take young. They come over to
me and give me two bundles and also their son. And the Germans took us.

>> Bill Benson: David, the significance of having the luggage or the bundles was that you had
something they could take.
>> David Bayer: The people give me the two bundles. | never Knew what was inside. Didn't
need to. They knew they were going to kill them so they gave it to me. | took the bundle. The
Germans took it away. | didn't know what was inside. Then | worked in the ammunition factory
in Pionki. The Germans taught me to make powder for bullets. For two years | was working
there. | was an expert, practically. | was very good in that. But the gases and the chemicals
are killing us. We didn't have good food. We didn't wear no masks where | worked, that
department. So a lot -- it was very bad. My glands swell up a lot of times.

And then the Russians were advancing and beating the Germans. The Germans
were losing the war.
>> Bill Benson: Before you go there, talk a little bit more before your time at Pionki. Tell us
about in order to get enough to eat, you had to do bartering and smuggling. How did you
manage?
>> David Bayer: We took a chance. We worked with civilians. The Polish people went to the
factory and went home every day.
>> Bill Benson: Just like regular employees.
>> David Bayer: The job before the war, during the war. The Germans paid them. They were
experts. They were working in ammunition factory. They came every day to work. They
brought lunch, sandwiches, brought soup. After a while the Germans gave us clothing from
the people who they killed. So we exchanged with the Polish people the clothing for food.

A lot of times, there was a supervisor working with me. He asked me to clean a room
where the Germans and the Polish supervisors were smoking. Forbidden to smoke, but they
had a special room. So! went in to clean up. And | got the cigarette butts picked up, old
cigarette butts. One would give away his bread for a cigarette. Some people who were
smoking, none of them survived. Smokers never survived because they need the cigarettes
very badly. So they gave away their bread, soup, anything for a cigarette.

| had a supervisor, he went to my hometown, for a man who worked for my father. We
had stocked up a lot of stuff in our house, in his house. He went there to bring me something,
clothing. | tell him to take my father's suit; | didn't need it. So | got food any way | can.
>> Bill Benson: You also took other chances, including trying to escape from Pionki. Will you
share with us a couple of your escape attempts?
>> David Bayer: One day there was a young man in the ammunition factory where | was
working. His name was Mosze Matis, tall, big guy. His job was to take the chemicals from the
tankers to connect to the building. The chemicals were used to make the powder. He said to
me, there's an opening in the barbed wire and we could escape. In the forest there's Polish
underground, fighters against the Germans, and we could join them.

Sure enough me and him sneaked out through the barbed wire and we walked into the
forest. We see big posters, big posters in German and Polish, "10 liters of vodka to bring in a
Jew." When | saw that, | said, “Mosze Matis, we have to go back.” And we went back.
One Pol was waiving us, in the field cutting wheat. But we were scared. 10 liters of vodka or
10 pounds of sugar, 10-kilos of sugar.

>> Bill Benson: So you went back to Pionki?
>> David Bayer: We went back the same route and nothing happened.
>> Bill Benson: Also, am | correct that while you were at Pionki you were severely burned ina
locomotive explosion.
>> David Bayer: Well, | worked in the ammunition factory for almost two years. | begged one
of the supervisors to give me another job. It was very bad for me. | couldn't breathe anymore.
So he gave me a job in a little locomotive to transfer -- process stuff to another department. |
worked with a Polish man together. It was a hot day. He was fooling around with the
locomotive. Some spark came out. The whole locomotive blew up. | got burned; my arms,
my face, and my legs. So | didn't go to work anymore. | stayed in camp a while, until the
Germans were losing the war with Russia. They were retreating. And they wanted to
dismantle the factory, take everything to Germany, the machinery, everything; everything that
they could put on train and shipped it away.

They came in one day -- not one day, every day -- and got volunteers. Whoever
wants to go with them. If they didn't get the volunteers, they took you. There was no war
anymore. There was no food. There was no electricity. Didn't give us no food. So everyone
was hiding under the beds, in the forest, behind the trees.

One day, one German, we saw him coming into the gate, one German who used to
work with me, an engineer, a very good man. What do you mean good? He didn't kick us. He
didn't yell at us. He didn't say good morning, goodbye. He was very nice. Smiling guy. He
was fixing the pumps all the time. He came in, everybody wants to go with him because he

a guy. Shot in the crowd. He was scared. They were running to him. He thought they would
attack him or something because everyone was running on top of each other.
>> Bill Benson: In reality, they just wanted to go with him.
>> David Bayer: Yeah. But one shot, killed a man. | don't know where, | was hiding under the
bed.
>> Bill Benson: As you were being forced out of Pionki, you were able to get some food by
sneaking into tunnels, if | remember right. You snuck into some tunnels.
>> David Bayer: Well, in Pionki, we were free. The Germans were waiting for the train to take
us somewhere away. So we were looking for the big complex, a lot of warehouses. And they
find a lot of rice and big cheeses, big 25-pound cheeses but no water. We had no water. The
pumps didn't work no more because no electricity. Everything was knocked out. They got sick
eating cheese, no water.

Finally, we dig in the ground. We got some water but all dirty water. And | cooked up
rice, made some patties. That's all | had to eat. Then the train came and took us Auschwitz.

| will go back to Pionki. No, to the ghetto. There was a man named Max from my
hometown. He was shipped from Blechhammer. No, Treblinka. And he escaped from
Treblinka. He came to Pionki. Because his sister was working in Pionki. And he came into
Pionki, sneaked in through the barbed wire. He told everybody that the Germans killed
everybody from the transport from Kozienice to Treblinka. Everybody called him crazy.
Impossible. Didn't believe it. We didn't believe the Germans would kill women and children for

And he keeps saying, “Believe me. | was there.” So why did you survive? Because
the Germans picked him up, all the goods taken from the people to ship back to Germany. He
was working for them in Treblinka. He escaped one day and came to Pionki. But when the
transport was going to take us to Auschwitz, he said, "I'm not going on no train." Not going to
no train no more. He run to the barbed wire and started to jump. A guard shot him. He was
hanging there, everybody to see on the barbed wire. His name is Max Blumenschweiz
(Phonetic).
>> Bill Benson: You were forced on the train.
>> David Bayer: They called him crazy, crazy, crazy. Everybody thought he was crazy. He
was not crazy.
>> Bill Benson: As you found out.
>> David Bayer: We didn't believe him. He told the truth. He told that the Germans killed
everybody. We couldn't understand. Why should they kill us, everybody? For what? They
made me work. Isn't that enough? But killing everybody from top to bottom? 6 million
people? My hometown, everybody gone. Not one Jew left in my hometown. My little sister, 8
years old. They were murderers.

Did you notice | don't call them Nazis? | call Germans. They were all Nazis. They
were all Germans. So | call them Germans. They were not such good people. Now they're
good people. Now -- because they have money. They're making chemicals again and selling
it to Syria. You don't want me to talk about that.

>> David Bayer: When | came to Auschwitz, the Germans opened the doors -- the Germans
had helpers. The Jewish people who were temporarily alive opened the door. Some dead fell
out. Some hardly could walk. One man who opened the door, saw me. My face was -- |

>> Bill Benson: From your burns.
>> David Bayer: Yeah. He said, “Tell them you are chemist, you made explosives. They will
keep you alive. Maybe they will use you or something.” So that's what happened. A Nazi
came over, a German officer. He said, “What happened?” | told him. Ok, put me aside.

So then in the meantime, they killed all the gypsies. They killed in one night. They
came in and cleaned the whole camp: women and children, people dancing, singing. And the
young man, they sent a German, worked in coal mine, factories. The rest they killed all the
women and children and old men.
>> Bill Benson: David --
>> David Bayer: And then some German dignitaries came in and got me and a few other guys
to work in the coal mine. So they took us to a place, a concentration camp, a subcamp of
Auschwitz. It was about 15, 20 kilometers away. And | went to work in a coal mine.
>> Bill Benson: And that was extremely dangerous work. Tell us what your quota was.
>> David Bayer: The Germans -- you have to produce 18 wagons of coal. 18 little wagons of
coal.
>> Bill Benson: Per day.
>> David Bayer: Per day. If not, you could not get out. Again and again and again.

The food they gave us was very bad. Hard work. It was impossible. A lot of us learned how
to cheat. So everybody had a tag with a number. Hang up the number and how many coals.
We managed to switch. | got somebody else's coal. Put my number. We didn't make the
number no matter how we tried. We cheated a lot. We knew it.

And then there was one German, a Nazi. He was a Polish -- ethic German. He
speaks Polish and German. He was our supervisor. He was checking the coal, the walls, the

ceilings, where to drill, where not to drill. He was a murderer. He walked around with a stick
and a copper handle, like a pick handle. He didn't like somebody or didn't move fast enough,
he hit them over the head. All their brains came out. Killed hundreds of people there.

Also with us working, a Polish miner, a Polish patriot. He was a nice man. He's the one who
was putting the dynamite --
>> Bill Benson: | want to interrupt for a second. Before you continue, | want to fix your
microphone for a minute. But before you continue, tell us about Ruben. | think Ruben --
>> David Bayer: Oh, ok. We worked, about eight guys to a group. A lot of groups, all over the
mine. If one died, the next day there's somebody else. So they got a young man whose name
was Ruben. He was from Poland, a big town. He was maybe 16, 17. He was a very religious
guy. That's all he did, continually praying. We also called him crazy. That's all he did. All his
mumbling, mumbling in Hebrew from memory. He was a religious fanatic. And he sticks to me
like glue. Everywhere | went, | worked. He tried to help me. He picked up the coal with the
hands. The shovel we got were 10 kilos, very heavy, big one.

So he was always praying. But this Polish miner, one day he told us, "Every time | tell
you to move, silently, | don't want nobody to hear, move." From the area where he works.
One day the Germans come in and he was working, checking the walls. And the Polish miner
gestured to us before we could move away from the area. And the Polish miner pushed the
button and blow up the German to pieces. The whole wall, the whole ceiling fall down on him
and covered him up. Ruben came over to me and said to me, “Did your God help us?” We
didn't call him crazy no more.

[Laughter]

And since then when people ask me about God, | always think of Ruben. Ruben
comes to my mind all the time. Ruben survived the war. That's another story.
>> Bill Benson: We may talk about him later.
>> David Bayer: Ruben lives in Jerusalem. He has 11 children. He is a rabbi teaching
Hebrew. He's still alive. He was 4 years younger than | am. I'm 91. He's still in the 80s.
>> Bill Benson: A youngster.

In January, suddenly you're brought out of the coal mines early and told you have to
leave.
>> David Bayer: A lot of times we went to the mine working. A lot of times we went by train.
The Germans, when we came home from the mine, the camp where we lived, told us to go
take a shower. We have no soap, no towels, no warm water. Wintertime. It was December.
January. Cold. We had to run from the barracks to the shower in the middle of the camp,
icicles all over. A lot of people run and the Germans rush you. They die. They froze to death.

Then the one day we came out of the mine. The Russians were closer or they were
coming; the bombardment. We could hear them. The Russians were very close. The
Germans said evacuation; take what you can and let’s go.

So we have to hook up, arms to each other, and march out; no food, no nothing in the
snow. We marched to Germany. The main highways were clogged up with German trucks,
the tanks. We had to walk on the country road, very bad places. We couldn't walk. Feet were
frozen, hands are cold.

And we had guards, hundreds of German guards, and hundreds of Ukrainian guards,
collaborators with the Germans. You hear a lot about Ukraine. Could happen to better people,
what happened to them over there. They were murderers. They helped the Germans. They
hate the Russians so they hate us, too. So thousands of thousands joined the Germans.
They were guards, shooters, killers, and everything else. And now they're nice people and
they want freedom and everything. They didn't give us freedom at all. Very bad. Treated us
very bad.
>> Bill Benson: And this march that you were on, it's called a Death March.
>> David Bayer: You don't want me to talk about that neither.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: | just want to make sure we get through what you want to tell us about you
during the war.
>> David Bayer: I’m the one who don't forgive. Some people in this world forgive, tolerance,
this and that. | am not tolerant and | am not forgiving. That's what I'm going to die. So if |
have to tell like it is, | tell it. They were murders. They were killers. That's the way it is.
>> Bill Benson: | want to make sure that you are able to finish telling us what you want to in
our time. Finish about the Death March that you were on, if you don't mind.
>> David Bayer: We have plenty of time.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Ok, David.

because Ruben was always next to me. And he was so scary. He was a real scary Jew,
everything, scared. The Germans one day told us -- everybody to lie down. Thousands of
thousands of people, maybe 3,000, 4,000 people lie down in the snow. That's all you see,
skies, dark spot in the snow, humans. We were lying there. No German, no Ukrainian,
nothing. They all went in the houses to warm up, in the farms.

| noticed a lot of dogs come and going, come and going, barking. So there's dogs.

There has to be something, food, maybe. Sure enough Ruben starts scream and crying,
“Don't go. They're going to kill you.” | said, “The Germans are not here.” | crawled over.
There was a dead horse and a lot of dogs coming in grabbing meat. And | did the same thing.
Grabbed a piece. Broke off easy because it was frozen. Bone and meat. Ruben was kosher.
You know what kosher is? He ate all right.
[Laughter]
And | ate. We all ate. Chewed a piece of meat. And it helped a lot. It helped a lot.
>> Bill Benson: And at one point, if | understand correctly, you were forced into a barn and
then they tried to set the barn on fire.
>> David Bayer: Well, we slept a lot of places. Let me tell you something. They wanted to
rest so they tell us to rest, too. We didn't warm up, didn't eat. Just lie down in the snow. One
day there was a big barn. They pushed whoever they could get in there in the barn. Everyone
was crying, crowding them up. We had no space anymore. The Germans also pushed in the
Kapos. The Kapos who helped the Germans, they all had to get in the barn. And there was
one German -- | have to tell about that guy.

There was one German. He was a criminal, a murderer. He killed people for nothing.
He was a Kapo. | don't know if you know what a Kapo means. A Kapo, it means a supervisor
in Italian. Kapo, the ram, the Kapo. He walked around like a big shot. He walked around with
a club. But he was in jail for killing his mother. He killed -- he was a murderer, a criminal. He
killed his mother. He went to jail. The Germans took him out of jail and put him in the
concentration camp.
>> Bill Benson: And made him a supervisor.
>> David Bayer: And made him a Kapo. All right? He killed a lot of people.

What happened -- he was marching with us, too. He was supposed to be a prisoner
but a collaborator. He was in the barn. He never came out alive. The prisoners killed.
| don't know how the fire started. But | thought later on that somebody tried to kill him with the
fire, burn him or something.
>> Bill Benson: So a fire got started.
>> David Bayer: And we all walked out and that's it. The body burned. That's it. And then we
keep walking. | went to a place in Germany, a concentration camp where all the prisoners
were already taken out. There were some left, British, Russian prisoners, military men, all
military men. It was a big camp. And the Germans told us to get in. Then they give you bread
when you walk out to the gate. They didn't give nothing to anybody. Whoever went to the gate
didn't get anything. They pushed them out. Keep on walking.

There were a lot of warehouses there. So what happened, there was no electricity in
the barbed wire anymore, no electricity in the camp because the Russians knocked out all the

And there were Germans shooting, shooting all the time. They broke into the warehouse. |

my pants, wherever | can. | couldn't even walk out anymore. And | got a piece of iron like from
a kitchen stove, you know. | was thinking when | go out, all the people were robbing me

people got killed running to the warehouses. | was lucky. | don't know how | managed, but |
did.

| came into the warehouse -- | mean to my barrack. My friends who were working with

me, or on the march, couldn't walk anymore. Nobody wants to go. Ruben wants to go.
Ruben, me, and two Russian prisoners went out to the barbed wire and people line up behind
me. Everybody pushing, pushing, wants to get out. If | wanted to go back, | couldn't because
everybody was pushing. Fall down in a ravine. Then we walked through the forest.
Ruben couldn't walk anymore because he got a bullet or something. He was bleeding. He's
like, "| cannot walk anymore." So we put him in a farm barn. Me and the two Russian
prisoners went through the forest. We stayed there for almost six days.
>> David Bayer: What did you eat while you were in the forest?

>> David Bayer: | forgot something which | remind myself right here. | wanted to tell you. Go
back to the coal mine. Every morning when we went to work we have roll call. Everybody had

nothing. Lie me down, tie me up. One was holding my head. The doctor was smiling. A
German doctor. His name [Inaudible]. What | have here, our museum, go to Germany, look
for documentation. And who did they find? My name with the doctor who operated on me, the
whole report, even my tattoo, on the paper here.

The smiling doctor who smiled. | see his face every day. He was hiding for 20 years
in East Germany, that doctor, from 1945 to 1965. He was in hiding. Somebody snitched on
him. They had a trial. And they hanged him in 1965. But nobody could deny. There's the
proof, the documentation, right there.

Why -- they found a lot of documentation. But when | went to that clinic, it was a warm
clinic. There was food, clean. And there was a nurse, a Polish young man from my
hometown. He said to me nobody goes from here out alive. | said, “You sewed me up and I'm
all right.” He said, “They're going to send you to Auschwitz to kill you.” So | said to him, “Get

>> Bill Benson: That's how you got back to the coal mines?
>> David Bayer: If | would have stayed longer in the clinic, after the operation, after
recuperating, they send me to Auschwitz and gas me because they didn't want no witnesses.
But | am a witness. | am here. | am alive. This is one in a million.

>> Bill Benson: David, in our remaining time, you're in the woods hiding with the two Russian
prisoners of war. When were you liberated? When did know you were liberated?
>> David Bayer: We were staying in the forest for a long time. We had no food anymore. We
had nothing. We were digging under the snow to look for mushroom roots. We ate some bark
in the pine trees. We couldn't stay anymore. We were dying. | couldn't walk anymore. So we
walked out. And the Russians were there. We walked out. The Russians were standing with

the Army or who knows, maybe killed. But the daughter was a young woman. But she was
sloppy, dirty. The reason she was sloppy and dirty, didn't want the Russians to rape them or
something.

food. But she didn't have much food. If she had a lot, | would have been dead. | would have

>> David Bayer: | didn't find nothing there. My house was a 5 and 10 store. The Pol who got
it, he was begging me. He said, “You going to take it back?” | said no. | don't want to stay in
Poland.
>> Bill Benson: Besides the house, he had furniture and family belongings that belonged to
your family.

So | took off. | went back to Germany, to the American side where the Americans give us milk
and honey, everything, cigarettes, everything. The Russians didn't have nothing to give. From
there | went to Panama, South America.
>> Bill Benson: Why did you go to Panama?
>> David Bayer: | had nowhere else to go. The American Consul from Munich called me and
said somebody in Panama is looking for you. Well, a friend of mine who | went to school with
before the war, his parents, went away to Panama for immigration. They immigrated there.
He saw me on alist of survivors so asked if | wanted to go to Panama. | said why not. What's
the difference where | go? So! went to Panama. It was all right.
>> Bill Benson: You told me at one time that your first year in Panama was the best year of
your life.
>> David Bayer: You know why? Because | lived with the Indians in the jungle. It was not
civilization, no hustle, bustle, no nothing; lived primitive. Good people. | worked -- | was
making leather for the Indians, making sandals, moccasins. They were selling it to the stores.
They were good people, humble, nice people. Didn't have much. | didn't have nothing. They
called me Polish Jew. If | was a German, they would still call me a Polish Jew because they
didn't know nothing but a Polish Jew.

There was a man -- one day | went to the capital of the Province. The capital of the

Everything. They were very nice people. And then he told me that the German Jews: Why
