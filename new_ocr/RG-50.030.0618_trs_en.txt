A: I think they must have gotten married in California, but I never pursued the
thing, because I was never asked.
Q: And how many siblings? Were you the oldest child?

which was many equipments due to — for bathrooms. And it was — from what I
understood, he was working, then pursuing to make a career for engineering.
Q: Okay. And as a Mexican-American growing up in California, what was it like
for you at the time? How were you treated by other people?
A: Being born in San Bernardino, California — my mother died when I was a year
and a half old, and my — so that left us, my sister and me. And I recall when I was
next to her, at the time of her death, I still — my sister was crawling all over the
place, and she didn’t know what was happening. So, my father decided, after her
death, to move to Pasadena, and where he had met, 40 — four years later, met my

other mother, my stepmother, and her name was Maria Louisa, and — and she was
born in Durango, Mexico, in this little town of Topia. And so, when I lived in
Pasadena, I grew up with what you call half-cousins. I — to me, they turned out to
be more cousins than my own cousins, cause I didn’t know my cousins very well.
Q: And what was it like growing up? How were you — where did you go to school?
A: I went to school in the east side of Pasadena. It — they call it the - Lamanda
Park. And the little area was what you call a barrio Viejo, a little town, or a
village, with no sidewalks and no pavement at all. And a school call — elementary
school called Freeman(ph) school, and where Mexicans — Mexican-Americans
could not associate with Americans, at that time. So we — we were all Mexican-
Americans, born in the United States, and the — not to associate with the
Americans.
Q: Do you know why not?
A: Beg pardon?
Q: Do you know why not? What did they — were the reasons why, or —
A: We never knew. It was just a question mark that we had in our minds, that why
we were not allowed to play with, or associate with them. And the most funny thing
is that my teacher — and I remember her, Mrs. — Mrs. Greenhof(ph), her husband
was the conductor, Mr. Greenhof(ph), and he turned out to be my — my godfather

in first communion, were a very nice person, even though they were teachers at that
school.
Q: So you had separate classes than the other students? The American students, you
had separate classes from them?
A: No, Americans were in — were to associate in tha — in that school at all.
Q: And how did that affect you, as a child?
A: Well, we — it was just the question, we — we didn’t know why, until we found
out that even if we went to Brookside Park, up towards the Rose Bowl, and — and
we went swimming, that we were to swim in the — in that area where only Mexican-
Americans swam. And I knew that the blacks couldn’t swim in our area, wer —
because we weren’t to associate with them. And only the whites were to — to swim
in their area.
Q: And how did — how did that make you feel, as a child?
A: Well, it — it just felt like not wanted. But, at that moment, we let it pass. We
didn’t say nothing.
Q: And what was the — the general treatment otherwise, like of your parents?
A: My father remained like a person incognito, because he went about his own
business, never thought about — of us, or saying well, don’t worry, or nothing. Just
kept along. So, as I started to grow up, little by little, there my — with my half-

cousins — there was Ernetto(ph) Priatto(ph), which was — he was the son of the —
of the aunt of my mother — my stepmother. So that was a family together. And so
we had selling papers in the corners, delivering papers to houses. And we walk from
[indecipherable] it was called, a little barrio. We head down Correro(ph) Street,
to Hill Street, then get ready for the N-New Year’s day, and sell papers for
everybody to — and so they use the paper, newspapers for pillows, or cover up while
the Rose parade was able to start.
Q: And did you go to church, growing up?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: Did you go to church?
A: Our church was in — right there at the barrio, which the name was Saint
Joseph’s church. And with time, I found out it disappeared. But that was when I left
for Mexico.
Q: So, why did you go back to Mexico?
A: At the time, well, it was all strange, that my mother started to — or my
stepmother, that I call her mother, I noticed that she started to have somebody pack
her furniture, and all our furniture, and — and then the truck came by and picked up
all that furniture, and then as — well, we asked her, we says, what’s happened, where
are you going? She said no, we are all going. And I says, where are we going? She

says, we re going to Mexico. And I says why? He says, because we were told to
leave the United States. And si — but, does my father know about it? He knows
about it. My father was in Mexico, and — and he had a good job, he had graduated
from engineering, and became a — an architectural engineer, and — and all things
that we didn’t even know, while we were growing. Every door — everything was
incognito. And so, at that time, was — by that time, I was about around nine and a
half years old, close to 10, and — and where are we heading, I asked my mother. She
said, we’re heading toward Durango, Durango, Mexico. And so, when we arrived
in Durango, I remember that my father had a house rented out for us to live, just a
few days before they get a house. And so I remember sleeping on top of the — one
of those big suitcases, that you used to travel in a big ships, at one time. And was
funny how we had to just sleep on top of that, and fall down. And kid’s stuff, that
we [indecipherable]. So that — then I started to grow up then, and my father begin
to increase his title, his engineering, his business. He became well-known. And it
was altogether a different custom of life, living in Mexico, compared to in the
United States.
Q: How so?
A: Oh, they call me the gringo, because I was born in United States, and that I
know half English and half Spanish. And that was kind of difficult, but before I

knew it, I had a teacher tell me, he says, I want you to help me to teach these ch-
children to speak English. And she was an English teacher, so I tag along.
Q: And what was — so you were going to school, and your father was now working
— where was your father working now?
A: My father became a director of public works for the state of Durango. And —
and so, at that time as I — as I started to grow up, he — it was time when the
Olympics was supposed to start. Mexico was the named nation to — for the
Olympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic
swimming pool, which was a hundred meters long, by 50 meters wide, with all the
decorations, as a— a— an Olympic swimming pool would look like, and with a—a
transmitter along the side of that swimming pool so that people could listen to the
music, and — and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited
about the Olympics, but then there was two other fellows and myself, we al — they
all — always called us the — the three musketeers. And I liked to make — do exercise,
and so I — I trained re — by looking at the books my father had of Charles Atlas,
well-known then. And every morning we used to — well, these fellows would come
over and pick me up, and we’d go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the
morning. And then about seven, we’d head back to s — to school. This time it was
about — the war had started, the 40s, 1940. And Corolla(ph), Antonio Corolla(ph)

was my friend. He was a — a — the son of a — a diplomat, congressman. Jose Blanco
— Pepe Blanco(ph) they call him, Pepe, he was the nephew of a railroad conductor.
Which he knew the Morse code very well. So we went out swimming, and Pepe
Blanco(ph) says, Atlas, Atlas, there’s a spy going on. I said, why, what do you
know? We are very low voice, because we hear music in the distance, and I was
from the transmitter. He says that there’s a Morse code going on, and — and — and
there — there are submarines in Baja, California connected with — with these
people. I says, but how? How do you know? Yeah, I hear, dara de dara dara de
dara dara dara — so they said that we better get to your father. So we decided — we
dashed out that swimming pool, we headed back to school. And they went to
school, and I went to his office, my father’s office, and I knocked quick at the door
of his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he — before you knew it,
he had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the
Germany. Well, I didn’t realize then that we had a — a German colony in — in
Mexico. And here I was associated well with the groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We
had formed a Boy Scout group, and our scoutmaster, Boy Scout master was the
Schraeder(ph), a Schraeder(ph) family that owned a hardwood store there in
Durango. And so, by that time I was 17 and a half years old, and an amer — the

to go back in United States and serve your country. Yes, sir. He was very good
friend of — he was a very nice friend of ours. And so I said goodbye to my parents,
and my mother pre — my mother prepared me, meaning that she — she took my coat
pocket, 200 dollars, put it — a safety pin on it. She says, this is nobody steal it from
you. Use it when you can. Yeah, but how am I gonna take it out of there, it’s — it’s —
it’s secured. All these funny things get — one asks. But anyway, I had it — I said
goodbye to my parents and — and I took the train from Durango to the city of
Torreon, we transferred over — I transferred over to another train. And at that time I
didn’t know the traveling situation, because I had never traveled. And — and I- I
had my little satchel with me, and little suitcase. And I heard somebody say, psst,
psst, psst, just a — like a whistling at me through the window of the other coach
train. And I went up, and he says, give it to me, he say, I have a seat here for you.
So we met fre — made friends, and we became friends until a year later. But PII tell
the story about that. I — I said goodbye to him, because he was supposed to meet his
sister there, in Juarez. I crossed the border, and I headed to Pasadena, back to my
cousin’s. And that’s where I headed for induction, the following day. And then the
— the head of the induction center said that I needed another semester of school.
And I said, why? He says, well, we don’t evaluate the sc — the — what you went
through in your school, is not enough. I says, I went to school seven in the morning

til six in the evening. Isn’t that enough? And, I says, they teach us very much over
there. More than they teach you here. I couldn’t say any more, he says, but you need
— you need a one semester. So I went to Pasadena City College, I took a course,
and I passed by three months in that vacation. And I wa — I got my diploma, and —
and I’m in the army. So before I knew it, I was in Oregon, in Camp Adair,
Oregon. We call it Swamp Adair, because it was full of swamps. And then I was
transferred, and I had special letters that my father had given me, as a duc —
introduction, showing that my efforts was to — wanted to be a doctor. And so, before
I knew it, I was transferred from the infantry to the — to go to medical school.
Q: Did you know what was going on in Europe with the situation with the Jews, or
what was happening at all during the war? Were you aware of any of that?
A: Until then, little by little, I started to pick up about Germany, and the spies were
going on, and — and — and the frustrations of what was happening, and yet, they kept
us so that we’d be alert. So they send me to the medical school, I went for four —
four and a half months, and gave a study for equivalent almost for a year of study.
And I graduated, and I headed back to my outfit, and before you know it, I — we’re
all heading back — heading for Europe. That’s when I was going to sa — well, I’m

division.

said, Murray, don’t speak like that. You should pray, have faith. No, no, no, I have
a feeling I’m gonna die. I said, Murray, don’t say that. But anyway, I changed his
mind by talking other things. Then that — two days later we headed for — for Lyon,
France. And we were delighted, he was assigned to a group, and I was assigned to
another group of Company B, and he was assigned to Company A something. But
anyway, we went to battle, and on my assignment I headed with Company B, on a
special assignment, and I just followed. I carried my duffel bag, and all my
equipment with me, and everybody used to laugh at me, and yell at me, and say,
Anthony, drop that. Drop all that stuff [indecipherable] they gonna kill you,
you’re a sore thumb, you — I said, no, I says, that’s gonna save my life. And so, we
had it to their assignment, what they had to do, and I just followed, and as we were
heading back, they finished what they had to do, the battalion. And — and we were
marching towards a ridge, and there was a dike down below, and I heard an echo,
medic, medic, cause there were machine guns going on back and forth. And I was
carrying my stuff with me, and then — and then it’s — so finally I picked up the
sound, and I started to head downhill. And as I was heading down the hill, I tripped
on some branches. And when I tripped over those branches, then I saw up ahead, a
cave with Germans. Well, there were about six Germans in there, with machine
guns. And those machine guns were the umpteen, I mean, just you thought there

were thousands of them, but it turned out to be that the — those machine guns that
brrt, brrt, brrt. And at that time when they start shooting at me, my stuff went up
in the air. My duffel bag and everything, it just turn up into a [indecipherable]. My
other boots were in ping pong here and there, and so on, so forth. I fell on the
ground and I crawled to my helmet, and before I knew it I was with the fellows that
they were wounded, so I — by that time they had control of the — the Germans, and
the — and so I was doing repair jobs. First aid sutures and sewing thumbs. Cutting a
leg off, and putting a tourniquet, and sewing up that leg, the stump. Doing this and
that, so — as a medic. So finally, we all started to head back and they helped me with
the wounded. And as we were heading back, our scout said that we couldn’t get to —
back to Philippsbourg, and so we decided — he said, move over to the hill. And so
we went up to the hill, and there I saw Murray Pruzan, that he had been killed. He
tried to save the — well, he did save the — our captain — commander’s life. He had
severe wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was — was cut in half by
machine guns. I lost my friend. And, at that time, it was just like saying, all hell
broke loose, there on that hill. And we were there from the — oh, for days before
Christmas until the sixth — the second of — the second of January —
Q: And this is —

A: Falkenberg Hill.
Q: Okay.
A: And that’s when the Germans came up the hill and — and we had to surrender,
and we tried to destroy everything what we could carry. I carried my — my first aid,
everything, equipment with me, as much as I could, to help the f— the sick. When
the Germans took us, they forced us to get my shoes off — our boots off, walk down
the slope barefooted in the snow, and march for about almost a mile, to the trucks.

Maginot Line, and the [indecipherable] Line.
Q: Okay.
A: And at that time, when we — we took the train, an experience was that all the
fellows felt, oh, you know what, we need some wine. I said, oh no, the expression
that you get sometimes that, now they want to drink, to lose their fears. No, thank
you. But, smell this. And it’s — and a — and they call it schnapps. And I says, well,
that smells like turpentine, that you wash your hands from, after you finish painting.
That’s — then they tell, that’s better than vodka. I says, I don’t drink that. I

wanted to feel a little numbness from the fear. And we got to Philippsbourg, and it
turned out to be a wire factory.
Q: I’m sorry, what country was Philippsbourg in?
A: It’s a little town of France and Germany, that it has a highway, and they — they
used to call it the 80 — the corner 80. I don’t know why they used that term, but
anyway, it was Philippsbourg. And from Philippsbourg to Falkenberg was just a
few kilometers to where the — that hill was.
Q: And that was in Belgium’?

A: In the battle.
Q: What was going on around you?
A: We — we were going to head back to — I mean, we were going to head up the

Q: Do you remember his name?
A: No, I don’t reme — no, I don’t remember his name.
Q: Okay.
A: At that time there were fellas that — where you had to — or they commit suicide.

A: American. American. Oh, there would be fella that they were — they were afraid
and — and they started lose that — that feeling of — want to do something, and yet
they cannot do anything at all, because they couldn’t think any more, and they said,
could you baptize me? Or he says, I don’t know how to pray, I’m afraid. And so I
would more or less remind him a prayer, or whatever. I says, the — I’d ask them
what religion. No religion. They had no faith, and they weren’t taught to have faith,
and so this — these were fellas that y-you — you come across.
Q: What faith were you?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: What religion were you?
A: Catholic.
Q: Catholic. Did you have a prayer book with you, or how did you help them pray?
A: I pra—I had my prayer book with me, and — and I would use some phrases that
wouldn’t be too long, but enough to — for that person, that soldier, to motivate him,
make him feel motivated, and feel free of fear. That’s what he was, he was afraid.
Q: So you weren’t just a medic, you were their chaplain.
A: I had to use the — th-the — the chaplain — we had the rights to do that, for purpose
of trying to save lives.

A: It made me feel that — more opened, more relaxed, more faith, more strong. And
that’s what gave me — invigorated me not to be afraid.
Q: So how did you feel going into battle, and what did you see around you?
A: To me, I had question marks in up here, and I said, God help me, and there I go
with the rest of them. And — and I’m in your hands.
Q: And what was it like that — those first few days going into battle, what did you
see?
A: Afraid that any moment wi — a German was going to sh-shoot in where or what
direction. Cause when I — at that time, when I had turned over that — that fellow, a —
a sergeant asked the captain, what are we going to do with these Germans? They
had captured about 30 - 40 of them, and they had them all by the wire factory, to the
side of the wire factory, and so the sergeant went over and said, captain, what do we
do with them? Take care of them.
Q: This is taking care of the Germans.
A: Take care of the Germans. Well, you can use the terminology in two ways. Take
care of them by — by guard them, don’t do anything to them, because they’re
prisoners, or shoot them. Well, that was the incorrect. He shot them, all of them.
Q: The American.

A: And — and that gave me a feeling of, why did they have to shoot them, since they
were already in our hands, with no equipment. And they were not endangering our
lives. A prisoner of war is a prisoner of war.
Q: Did you see the shooting take place?
A: But I submit — I submitted that report. That was wrong, what they did there.
Q: Did anything — were there any repercussion for that American?
A: I never knew. I never knew. But wa — that was one of the cases where I — it kept
me — in my mind. So — and so that was, at the time, before heading out into — with
my duffel bag and everything. And so, when I was up in that hill, and I took care of
the fellas —
Q: How did —
A: — first aid.
Q: Yeah, I was, how did you take care of the fellas, cause you were now up on
Falkenberg Hill.

A: That was before getting to Falkenberg.
Q: Okay.
A: We were heading back, and the assignment that the group had been assigned to
do away with — annihilate certain pillboxes that there were Germans.
Q: What are pillboxes?
A: That’s where Germans had equipment, the secret equipment, the missiles, or — or
[indecipherable] bombs that they were shooting. And so, us medics didn’t know
what was then — what they were doing, what were the assignments, it was secret.
And us medic, you just take care of the sick and the wounded. So that was when,
upon heading back, they had finished the assignment, and that was — it was heading
back, and when I heard that the — the sound effects of the medic, medic, and — and
you can — you — you find the echo from all sides, and a [indecipherable] the echoes

totally different from — I — I mean, you’d never experienced anything like this. How
are you feeling at that time?
A: To me, I —I — when I left Mexico, I — I wasn’t too happy living in Mexico,
because I was used to my being in — in good old Pasadena. That’s where I wanted
to be all the time, because if I turn back a little bit over there, living in Pasadena,
my cousin and I would have a little scraper, and we buy ice, big cubes of ice, and
scrape it. And that fill up in a cup, and soak it with Kool-Aid flavors and sell it for
three cents a cup, going down the road, house by house. And that’s how we — and
every penny, or whatever penny we made, we’d give it to my mother, or — part of
our lives. So, things like that motivated you, the — doing things that you’re not
supposed to do.

Murray, | told you not to fear, that you were going to survive. That’s all I had to — I
couldn’t do anything else but to pray for him, because his soul had been taken. And

couldn’t go because the Germans had taken Falkenberg — I mean, had taken
Philippsbourg, the wire factory. And that — that to head for Falkenberg. And so
we headed up there, that we had to entrench ourselves, and get — dig in and make
our own foxhole, and — until whatever happened, because the — our planes were
protecting the area, permitting the Germans to go up the hill. But it turned too late,
because we ran out of ammunition, and the — the — then the Germans had more
control of the area, and we couldn’t do it any more there, our buddies couldn’t do it
any more, because they ran out of ammo — ammunition.

And whatever happened, to eliminate that situation. In other words, Germans hated
the Jewish, totally. And they — my buddy, I remember Norm Feldman(ph), he says

A: The pool, yeah.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: And then the other undesirables, bad records, whoever had — had bad records,
they selected them. And they knew very well what kind of background they had.
Q: How many Americans were selected?
A: Three hundred and fifty.
Q: Okay.
A: Three or 350.
Q: And what did they tell you, after the selection?
A: Nothing. They wouldn’t even talk to you about nothing, absolutely nothing. For
a while they didn’t say nothing, until you were to be completely segregated from
the whole groups. You were nothing but a — a little sel-selection here on one side,
and to leave the place, and says — and the term was that we were to travel to a place
that we were supposed to have oh, the unique place to play ball. We’d have motion
pictures, and oh, beautify our thoughts, by giving us good thinking.

Q: So they just told you — they tell you you were being transferred to a different
POW camp’?
A: No, nothing like that. All just to say — tell us that we were being taken to —
excuse me — to a place — selected with better care. And it was hell.
Q: So, did they take you out of Stalag [X-B that — that day?
A: The following day.
Q: So what did — how did you — what did they do to you, the next day?
A: Put us on a train.
Q: What kind? Like a —
A: A boxcar, where you couldn’t kneel, you couldn’t squat, for six days, in the — in
those boxcars. And fellas couldn’t defecate at all, they had to do it right there, right
— and for six days, you — and you couldn’t eat nothing, you couldn’t have nothing to
eat, nothing to drink. But the — the snow that hit the — from the cracks, you tried to
lick it, or p-poke your hand through the slot window, to get the drops of water, from
the rain. Until we came to Berga an der Elster, which is part of the — the
compounds of Buchenwald.
Q: What did you see when you arrived at Berga”?
A: It was so snowy that you couldn’t catch the glimpse very well, but you see like a

the train, and to head to the area, that turned out to be barracks that were ugly, ugly,
like falling apart. So, in other words, the barracks were that the cracks — when you
were inside, you could see the — the wind, feel the wind coming in through the
cracks.
Q: And how many men per barrack? Was it — were you all together in one?
A: One barracks is — we were divided into groups, to fit 60 to 80 ina—ina—ina
barracks, with a — three bunks. Three slots —
Q: How many people per bunk?
A: Three. Three to a bunk.
Q: Like three per level?
A: Per level, three levels.
Q: Okay. Were there other prisoners there when you arrived?
A: They had them separated from us. They were the Jewish prisoners that had —
they had them separated from us.
Q: What was your first impression when you saw those prisoners? Did you know
who they were?
A: We didn’t know. We didn’t know — we didn’t know until afterwards, we found
out that the — they were being worked in the mi — in the tunnels. So, when they
selected our groups into si— 16 per group per tunnel, there were 11 to 12 tunnels. In

October 13, 2010
each tunnel, they had fellas go in and dig into the tunnels, to enlarge the areas inside
of the tunnels, to — well, we didn’t know why the tunnels were being built.
Q: Did you have to work in the tunnels, or were you given a different job?
A: Us medics were to only take of the — the sick. And then, what I did was, I asked
the commander, why not? If a fellas gotta work in that tunnel today, gi-give him a
day off tomorrow, and have another group work for him, so kind of liberate him
from it.
Q: So what was their work schedule?
A: They slapped my face. They slapped me, they hit me, because I was supposed to
say nothing. But that was not [indecipherable] I’m a medic. You’re supposed to — I
said, don’t we have a doctor? They told us they had a doctor, but that wasn’t true.
So we didn’t have a doctor. So what we were doing is trying to take care of the
fellows. Norm Feldman(ph), as well as others like that, worked in the tunnels, and
they breathed the silt, that — that came out of the — the rock. And that damaged the
po — the lungs. Some of the fellows, like Norm, would — would tell me what they
did was try to weaken the — the — the dynamite, so that the — they wouldn’t be too
powerful [indecipherable]. But I laugh when he tell me about the things. Totally
laughed.
Q: Like what — what other things? They tried to do sabotage.

A: Sabotage to make them — and then they would sabotage the — the cars that — that
carried the rock, to dump it out to the side of the la — the river. And — and this — or
damage in the — the springs, of the — of the cart, when you pull, would fall apart,
without the germ — Germans knowing that it was being done that way.
Q: And what were you doing while they were working in the tunnels? Did you work
in the tunnels?
A: No.
Q: What was your job?
A: No, I— Id go into the tunnels, very on and off, when they let me, to see that the
— what they were doing, and th-that — th-that they were okay, and I’d tell them, I’d
say he’s not well, or please let him out, let him rest. He’s not — he’s weak, and
you’re not feeding him, he’s not eating. He has diarrhea, the dysentery, diarrhea,
everything he had, the fellas.
Q: So you were still being their medic.
A: Ye — beg your pardon?
Q: You were still being their medic.
A: Their medic, yes.
Q: And what was your — so, did you — did you have another job specifically at the
camp, th — a role?

A: No, nothing, nothing. Nothing a — but just a — keeping up with a — the — with the
sick.
Q: Okay.
A: And seeing that they were taken care of. Sometimes some of the fellas started to
feel that they wanted to escape, and — and when they tried escape, they wanted to do
something without the German knowing about it, but it — it didn’t faze us too well,
because the Germans were too smart in that respect.
Q: Did anyone manage to escape?
A: There was two, three of them that escape. Cohen. Cohen was — did escape, but
then he was killed. But there’s another — Latell(ph) escaped, and he managed to
escape. And Cohen, when the German asked me, or told me to verify, to sh—as a
medic, that he was shot because he tried to escape. In other words, you shoot a
person from a distance, okay, you gonna hit him in the back. So, the German asked
me, I want you to check and to see that he 1s being — he was shot trying to escape. I
says, can I turn him over? Can I look at him? And they’re saying okay. And the
Germans was shooting in the forehead, with a wooden bullet. What did they do?
They stand him on a wall — behind the wall, and shoot him in the head, then they
waxed the hole. What does a bullet — wooden bullet do? It’s just that it shoots in,
and splinters inside the — the head. Okay, they were using that as an excuse. They

thought that I wouldn’t identify the wax that covered the hole. So the Germans were
slaughtering our men that tried to escape.
Q: And the conditions were obviously much worse in Berga?
A: Well, they started t-to — force us to take our clothes off, and just sleep with their
underwear, and they would force me to take all the clothes into a shack, just a little
bit outside the barracks, to prevent anyone from escaping. So this got worse,
because the sleeping without the clothes, it was dangerous for your health. Getting
worse pneumonia, and all the qua — the effects, the side effects that you would get,
without being able to eat at all.
Q: Right. Did they — I mean, what kind of food were you provided with? Were you
able to — were the men able to get anything, any nourishment, or any wa — or did
they receive any packages, or — I mean, some camps, people were able to receive
mail, or Red Cross packages.
A: In one occasion we received a package, a Red Cross package, and it was divided
into four to a package, or six to a package. The package was meant to be for one.
One per pack — one per person. And that’s how I got my d-diary, from one of those
packages.
Q: So you received the diary —

Q: — 1n Berga.
A: — in Berga, empty book, yes. And not at Bad Orb. And I used that for that
purpose. But, I mean, the Germans had stacks of Red Cross packages, stacked up in
a — in a warehouse.
Q: So, what was an average day at Berga for all of you? Was there anything as an
average day? Was there any typical day?
A: No.
Q: No.
A: No. And it — stuff — tea to drink was nothing but just grass, boiled it into tea. And
the same thing would be if we got a soup with a few spuds into it, and to flavor it,
we got — we receive harsh water, no taste at all, and with cockroaches, and rats
mixed into it. And it would make you sick from the stomach.
Q: Was there any interaction with the other prisoners? The other political prisoners,
in the other part of the camp’?
A: We didn’t know anything about them, but just that they stayed a — a distance
from us.
Q: Did they work together in the mines, in the tunnels?
A: No, no, they had — didn’t mix with us.
Q: Okay.

A: But from underground, we found out why the Germans had us — had these men
working in those tunnels. We found out later that — that those tunnels were being
made because the Germans were developing secret equipment, missiles, buzz
bombs, and other equipment that they had in mind, that they were hiding in those
tunnels.
Q: And the physical conditions were atrocious. What were the Germans who ran the
camp like? How did they treat you guys?
A: They treated us very bad, because the fact that they beat them. They beat them
with the butt of their rifle, and poke them — would force, say, to geta—ati-a
railroad tie, and carry it into the tunnels, to repair the railroad ties. And they could
barely ha — carry the weight th-they had for themselves, because the fact that — the
weakness that they felt. Not eating, you’re not going to be able to lift anything so
heavy.
Q: And did you receive any news of the war? Did you — was — did you guys know
what was going on outside of Berga?
A: Well — well, we’d — we’d — underground, there was comments. Their one guard,
he was an Austrian, and every time he’d see the bombers fly by and he w — he
would make the sign of the cross and he said — and he — he looked on the side, to

the Germans don’t look at him, what he was doing. But thanking that the — our
bombers would be heading for — it would be about 500 B-17s per hour.
Q: Wow.
A: They would bomb the sites. And you could feel when it bombed the areas, they —
the windows would — the — the glass would crack, the vibration of the bombing. But
things like that. Another thing what we found out, we were — got a hundred grams
of bread per week. Now a hundred bread — grams of bread is not much for every —
but it was a mix of barley with sawdust, ground glass, and ground sand. And the
barley to camouflage — and they make that black bread black because they — the
Germans loved the black bread. And it — that caused damage in your stomach.
Q: Did it give you — how did you feel when you would see the Americans flying
overhead?
A: The day came when the germ — when the Germans started to feel the — the heat.
And the German started to feel the heat when they found out that the English were
coming from one side, the Russians from the other side, the French from the other,
and the Americans. Then they decided to — to put us on a march.
Q: Do you remember what date that was?
A: Happened about around April — April — [break]

Q: A few more — a few more questions about Berga, to go back. With the terrible
conditions in the camp, when did men start being affected by that, aside from men
who were killed when they were escaping. How many men had died, or — or what
happened to them? What was the —
A: Men — th-the fellows were starting to — to get the effects of the — of the — or the
eating, and — and the work, exhaustion, because of the — I mean, th-they — they
couldn’t move their muscles, they had their — they were exhausted. And that was
practically from the beginning of — at the time when we got into Berga to — to live —
one thing that just went by me is when we got to Berga, well, they took us to the —
the cremation center of the — of the Buchenwald, to gi — bathe us. Well, we didn’t
know that there — that was a bathing, we thought they were — they were going to
cremate us.
Q: Like the gas chambers, the showers.
A: They took us to the gas chambers, and we — and we —
Q: Why did you think that?
A: We didn’t know. They took us there, and we saw that — that the tubings, the
pipes up ahead, one was for gas, the other one was for water, with a spray, and
when they told us to take the clothes off, they said that they were going to fumigate
us, take all the lice. Well, fine. But they showed us, and we saw what the Germans

had done, is the — they had — where they were cremating the — the people. Children
and mothers and fathers and all that.
Q: Okay.
A: But, well, this affected a lot of fellas emotionally, because they started to break
down. Stress, and the weakness due to hunger. And that was just before — that was
just right after — oh, about a — about a week after we got there.
Q: To Berga?
A: To Berga.
Q: Okay.
A: The — the time that we were to leave the area, there were six fellas that were in
very critical condition. And they were to be sent to a ho — a British hospital.
Q: To leave which area? I’m sorry. When you were forced to leave Berga, or when
you left Bad Orb?
A: Berga.
Q: Okay.
A: I have the names of the — the — they slip my mind, but —
Q: It’s okay.
A: — one of them, right now is dying. He’s still alive, but he’s dying. He’s in no
condition now even to talk. Martin Wendt(ph). And the other one, he died,

because the Germans didn’t let me do what I was going to do. I had a fountain pen
with me that I was writing all the time with it. As a matter of fact — well, Pll tell you
afterwards.
Q: You can tell me now.
A: That fountain pen lasted quite a bit. I don’t know how, God gave me that ink to
last. And the fellow that I wanted to — he had diphtheria, he couldn’t breathe, he
was choking. And I asked the guard if I could talk to the commander. I said — I said
to the commander, this fella is not going to live. If you don’t let me do this, you’re
going to kill him. And I says, he has diphtheria. All I have to do is make a
tracheotomy operation, and put that thing in so he get — make it to the hospital. And
here’s a fella, he was an older fella. Is a funny name, it — I have it written in — in the
diary. And — and the Germans got mad at me and hit me with the — with the butt of
the rifle, hit me in the face. And the fella didn’t make it. He couldn’t breathe any
more. When [indecipherable] gave me — it gave me as a gift, another Sheaffer. I
hadn’t seen a Sheaffer for a long time.
Q: Now, did — were the American — the Jewish soldiers that were with you, did they
get treated any differently once you arrived at Berga, or were all the men treated the
same? Were they singled out again, for being Jewish?
A: Come again?

being treated —
Q: How were they being treated?
A: But Norm Feldman(ph), Cohen, Bernard Vogel(ph), he was a young fella,
very docile, and he — he gave up very easy, and they forced him to work in the
tunnels. He couldn’t make it. And I asked the — the guard, the — the commander to
trade jobs that — so that they can rest. And they would poke me with a rifle, and they
said, nein, nein, nein. They wouldn’t let me do stu — but I’m a medic. You’d force
me to — to do these things, yet, you don’t follow it up. But they didn’t care. They
did it with hate.
Q: Now, you mentioned your diary, and that you were always writing in it. What
were some — what information were you recording in your diary? [technical]

Beginning File Three

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Anthony Acevedo. So, we left off, you were talking about your
diary, and I was asking you what information did you record in your diary, in
Berga?
A: I tried to keep my, as close as possible, as the information related to the
condition of my fellow men, because the fact that, more or less, I knew that maybe
someday, it would be a valuable thing for — for us, to know that — that there was
important — I was concerned at the condition, knowing that maybe I was at risk
carrying that diary, because a couple of times, it dropped out of my pants. I carried
it right — right inside of my b-belt. And on one occasion, one of the guards picked it
up. It happened to be one of the good guards, it was the Austrian fella that — he said,
what are you writing? I said, just my memoirs of the ca — the beautiful country. Just
faked it, to let him know that I wasn’t writing anything wrong. And so, he believed
me. But I tried to keep it as much as — secured as possible, as I went along,
especially when you would be on the march, and you’d — it would drop on you, then
you would lose it.
Q: Did the other — your fellow American soldiers that you were with, did they know
you were keeping the diary?

A: No, na— only a couple of them. But no one — no one knew.
Q: When did you find time to write in it?
A: I'd find time for just a— where I’d sit, or whether I’d be in the barracks, when
we were then, or where — when we were on the march, I tried to more or less fake it.
Like, I’m going to sleep, I’m falling asleep, and well, everybody would doze off,
and no one knew what I was doing.
Q: Why did you keep a secret from your fellow soldiers?
A: Just to prevent — in case I would run in danger of one of them saying something
to me.
Q: To you, or to the Germans?
A: To the Germans.
Q: Mm-hm. And what were the events leading up to the march from the camp?
A: That march was when the Germans decided that — that their being encountered
with all the allies, almost coming together, and — and so the commander, Merz and
Metz, threatened us to the march towards the Bavarian mountains, where Hitler
lived. And on the march we — I saw — if the other fellows see — seen also, if they
noticed, but I saw that the — the Germans were carrying umpteen — in trucks —
umpteen frames of paintings, that they had with them, towards the mountains. And
the treasures that they were stealing from there.

the camp?

Q: Do you remember the date, approximately, when this was?

Q: So, when — so, you were all gathered together, and told to leave, and what did
the Germans tell you to do? Do you know where — what direction you walked in?
A: No, just go — get out and start marching, walking down the highway. And as we
passed Hof, a li— a town of Hof, Germany, we noticed some of our fellows were
getting s — more sicker and sicker, and they were dying off. And so then we were
experiencing an attack by our jet fighters, against the Germans. They’re firing at ta
— at tanks, German tanks. And so we had to dodge the — the fire, and — or towards
the edge of the highway. Otherwise, we would have been slaughtered by the
machine guns.
Q: Did you see other prisoners, as you were marching, from other camps?

A: There was a section where we experienced the most awesome thing that we ever
saw. And, since we noticed that the Germans were — had behind us miniature tanks,
operated by remote control, and if we intended to escape, or do something, they
would throw those tanks at us. But they were behind us, guarding us. They were
operated by some German, I don’t know how they do — were doing it, but wi — they
had an advanced operation. But up ahead, we noticed that the Germans were
slaughtering political prisoners, we called them political prisoners, but it turned out
to be they were Jewish fellas, and families, children, mothers, and older fellas. And
they were hanging them to the barbed wires, as we went along. Hanging on the
barbed wires because they tried prob — escape, go over the fence.
Q: Where was this, on the road, on the way to Hof?
A: On the road to — on the f — 0-on the road to wherever the [indecipherable]. And
then the — further — still further up ahead, then we had to pull out of the highway,
and I don’t know why they made us — to make a shortcut, or whatever, but we saw a
pile of — same thing, of women and children, families, they were all slaughtered,
murdered. And they weren’t just days, that happened — happened instantly, ahead of
us, they were doing it.

A: Was wa —
Q: What physical condition were you in?
A: Oh, we were just almost at the tail end of where we just — our men were
dropping — dropping off the highway, out of — out of the lines of the march. Our cart
that we pulled and pushed, was full of our sick men, and we could barely pull,
because of our strength, there was no strength at all at th — with all of us being
without food and water.
Q: What did you — sorry.
A: And — and up ahead, we kept on going, and some were dropping out of the lines,
and — and so, we’d stop by a barn, and rest for a minute, or whatever they would let
us rest. The snow started to melt, which was ster — April, part of April, when the
snow 1s getting less and less, but it’s still cold.
Q: What did you do at night? Did you march all night?
A: Kept on marching. Kept on marching sometimes, kept on marching, until the
Germans told us to pull over and — and take a break.
Q: And di — were you given any food at — when you were able to stop?
A: No, not until one — at Hof — we got into Hof, and they — they gave us boiled
eggs, and spuds, but that was just then. After that, we kept on marching again, and

Q: You said a lot of men died during the death march. What did — what happened to
them? What did you do with them if they —
A: We couldn’t do anything because the Germans wouldn’t let us do anything at all.
Bury them, or whatever, they wouldn’t let us do nothing, unless we were — we were
stationed in one spot, either they — they would let us [indecipherable] or pull them
over, and leave them right there, in the spot. Otherwise, they wouldn’t let us do

some of the bread, the bread was black bread, the good bread. And — and then
suddenly, very early in the morning, the German commander — well, we all heard
the firing in the distance, thundering. So, we heard that there were tanks
approaching, and we don’t — we didn’t know whether they were Americans, or
French, or English, whatever. Or Russians. But the Germans started to feel the — the
heat, and so they wanted us to follow them. And so they push — they pulled the — the
rifles against us, and pointed at us, and says, w-we — either we go, or — with them,
or they’ ll shoot us. That’s what they wanted to do. So, as I yelled back at them, and
the other medic, I mean, we’re medics, and we’re t-taking care of these men, and
they’re dying. One just died — or two just died just a — a while ago. So, how can we
go, and — they can’t walk any more. So, before you knew it, they too escaped, and
th-the guards turn in our — gave us our rifles. And he says, we’ll stay with you. And
we started to hear the rumbling getting closer, and th — we — we all started to run
towards the highway, and when we got to the highway, the tanks were the 11"
armored division, liberating us.
Q: Going back just a little bit; when you were on the death march, did you know —
have any sense of what was going on with the war around you, as far as how close
the allies were getting, or any news that you were receiving, now that you weren’t
in the camp?

Q: When the 11" armored division found you.
A: The 11" armored division saw that — when they saw that we were Americans,
and we spoke English very well, then — then they welcomed us, and one of them
pulled me like a — like a beet, string beet. Pulled me up on top of the tank, and then
I ju — just sighed with relief that we are in their hands. And as we were running
towards the — the tanks, some fellas started to fall down dead, because of the
excitement, and because of the weakness.

Q: Why did they keep you secluded?
A: Just to keep us close, to prevent any — I mean, some fellows could try to escape,
because of fear, because of reactions to the medications, or whatever, because the —
some effective medications fire back on them. And then, right then, when we left
the hospital, and then — and then some had to leave by plane to United States,
because of the conditions, like — like Norm Feldman(ph) had to leave by plane,
because of his — he — he wou — would have had his leg amputated because of the

saved my life. Saved my leg, because that turned gangrene. And — but we were — in

everything that you went through, and then you have your father turn his back on
you, and call you a coward, and how did — how did you feel about everything? You
had gone through this experience in the POW camp, and then you were in Berga.
And it was your father who encouraged you to go back to the United States and to
serve in the army. So how — how are you feeling at this point, about everything that
you’ve gone through?
A: I—I-—I put a blank in front of me. I decided then, not to let that bother me.
Because I had other conflicts that was disturbing me, and that was the emotions and
the stress, what I went through when I was a POW. And then, what hit me worse
afterwards, I kept that, the stigma that he said to me, that I was a coward. I kept that
behind me, and I — and I couldn’t get it out of —
Q: And how did you deal with that for the rest of —
A: Yeah. It st — it still bothers me, because you never see a father tell that to his son,
unless he feels like he isn’t proud of anything.
Q: And how did your friends, your old friends who you knew back in school, and in
California, did you see them again after you returned, and how did they treat you?
A: Yeah, I— I—I received my friends and — and then they treated me very well. The
— and their conditions were very — they — mucho — mutually, totally complete,
different. Not like when I told my father, I says, what do you call this, being a

would tell me about Pancho Villa, and — and — and the big, tall heroes. I says, you
know what, that powder that they burn in Mexico is no comparison to the powder of
a woman’s powder that she puts on her face. Because our powder in our gu —

army, we’re going back to your time in the United States. Why did your family
return to Mexico from California?
A: They were forced out of the United States, because they were — they were
Mexican citizens, and not American citizens. And they had no — I understood that
they had no perm — documents to permit them to leave the United States.

A: Well, supposedly my father was to be my father. I — he — when my mother —
originally, my mother died when I was about ano — a year and a half old. He
remarried when I was four years old. And th-then I grew up with my mother’s other
family, and — and got to where I felt like I had another family.
Q: And did you — so, did you get along with your father at that point?
A: I didn’t seem to get to know my father very well, because in the first place — I
don’t think that he was very much a father. I hate to say it, but I feel that, with an
expression of — of feeling, because I remember when I was still in — 1n dur — in
Durango, Mexico, that one day he said, come along with me, and I want to show

A: I was — I was getting to be where I was 15 years old. And — and so he — what he
did was to — he took me to a place where he get — getting his car serviced. And
while he was getting his car serviced, we stood out there on the sidewalk, and he
pointed me to a canteen, a bar. He says, you know who | — who works out of there?
I says, no. He says, well, how come? Well, why do you ask me? And he says, well,
a lot of young fellows like to get into bars. I said, what makes you think that I
would la — rather get into a bar? And he didn’t like the answer, or the question. And
then, so he changed his mind, and trying to finagle me into something else. And
then he took out some pictures, and he says, see? And he showed me three children.
He says, well, he says, I want to do away with you and your sister. What makes you
think that — that [indecipherable] do away — you want to kill us? Why not? And
that let me to feel more cold. And, with time — he didn’t repeat that again to me, but
I kept away from him, and that gave me more thoughts of almost trying to leave the
country.

I don’t know why — why they made me that way, but they had me make. So that
day, I finished the parade, come home. I just got in at home, and then my mother
says, Antonio, when you have time, when you undressed, you changed clothes,
don’t forget to throw the trash. I says, oh yes, I will change the clothes. Before you
know it, my father had overheard, and he got the box, a box of — tomato box, empty,
and he cracked it on my back. Just like, boom. He says, get out of here. I don’t want
to see you again.
Q: And how old were you at this —
A: About 15 years old.

didn’t want to live there any more. And then, before you knew it, I was waiting for
my friend after school, I was waiting for him about three or four blocks from there.
And with him was the director, and my father was with him. And they were coming
over to — and my father, to apologize to me. By that time I had that — I didn’t have
that feeling that I had a stigma against him. So that made me feel that I didn’t want
to be no more in — in Mexico. That’s why. No more. And that taught me to be more

Q: And so then you came — you came back to the States, you joined the army. And

registered in our survivors’ registry, here at the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. The Holocaust — as a survivor of Nazi persecution. Do you see yourself
this way, as a survivor, as a Holocaust survivor, when you think of this?
A: It’s an honor. It’s a pleasure to be in — part of it, because I feel that what they
went through, my respect to all those people, children and mothers and fathers.
Q: When — when people started to talk about what they had gone through in the
Holocaust, did — did that encourage you to begin to speak publicly?
A: Your emotions get to where you want to say a lot, but you can’t cover a lot of
territory. You wish you’d cover a lot of territory, and yet, it — 1t — it ties a knot in
your throat.
Q: And what — as — as a Latino, what would you like Latinos to understand about
this experience, about your experience?
A: Some are hard to understand, but some stress out and — and to the surprise, they
remain blah. They — they di — don’t understand why it happened, why this, why

supposed to do.

should they learn about the Holocaust, Latinos, as much as it’s part of Jewish
history?
A: Yes, they should.
Q: Why?
A: They must learn t-to be able to love more, to understand, and be able to get along
with each other, and respect each other, and respect others.
Q: Do they ever — has it ever been your experience where they think it won’t
happen to them, because they’re not Jewish, or —

names are starting to dissipate. And in there is one of my buddies, that was Dr.
William Shapiro, which he died this Christmas, past Christmas, of cancer.
Otherwise, he would have been with us, in this group.
Q: So, by giving us these very personal belongings, and this being the nation’s
memorial, to tell this history, what do you hope others, particularly younger
audiences, what do you hope that they will understand when they learn about your
diary, and when they learn about what you’ve given the museum? What do you
want them to understand, through the — this donation?
A: One important thing is this able to — to get into their hearts, and their minds, that
feeling of — that they would think that it sounded impossible, but the impossible
came true to life, and able to understand, and penetrate into their minds, what reality
did exist. Because some of them do not understand yet. And this they ha —
something has to get — be implemented into their lives, so it would penetrate.
Otherwise, 1t would be a blah, not understanding what it is exactly.

you’ve been through?
A: That penetrates, cause it’s the truth. It’s — it’s more than a prayer. And hope to
under — everyone will be able to understand the meaning of tt.
Q: And with that — with those words, and — and your comrades, when you — when
you have talked to other survivors throughout the years, do you feel that bond with
the other Berga survivors? And how do you describe that bond, if you feel it?
A: I fe — these words, so hard words, that mean a lot. It is a feeling of — it means a
lot, really. It’s penetrating. I hope that people would understand that.
Q: You — you and others who were imprisoned at ber — in Berga, you were denied
full disability. You mentioned that only for six months, you received 150 dollars,
and then it stopped. And the US Army would not publicly acknowledge what
happened to you. Can you put into words what that meant to you, what that means
to you now? What that meant to you then, and now?

A: — of using it that way. If not, there’s another word for it, and that there must not
have been no feelings at all, to think that the United States gave all those people,
all those soldiers to be out there, and gave their lives, for other lives just to survive,
families. There must not be no feeling. Why they have that audacity, that yet it
doesn’t penetrate into their minds, the feelings of what other people have, a life.
And yet, some go to church and pray, and they turn around and slap you in the face.
And yet, the — no respect. And here, one the — instead of giving the 150, here,
because you served your country. It’s a laugh. Like, lot of people said, we don’t
expect the money. We res — we expect dignity, and — and the true fact of — the
feeling of — of love. Not double talk. [break]
Q2: Tony, you just spoke so eloquently just now, of what it felt like when your
country turned its back on you, and told you that you couldn’t talk about what you’d
been through, and denied you the benefits. And yet, you fly your flag, the American
flag, and the POW flag every day from your home. Can you talk a little bit about
that sort of feeling of — of — there must be something in there that — that says, on
some level, there’s a love for this country, even so. Otherwise, I don’t know that
you'd be flying that flag. Can you talk a little bit about that?
A: It’s very hard to express myself for that respect, but I fly the flag of the POWs,
because the thought of what’s remaining, and what’s gone. The gone is, God took

them. The American flag is due to respect, and the dignity of the United States,
remains a love. But yet, you would think that there’s still something way back over
there, that they’re trying to almost implement a law that there’s no such thing as in
God we trust, or nothing like that. Which I think it’s nothing but a bunch of double
talk that they’re trying to do, to implement. We’re trying to f— it 1s the fact, give
our countries more strength. If the people would open up and be more dignified, to
maintain the firmness, then we’d show we respect that flag as the strength of the
country. And in God we trust. We love. And He protect us, which they don’t
believe in that, but they’re a bunch of atheists.
Q2: Today you’re giving, as Christina said, a set of your most precious documents,
that talked about what you went through, to the Holocaust Museum. What made
you decide to make this donation to this institution?
A: What make me decide to — to do that?
Q: Yes.
A: I —it’s a wonderful thing to — to find out that finally there is a place where —
there’s a resting place, dignified, the respect of what all these young people, old
people, disappeared, without necessity, with no reason at all. It was horrible, and I
think they deserve at least something, a piece of my life.

A: I —it’s hard to explain. You could say it in many words, but you — there could be
one word. With all dignity, I do respect the lives of what was missing. At least to
remember those of the past and present, which were remaining, of that life that
existed. And we pray for them, too. But the courses — the life of theirs, that remains.
