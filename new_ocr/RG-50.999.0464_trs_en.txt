>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program First
Person. Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program.
Our First Person today is Mrs. Esther Starobin, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation. We are grateful to them for their generosity.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our
First Person guests serve as volunteers here at this museum. Our program will continue
through mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about
each of our upcoming First Person guests. Anyone interested in keeping touch with the
Museum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card in your program or speak
with a museum representative at the back of the theater when the program ends today. In
doing so you will receive an electronic copy of Esther Starobin's biography so that you can
remember and share her testimony after you leave today.

Esther will share with us her First Person account of her experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of our program,
we will have an opportunity for you to ask Esther a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about
to hear from Esther is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief

slide presentation to help with her introduction.

We begin with this photograph of a very young Esther Starobin, born Esther
Rosenfeld. Esther was born in Germany to where the arrow on this map of Europe points.

She was born in Adelsheim, a town north of Stuttgart, to where the arrow points.
Esther was the youngest of five children. In this photograph we see her brother, Herman, her
mother, Katie Rosenfeld, Esther, on her mother's lap, her older sisters, Bertle and Edith, her
father, Adolph Rosenfeld, and her sister, Ruth.

On November 9 and 10, 1938, a violent anti-Jewish Pogrom, known as Kristallnacht
or Night of the Broken Glass instigated by Nazi party officials and Nazi Storm Troopers took
place. The Pogrom took place throughout parts of Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. In
the photograph Germans passed by the shop window of a Jewish-owned business that was
destroyed during Kristallnacht.

Concerned about the safety of their family, the Rosenfelds registered their children
for a Kindertransport, the informal name of a rescue effort that brought thousands of refugee
Jewish children to Great Britain from Nazi Germany between 1938 and 1940. Esther wore this
tag attached to her clothing as she traveled from her hometown of Adelsheim, Germany, to
Thorpe to join her foster family, the Harrisons.

We close our slide presentation with this picture of Esther with her English Foster
family: Alan, Dorothy, and Harry Harrison.

In 1947, Esther came to the United States, settling in Washington, D.C. She
attended the University of Illinois and had a teaching career specializing in world studies in

Montgomery County, Maryland. Esther's husband Fred passed away in April, 2011.

Esther and Fred have two daughters. Judy is an attorney, and daughter Debra
founded the Handmade Afghans Project to, quote, bring comfort and warmth to our wounded
service members. Initially most of the afghans went to Walter Reed Army Hospital but then
also were sent to other military installations including Fort Sam Houston in Texas, Fort Bragg,
in North Carolina, and Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Their goal of making 10,000 afghans
was met in 2013, and, in fact, they exceeded that with 10,845 afghans and this amazing
project came to a close. About 1,600 people nationwide were ultimately involved in making
afghans for this effort. Esther was deeply involved with this project.

Esther and Fred have two grandchildren. John is in his sophomore year of college.
And Drew is a high school junior. Our audience today includes Esther's daughter, Debra, as
well as nieces Renee and Tamar, and Tamar's sons Nathaniel and Solomon. | think we have
them all here in the front row down here.

Thanks for joining us, everybody.

Esther's volunteer work at the museum has involved helping to expand the
Museum's collections of documents, photographs, and other items. Esther also is a contributor
to the writing projects which produces "Echoes of Memory," a collection of writings by survivors
associated with this museum. Following today's program, Esther will be available to sign
copies of "Echoes of Memory."

And with that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming with our First Person
Mrs. Esther Starobin.

[Applause]

Esther, thank you so much for joining us today and for your willingness to be our
First Person. We're glad to have you with us.
>> Esther Starobin: I'm glad to be here.
>> Bill Benson: You have so much to share with us. We just have a short time, so we'll just
jump right into it and get started.

You were very young when your parents sent you to England. And although you
were too young to be able to tell us firsthand about all that you went through and what life was
like in Germany for your family, perhaps we could begin to the extent that you can, give us a
sense of your family, your parents, your extended family, what the hometown was like and
what their community was like in the years before the war and certainly before you were sent
away.
>> Esther Starobin: Well, | have to tell you, everything | know | know because | have been told
by my siblings or because I've looked it up. | really don't remember.

But, first of all, Adelsheim is this really small place. It still only has one traffic light.
And | was there this summer with one of my nieces. We tried to find souvenirs. They didn't
have them, so that gives you an idea how small this place is.

My parents -- there were five of us, as you know from the picture. My father sold
grain to farmers and occasionally would negotiate a trade of a cow or horse or something like
that. He had lost one leg in the First World War, so my mother helped him; especially if the
weather was bad because he had trouble manipulating the cart and getting on that.

There was a small Jewish community there. There was a synagogue; about 10, 12
families. It was really a small community. We had one uncle who lived there, but my uncle
came to this country in 1937, right before | was born. So | didn't know him then.

My sister said they had a very happy childhood until the Nazis came. They went to
school. They visited family. They had family in the next little town. They went there, too.
In fact, | went back in 1960 with my sister -- 80, with my sister. She met people she had gone
to school with. They would talk about somebody had died when they were in first grade, so
here they were talking away about what had the kid died of. | don't speak German. | took
German in high school, in college. It didn't stick too well. I'm not very good at languages. And
| really don't know German. My sister translated when we first went, and then she stopped.
>> Bill Benson: How large was your extended family?
>> Esther Starobin: Well, my parents each had nine siblings. So it was pretty large. Several
of my father's siblings had come to the United States. Two had come very early in the century.
Then my other two uncles had come in the 30s. My mother had one sister who had gone to
England, about 1934 | think. The rest of them were killed in the Holocaust.
>> Bill Benson: And clearly many, many cousins and uncles and aunts.

What was the age range of your siblings?
>> Esther Starobin: I'm the youngest. My oldest sister is 12 years older than | am. The other
three were in the middle. Working it out. Solomon's mother was the middle of the middle.
Renee's father was next to me in age. And then | had one other sister who was close to my
oldest sister in age. So there was a big spread in our ages.

>> Bill Benson: Kristallnacht, November 9, 10, 1938, convinced many German Jews, including
your parents, that life under the Nazis had become intolerable and could get worse. Do you
know anything from what you've learned about the impact of Kristallnacht on your family?
>> Esther Starobin: | do. According to what | found out, there was a man who lives in
Adelsheim; he's done a lot of research on the Jewish families and what happened during the
Holocaust. Whenever | don't Know anything; in other words, when Bill asks me a question, |
send an e-mail and find out the answer.

He said what happened, people came -- they came from other towns. They traveled
through Germany. And each town a few people would join them. And in Adelsheim, they did
break the Jewish shop windows. They dragged books out of the synagogue. But my parents’
house was off the main beaten path so nothing happened to them on Kristallnacht.

My sisters were in Aachen by then. They couldn't go to school. Jewish kids were
not allowed in the public schools. So my three older sisters had been sent to Manheim to live
with an aunt. | guess that school closed. So they were in Aachen. Unlike today there wasn't
instant news, so they had started to walk to school the next day and saw the synagogue
burning. Somebody said, you know, go home. Go back. So they never saw my parents
again. They were living in Aachen at the time.
>> Bill Benson: | imagine at least Bertle remembers that.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. She does remember it.

When | was growing up -- we came to this country when | was 10. At first we didn't
talk about our experiences at all. Then in the 80s, when this started -- when there started to be

a lot of information on television and the stories about the Holocaust, my sister Bertle said,
"Oh, | have some letters that my mother had written when she was in camps." So my husband
worked for a law firm where somebody knew German. They translated them. So basically
what | know about my mother, a little bit about my father because he basically wrote two lines
on each letter, is what I've learned from these letters, wnat my mother was like.

My parents had been living in Adelsheim after | went to England in 1939. My mother
had written these letters from Gurs, camp in France, because they were deported in October of
1940, my parents and my brother Herman. We don't know why they didn't send Herman on
the Kindertransport. They didn't. So they were in France.

The first couple of letters my mother was very optimistic that she was going to get
out. But she wrote like all mothers, you know, make sure you listen to the people you're living
with, thank them, wash behind your ears, study well in school; all the things that any mother
would write. But then the letters changed. She would say to my sister Bertle, "Save your
clothes. I've lost so much weight. | can use the clothes." Or talking about how hard it was.
The tone of the letters changed.

| mean, there are only five letters so I'm reading a lot into these letters. But at the
beginning it was a very optimistic: We're going to be able to come and join you in England and
we'll all be together. And then it was more to my sister who was in the very old -- she was a
teenager: make sure you keep everybody together, stay together. You Know, you stay a
family. Talking about life being hard.

She certainly talked a little bit about what it was like. She talked about Herman,

Renee's father, but not bitter in the way that | think | would be bitter if | was there. Then again,
the letters might have been --
>> Bill Benson: Censored?
>> Esther Starobin: | would think.
>> Bill Benson: We may come back to that, and | hope we will. At Kristallnacht in 1939, your
parents made the extraordinary decision to send their daughters away to England as part of
the Kindertransport. Tell us what the Kindertransport was and then to the extent that you know
anything about the arrangements that were made for you or your sisters to go by
Kindertransport.
>> Esther Starobin: In England the Quakers, basically, went to Parliament and tried to get
Parliament to agree to accept children from Germany to save them. There were some
stipulations. We weren't supposed to stay in England. You had to pay so much in Germany. |
think it was 50 -- whatever was the equivalent of $50 | think. | don't really know that. And
there, of course, were hundreds of people trying to get their kids out.
lt passed Parliament. The Quakers found hostiles for people to live in England. My
Aunt Hannah was in England. She worked as a domestic because it was the only thing she
could do as an immigrant. So my three sisters went from Aachen and she found places for
them from people that she knew from her work. They each went to three different places.
>> Bill Benson: A couple of questions before we get to that. Ultimately, do you know how
many kids were saved by the Kindertransport?
>> Esther Starobin: 10,000.

>> Bill Benson: It was capped at that. Wasn't it?
>> Esther Starobin: Right. The war broke out. 10,000.
>> Bill Benson: And only really from Germany and Austria.
>> Esther Starobin: And Czechoslovakia.
>> Bill Benson: And Czechoslovakia. And your three sisters went separately from you and
ahead of you a little bit. Was that because -- something to do with that they were in Aachen?
>> Esther Starobin: Right. We weren't in the same place. They really never talked about their
actual trip. My sister, Edy, who loved to eat, remembers when they crossed the border into
Holland getting chocolate and orange. My other sisters never talked about it, so | don't know
what they remembered about it. And | was 2 years old. Clearly somebody looked after me.
>> Bill Benson: Some kind of chaperon or somebody was with you.
>> Esther Starobin: | have no idea. As much as I've tried to find that out, | haven't found that
out. But | went from Germany to London. And then | was met by a woman, Mrs. Edmunds.
And she took me from London to where my Foster family lived outside Norridge. | had a copy
from my -- a copy of a letter, could they pick me up. We lived out in the country then. | did
meet her one of the times that | was in England. But the Quakers were very involved in this
because, as now, they were against war.
>> Bill Benson: They would make the arrangements to find different places. So you were
beginning to tell us you had Aunt Hannah living in England, working as a domestic. So she
was sort of instrumental in you getting posted.
>> Esther Starobin: | think so. My sister, Bertle, lived with a family in London. And then they

moved to Scotland. And she went to school in Scotland for a little bit. And after the war she
found out that the man she was living with was actually a spy for the Germans. When they
were in Scotland, he had been plane spotting or doing whatever but apparently not for the
English but for the Germans.
>> Bill Benson: So an amazing cover as a spy, he's taken in a refugee Jewish child in his
home and he's spying for the Germans.
>> Esther Starobin: When she was 16, she left and had to go to work. She lived with my aunt.
And my aunt was rather temperamental. If Bertle got mad, my aunt would take her ration book
so she couldn't leave. She lived in London.

My sister, Edy, lived originally with a family in London. And then as the war
progressed, people were sent out of London. And she lived with a family out in the country.
She felt they treated her like a slave. She didn't go to school after she was 14. She worked
very hard. And then ultimately she joined the British Army. She was in the Army.

My sister, Ruth, Solomon's grandmother, lived with a doctor in London. And then
she was sent to a hostile. And | think someplace else she lived with another family. And she
also was not going to school anymore. But then when we came here in 47, she went to high
school and ultimately to college.
>> Bill Benson: When you use the word hostile, what was that? We think of hostiles for
people that are traveling on the cheap in this country, go -- they can keep their suitcase and
stay in a San Francisco -- wherever it is. What was that like?
>> Esther Starobin: | think it was a way of taking care of children on the cheap, too. Often

they were summer camps that were used for this. So they weren't really warm in the winter.
But they lived there. They went to school and did whatever. Ruth, to me, never talked about it
much. Her children said that she talked about it.
>> Bill Benson: Before we return to your experience in England, let's go back to what you
were telling us about with your mother and your father. Do you know at all why Herman stayed
with them and why Herman didn't come with you? Have you learned anything?
>> [Inaudible]
>> Bill Benson: For those who couldn't hear, the family thought is possibly because he was
the only son and with four sisters the parents didn't want to let the son go, possibly, until later.
There's also some thought that there was difficulty getting him as a boy, to get to a transport,
to actually get out of Germany.

The many, many, many times you've thought about that decision that your parents
made, | imagine for everybody in this room trying to imagine that moment when you say we
have to send them away, must have been extraordinary.
>> Esther Starobin: | can't imagine. There is a movie about the Kindertransport. And in that
movie there's someone who talks about how angry she's always been at her parents for
sending her away. And her parents were killed in the war. | think, to me, it showed such love.
| can't be angry about it. | think it showed love.

And certainly when my kids were that age, | couldn't imagine. When my grandsons
were that age, | couldn't imagine it. But you make sacrifices for your kids. But | think it was
quite a sacrifice. Even if they did think they were going to get out, there must have been

something in the back of the mind thinking maybe I'm not going to get out.
>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.
>> Esther Starobin: | just think it's absolutely amazing. Many of the people went on the
Kindertransport never saw their parents again. We weren't unusual about that.
>> Bill Benson: And, of course, Herman did eventually get out. What do you know about
Herman's ability to leave Germany?
>> Esther Starobin: Herman, when my parents were sent to France in 1940, October 1940, he
went with them. They were in two camps, Gurs and Rivesaltes.
>> Bill Benson: He was with them.
>> Esther Starobin: He was with them in the camps. It was kind of interesting. In the stuff you
can get online now, you can find out lots of things. When he came to this country, it said he
could read French and German. And | always wondered where did he learn to read. In 1940
he was 7. 7,1 think. Did they have schools in the camps? How did he learn all of these
things? And he would never talk about it.

But the United States took in 1,000 children in 1941. And Herman came to this
country. And he landed in New York. He said -- he knew he had uncles. He didn't exactly
know where they were. But my uncles -- there's a German Jewish newspaper. They saw the
list of children. And somebody picked him up. And he lived with an aunt and uncle.
>> Bill Benson: So he was one of a group of 1,000 kids who were able to come over to the
United States.
>> Esther Starobin: Right. My aunt and uncle brought him up. In fact, he considered them his

parents, his children, until one of the cousins told him otherwise. They were really their
grandparents. He was very close. They had one other son. And they were a family.

It's pretty amazing. | didn't remember Herman at all. When we came to this country
and | had this other brother, | had brother number two.
>> Bill Benson: You told us a little bit about the letters that you had from your mother. So it
was not until the 1980s that you even have the opportunity to read those letters?
>> Esther Starobin: Right. When we first came to this country, | sort of thought, well, maybe
my parents would show up. But Bertle knew they were dead. | don't Know when | actually
knew. There were lists and that. She knew. We never talked about it.

My best friend all through high school and junior high, | wrote something for this
memoi?ir writing thing about being on the Kindertransport and | sent it to her. And she said all
the years she never knew that. | wrote that when | was in my 60s and | had known her since |
was about 13. | didn't actually know the name of how | knew | had this family and | knew |
went on the train and then | came here. But it's like separate parts of my life that weren't
connected Exactly.
>> Bill Benson: Of course, eventually, you would learn that the date, August 14, would have
particular significance.
>> Esther Starobin: Right. That was the day my parents were transported to Auschwitz and
murdered there.
>> Bill Benson: When did you find that out?
>> Esther Starobin: There's a French book that lists all the people that were in the camps,

where they were from and how old they were, when they were transported and the number of
the transported. | would say 15, 20 years. | think | knew it the first time | did this. It was fairly
recently when you're as old as | am.
>> Bill Benson: Yes. That is recent.

What do you know about the camps they were sent to before they went to
Auschwitz?
>> Esther Starobin: They were work camps. One of my aunts was also there because in one
of the letters my mother mentions that Aunt Tony was working in the kitchen and she could get
extra food for Herman who was always hungry, because they didn't get enough food.
Actually, when he first came here, my aunt told Bertle, when we came, that Herman
used to hide food all over the house because he was hungry, which makes sense; he was a
growing boy. He had a hell of a time, actually.
>> Bill Benson: You would live with the Harrison family as your Foster family in England from
the time you were age 2 until 10.
>> Esther Starobin: Right.
>> Bill Benson: So until 1947, the eight of the first 10 years of your life. Tell us about the
Harrisons and your life with them and then also having sisters in other parts of England and
one even in Scotland.
>> Esther Starobin: Ok. Well, the Harrisons were very devout, fundamentalist Christians.
And Uncle Harry -- | called them Auntie Dot and Uncle Harry, worked in a shoe factory owned
by a Jewish man. He put a sign was anybody willing to take a child. So that's how | got to be

with them. They had wanted a boy because they had one son, Allen, who's seven years older
than | am. But! came to live with them.

When | first got there, | had Scarlet Fever. So! was stuck in a bedroom. Allen used
to play with me through the window. But! was very much afraid --
>> Bill Benson: Because you were quarantined.
>> Esther Starobin: | was quarantined. [Laughter]

So | was very much afraid of Uncle Harry who was very soft-spoken. In all the years
| Knew him, he never raised his voice, but | was petrified of him which | think must have been
because | had heard loud voices. There must have been some connection between what had
happened.

But Allen was so good to me. | think about it. He was 9 and | was 2. And | came
and took over their family, kind of. And he didn't try to do me in or anything. He used to take
me around with him. He made sure | got to school. He was a terrific big brother.

They belonged to a fundamentalist chapel. Mr. Ramsey, who owned the chapel,
had helped them get some of the things they needed. Back then, when you were 2, you were
still a baby; so they helped them get some of the things they needed because the Harrisons
really didn't have a lot of money. And we went to the chapel there.

In many religions now the big thing is community, having community. Well, this
chapel had community. It had a lot of activities. | went to chapel with them. | don't know if
they tried to convert me. | don't think so but | didn't know much about being Jewish either.

get good grades. But! don't remember that. He's making it up.

[Laughter]

| don't know.

| really had a pretty happy childhood there. And | guess | knew | wasn't going to be
there forever, but | never asked questions. I'm not too good at questioning wherever | am,
whatever is happening.
>> Bill Benson: Generally, it was a happy childhood.
>> Esther Starobin: It was very happy. | had a gas mask that | had to carry around with me.
We had to get it checked. There were bombs. We had a bomb shelter we went into. That
was the way it was. My sisters came to visit periodically.
>> Bill Benson: Each of them were able to do that?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. | think it was mostly after the war that they came. My Aunt Hannah
came once, but there was a certain tension between Auntie Dot and Aunt Hannah. | think they
didn't gel too well.

One time -- my Aunt Hannah was very kosher. It was hard to get food during the
war. And one time Bertle got a chicken, but she couldn't get it killed because it had to be killed

kosher. She took the chicken back on the train in a box.

And one time we went to London to visit. | remember Allen and | going up and down
the escalators | guess in Harrah's or one of those stores because Norridge didn't have such
things. It was a big excitement to do that. But the Harrisons always welcomed my sisters. |
knew Aunt Hannah, but | didn't know any of the other people that my sisters lived with.
>> Bill Benson: As you had explained a little while ago, one of your sisters, at least one of
them, did not have a particularly happy foster situation.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: What about the other sisters? Edith joined the British Army.
>> Esther Starobin: To escape where she was. And Ruth, | never talked about it much with
Ruth. | don't know whether she thought of it as terrible or -- | don't know. If Tamar were here,
she would know.
>> Bill Benson: You told me one time about Edith had an experience as a member of the
British Army returning to Adelsheim.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. She went back to Germany after the war. She was walking down
the street in Germany. Somebody came up to her and said, "Adolph's daughter." She knew
exactly who she was. She looks, according to the picture, she looked a lot like my father. It's
a small place.

In fact, when we went back -- when Bertle and | went in 2000, people came up and
talked about helping my parents because they didn't get ration coupons and it was hard for
them to get food. And one man talked about his father putting -- leaving food after dark on

their doorstep. He said his wife was very upset because if they had gotten caught, it would not
have been good for their family. | said to Bertle, "Do you think that's true?"
>> Bill Benson: It would be easy to say.
>> Esther Starobin: After the war. She said yeah. There had been other letters, and my
mother mentioned it.

Another person talked about my parents would exchange something that was in the
house. Again, | said to Bertle, "Do you think it's true?" And she said yeah.

But | go back to when my parents were sent --
>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.
>> Esther Starobin: They were sent in 1940, as | said. When we went back to Adelsheim,
Reinhart gave us a copy of the order telling us they had to vacate within an hour or so. The list
that was in my house, it was so detailed it even listed the rags in the house. Unbelievable the
details.

The house was sold supposedly to pay a debt. Well, in 1936, someone had sued
my father saying that he had cheated them on -- something to do with a horse. But it was the
beginning of when the Nazis were taking the businesses away from the Jews. It wasn't
particularly true, but it got the business away.

>> Esther Starobin: Right.
>> Bill Benson: So you had a complete inventory of everything in the household.

The other interesting thing about this inventory, Bertle said they had a very fancy doll
in one of the rooms that they weren't allowed to touch. But that doll wasn't on the inventory.
So somebody had taken the doll.

When we went back, we walked by the house. We didn't go in, but | went back -- |
had been back before then. But Reinhart arranged for us to go in the house. It's beautiful. It
had been remodeled and this and that. But the thing that really got me -- my grandsons were
about 8, 9. | forget how old. But upstairs where the son lived, exact same that my grandsons
had but neat. Everything was in its place. Very German. Not the way my grandsons were.
>> Bill Benson: Which was very American.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. | was there with Renee's sister this summer. There's a program in
Germany to put stepping stones in front of houses that were owned by Jews. And the people
who are living there have to agree to it. And these people won't agree to it.
>> [Inaudible]
>> Esther Starobin: Could be. Yeah. When we went -- | forgot Renee was with us. She
went, too.
>> Bill Benson: In 1947, two years after the war has ended, your sister Bertle, your oldest
sister, arranges for you and your other sisters, except Edith who's in the Army, to leave
England and come to the United States. Will you tell us what you know about the decision to
do that, the arrangements, and what it was like for you to leave the Harrisons after eight
years?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. Well, my mother had told us we were all supposed to stay together

and come to the United States. There was something called Bloomsbury House.
>> Bill Benson: That was something she told Bertle?
>> Esther Starobin: In the letters.
>> Bill Benson: Take everybody when you can to the United States?
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Esther Starobin: So Bloomsbury has help with getting people on to ships. So Bertle got a
call one day that we could leave the next day. The Harrisons did not have a phone. Bertle
called the police in Norridge, and they came to the door of the Harrisons and told the Harrisons
they had to take me to London the next day because | was leaving.
>> Bill Benson: Was that the first they knew that?
>> Esther Starobin: They knew --
>> Bill Benson: They knew eventually it was going to happen.
>> Esther Starobin: Whenever there was room on the ship.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Esther Starobin: So Uncle Harry, of course, couldn't leave work. Allen was supposed to
get a big prize at school the next day, but he skips that. And Auntie Dot and they took me to
London and handed me over like a package. | was very much a package in all of this stuff.
We went to South Hampton to leave. We were on the Queen Mary, which had been used as a
troop ship. And then it was for this.
There was a strike. Apparently, which | didn't know at the time, but somebody from

the royal family was on the ship. So this was a good time to strike. But my aunt had given my
sister bread. And Bertle had a boyfriend who was a butcher, so we had sausage, food to eat.
And eventually we took off.

Well, | was so seasick and so miserable. | didn't want to leave. | wanted to stay
where | was.
>> Bill Benson: It had to be very painful for you.
>> Esther Starobin: It was awful. Allen tells me his mother's hair turned White overnight then.
He hadn't had white hair. So | guess it was a shock to them. They knew | had to leave, too.
But | had been there for a long time. | was very much a part of their family. They were my
family.

So we came to the United States. Two uncles met us in New York. Bertle knew one
of the uncles. The other was a married in American uncle.
>> Bill Benson: One of your relatives had left Germany in the mid 1930s. So it was part of
that family.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. So we lived with an aunt and uncle when we first came. They had
a big house. If you're a local person, North Capital Street has these big houses. We had one
room. There was another refugee family in another room. My aunt, my uncle, my aunt's
mother, two cousins. It was the worst experience I've had in my life. Most people when they
talk about the Kindertransport, they talk about going to England and living with families who
didn't love them and they had to work and do all of this stuff. Well, | had a great time in
England compared to here. My uncle had a bad temper and threw furniture around. My aunt

was crazy. Nowadays they'd have medicine for her but they didn't then.
[Laughter]
It was before the time that they had for people who were really mentally ill.
>> Bill Benson: You're 10 years old. It was just a very difficult transition.
>> Esther Starobin: | moved from the country to the city. | changed religions. | changed
schools. This school was very different. | had a really nasty teacher. And it was just totally
different. | had never been to a movie. The Harrisons didn't do movies. They didn't listen to
music. They didn't dance. They didn't wear makeup. And as an adult, some of that was
because they didn't have the money but | didn't know that.

So we lived with my aunt and uncle. | remember my uncle dragging me out trying to
make me go to the movies. | finally went to see "The Wizard of Oz" but | was here quite a
while before | did that.

lt was mean compared to where | had been in a loving family.
>> Bill Benson: What do you remember your education transition? There you were in the
English schools.
>> Esther Starobin: | didn't learn anything new for quite a while other than grammar. In
England, they didn't emphasize grammar. But |! didn't learn anything new.

Then | went to junior high and had a marvelous teacher in junior high. That was ok.
When my sister Edy got demarked from the British Army and came over, once she had a job,
Bertle had a job, they got an apartment. So here were these two young women trying to make
a new life in a new country. And they had me, my sister, Ruth, his mother, went to college.

And in those days she could work for room and board and tuition. She worked and paid for all
of it. So it was really different. My sisters at times were dating people who were teaching in
the school | went to.
>> Bill Benson: But you were living with your sisters at that point.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. We moved a lot, but we were living together. My sisters are pretty
unusual. They never said -- | graduated from high school when | was 16 because | had gone
to school in England. We were ahead. They never said to me when you graduate you have to
go to work. They expected me to go to college. That would never have happened in
Germany. It just wouldn't have.
>> Bill Benson: After you left England in 1947, were you able at that point to stay in touch with
the Harrisons?
>> Esther Starobin: My sisters made sure | did. | did. | wouldn't say | wrote a lot, but | did
write. They wrote back. So | did stay in touch with them.
>> Bill Benson: And you have continued a relationship with the family ever since.
>> Esther Starobin: | have. When my daughters were little, we went over to visit. | think it
was 1964. And then Allen got a Fulbright teaching -- he taught here for a year. At the end of
his year we brought his parents over for the summer. It was really interesting. They lived in
this very quiet life. No telephone. They didn't get a refrigerator until we went over and they got
this little thing which they unplugged as soon as we left. And they got on the airplane and
came here. It was just -- when | think about it, it was gutsy for them; about a month or so here.
Everybody visited them. We did a vacation in Toms River, New Jersey which Allen found for

us. It's the mosquito capital of the world. Don't go there.

lt was really special to have the Harrisons here and to be able to repay them a little
bit for what they had done for me. Auntie Dot died soon after that. Uncle Harry used to come
over in the summer for about six weeks. He loved coming over. And he loved going to
synagogue with us and to brotherhood. And what Allen found out since his father died, his
grandfather was Jewish. He was from the Ukraine. And he was Jewish, which is kind of
interesting; which kind of explains. Maybe there was something in his father's memory.
>> Bill Benson: And Allen still comes to this day. Right?
>> Esther Starobin: He does.
>> Bill Benson: You still stay in touch.
>> Esther Starobin: Very much so.
>> Bill Benson: You've mentioned, of course, that you went back to Adelsheim. Tell us a little
more about your trips back to Adelsheim and what that's like for you to go back to the place
where you left your parents.
>> Esther Starobin: The first time | went back was in the late 1980s. | needed to find out that |
didn't come from a black hole; | came from a real place. And we went back. Originally Bertle
and her husband were going to go, but Morris got sick and couldn't go. But Bertle had written
to them because she still remembers some German.

We got there. We got to Adelsheim. And there's no one, absolute -- not a person
anywhere. So we went to where we thought the town hall was. And it wasn't. -- it wasn't open.
Apparently it closes for lunch. Then we found the town hall. When we got there, there was no

one who spoke English. | don't speak German. We got them to understand why we were
there. They dug out the letter that Bertle had sent. They said that the wife of the assistant
Burgermeister spoke English. We arranged to meet with them the next day. They said: you
don't want to stay here overnight. You want to go somewhere, someplace else. | said, “No,
you're not sending me away again. I'm staying overnight.” So we stayed overnight.

| don't know what we ate because it was all in German. Probably something |
wouldn't have eaten if | had known what it was. That night, | had such a nightmare. | dreamt
that Nazis were coming up the steps to get me. It was really scary.

But the next day we met the people. There was a man called Mr. Weterhan who
had known my parents. He, at the time, was the man keeping track of the Jews and what had
happened. We went to the house. He showed us where the synagogue had been. We went
to the Jewish cemetery which was between that town and the next town. | had a lot of family
members there. There's a museum, which is opened on Sundays but they opened it, and we
saw that.

So | was glad to go there. | was also glad to leave there. But it didn't mean anything
to me. My sisters had told me some places to look for. | found those places. But | didn't feel a
connection. | felt like a tourist in a touristy place. It didn't mean much to me even though |
knew this was where | had been born and where my sisters had grown up.
>> Bill Benson: Did Bertle go back to Adelsheim?
>> Esther Starobin: A few years later. She really liked it. She could react to it.
>> Bill Benson: 12 years older than you were. So she would have remembered many things.

>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. His grandmother, Ruth, went with his sister once. They went back
once, too.
>> [Inaudible]
>> Esther Starobin: | can't see that far. [Laughter]

So they've been back. Quite a lot of us have actually been there. My kids haven't
been there. And then | was back in 2000 with Renee and Bertle. This past summer | was
there with Renee's sister just overnight.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit more about [Inaudible] who seems -- | mean Reinhart, I'm
sorry, who is such -- why does he know so much?
>> Esther Starobin: Reinhart is really an interesting man. When Bertle first met him, when
she went back the first time she met him. | figured | wasn't going to like him. He was German.
Right? But then he came to visit. He's really a very charming man. But he taught at the local
high school.
>> Bill Benson: In Adelsheim?
>> Esther Starobin: In Adelsheim. He said, “It's your turn. You take over.” He had an after
school club. They did a lot of research. And just as | wanted to know things about Germany,
the other people who left Germany had contacted him. So he has kept track of most of the
people -- well, there weren't so many, but he has contact. Many people have been back.

We discovered a cousin, a cousin five times removed, whose grandfather and our grandfather
| think were brothers. Peter. Lives in Ireland. So we have contact with him. He wrote to
Bertle and said | think I'm your cousin and this kind of thing.

But Reinhart has really gotten involved. He set up a museum in what used to be the
synagogue. He knows a lot about Judaism. He visits the synagogue. And the Jewish tradition
is to put a little stone on the grave if you visit. And he does that.
>> Bill Benson: So he's sort of become the keeper of the memories.
>> Esther Starobin: Definitely. Definitely.

And my mother came from Rexingen. There's somebody there -- Tamar just got
here. There's someone in Rexingen that I've gotten some contact with. They have a cemetery
where many of my mother's family were buried. It's really interesting. This man who's written
a book about the Jewish cemetery, who all the people were totally cataloged, when he finished
that, the rest of the cemetery is crusaders. He was going to do a thing on the crusaders and
what different groups of people in that.

So Reinhart really cares a lot. He's done these family trees for each of the Jewish
families. He probably knows more about our family than | do, actually. When we went back in
2000, they had a program to mark the commemoration. No government money in it. He had
exhibits about each of the families, photocopies. It wasn't slick, but it was very informative,
very complete. And they had a lovely program, most of which was in German so | didn't
understand it. But I've had it translated since then. But there were police outside. They
thought there might be skinheads there, which was a little unnerving. And there were a lot of
people at the program. We went because we thought they should have some Jews there. So
we were there. | found it very moving. There were various ages of people there.

Don't you think?

>> [Inaudible]
>> Esther Starobin: What Renee said, that Reinhart said he was very committed to keeping
the story of the Jews alive and what happened to them. He is collecting all of this to write a
book. In the meantime, he and someone else have collaborated on a book about the Jewish
cemeteries. He is very committed. In the meantime, he's had some grandchildren, so he's not
quite as committed.
>> Bill Benson: We have a little bit of time, Esther to turn to our audience to ask -- have them
ask you a few questions if they wish. Are you ready for that?
>> Esther Starobin: As long as you repeat the question.
>> Bill Benson: We have a question right here. Try to make it as brief as you can. We have a
microphone | think right here. Just in case we don't hear it or people in the back don't hear it
lll try my best to repeat the question.
>> Thank you for sharing your story. Have you been able to forgive the people who did this to
you and your family?
>> Bill Benson: The question is, for those who might not have heard: Have you been able to
forgive the people who did this to you and your family?
>> Esther Starobin: It doesn't help me to be angry at them. | think there were some very evil
people. Am | still angry? No. Am | hurt? Yes. They're two different things.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Esther.

We're going to bring the mic down to you right here behind you. The people in the
back might not. So that helps. There we go.

>> You said your father lost his leg during the First World War. Did he serve in the German
Army?
>> Esther Starobin: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Did your father serve in the German Army in the First World War?
>> Esther Starobin: He did. He had been training to be a baker. Of course he couldn't do that
because bakers have to stand up a lot and he couldn't do that anymore. He had a medal of
some sort which he thought would help him. But, of course, it didn't.
>> Bill Benson: Do we have any other questions? While some may be thinking of another
question, | was going to ask. You've learned more recently or at some point that there were
other Kindertransport children | think in the same town of Norridge.
>> Esther Starobin: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Did you know any of that when you were young?
>> Esther Starobin: | didn't know any of that. Apparently there were about 200 in that general
area, but part of not knowing was probably because the Harrisons weren't Jewish so they
weren't connected into the Jewish community. And | don't know if there was any effort to help
people to know other kinder in the area. But there's an organization now, Kindertransport
organization. And one of the men who was president of it at one point was from Norridge. So
at some point Allen said, well, maybe we could find who he lived with. | said we'll look in the
phone book. So we did visit her. They also had a very close relationship. | kept up the
relationship over the years. | don't know how true that is for most Kinder because a lot of them
were pretty bitter about who they lived with.

>> Bill Benson: It's good to know that you had some folks that you've gotten to know that were
in the same community as you.
>> Esther Starobin: Yeah. When | was a kid, | didn't know anybody else would have this
experience. | think the first time my sisters and | went to a conference for the Kindertransport,
it was like, oh, there are other people who had this kind of thing.

You didn't ask me this, but one of the things -- my sister Bertle doesn't think we're
really survivors. And as | said to Bertle, we had to leave our country, my parents were killed, |
don't even remember them, all of these things happened to me. It's not as terrible as people
who were in camps or in hiding, but it certainly was something not to be repeated.
>> Bill Benson: | don't -- oh, there is. There we go. Back in the far --
>> Thank you for sharing your story with us. I'm a middle school principal. I'm here with 150
kids from the Cleveland area. | see a lot of kids from around the country. | have a question for
you. What's the greatest message that you can give to these young people as they prepare to
enter the world as young adults and as citizens of our country? Certainly the issue of bullying
is prevalent in our schools. | think you really have something that you could share with them.
>> Bill Benson: You heard that ok?
>> Esther Starobin: | did hear that. | taught middle school. | love middle school.

| think for me the fact that you can help one person ripples off. | was so lucky
because individual people helped me and loved me and did things. And | think most of us are
not going to affect hundreds and thousands of people, but we can help one person. We can
stand up to someone who is doing awful things to another person. And we can do it one

person ata time.

And | think as middle school kids, too, to know the history, to Know the history of our
country and the changes that have come about in our country is important, too. Because we
just assumed life was like it was now. And | know some of the things | think are recent are
ancient history to middle school kids. They need to know we still need to look out for
everybody and to appreciate people who are different from us. And certainly as our country is
changing and we're become a much more mixed country, it's important to do that.
>> Bill Benson: | think we have time for one more question. | think there was a hand up here.
Yes. We're going to bring you the mic.
>> When you were -- when you were with the Harrisons, did you hear anything about the war?
>> Bill Benson: When you were with the Harrisons, did you hear anything about the war that
was going on?
>> Esther Starobin: Not a lot because | never heard the radio. But on the other hand, | had a
gas mask and we had to get it tested and there were planes flying over, dropping bombs. So
yes and no. Not like now when you listen to the radio and you hear all the news. | didn't hear
it that way. | lived it.
>> Bill Benson: Ok. Thank you all for really great questions. Thanks, everybody.

[Applause]

I'm going to turn back to Esther in a moment to close our program. | want to thank
all of you for being with us today. | remind you that we will have First Person programs every
Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. We hope you can come back at some

point if not this year in subsequent years. The website does include information about each of
our upcoming First Person guests.

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person has the last word. Before | turn
to Esther to do that, | want to remind you that when she finishes, she's going to step off the
stage and head up toward the entrance where she will be available to sign copies of "Echoes
of Memory" which she has made contributions to. That could be an opportunity also to say hi
to her and meet her personally in that way.

With that I'd like to turn to Esther to close our program.
>> Esther Starobin: And I'd like to repeat what | said. | think the individual acts that we can do
of kindness, of helping people to stand up for what's right, really are important and we need to
continue to do that or to start doing it if we're not doing it.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Esther, very much.
