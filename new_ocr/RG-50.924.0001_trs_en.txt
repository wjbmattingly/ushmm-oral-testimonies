October 2007

[Tape 1]

Q: Your name and age.

A: My name is Sam Schalkowsky or Schalkowsky. I am now 82 years old.

Q: And where are we?

A: We’re in Chevy Chase, Maryland, suburb of Washington.

Q: And in your home?

A: Yes. We’re in our home, here in Chevy Chase.

Q: Tell me when you first started to talk about your wartime experiences.

A: I think it’s been a long period of time, which— (and I’m not unique to that) right
after the war, where there wasn’t much said. There was a sense that it really—
people didn’t want to hear too much about it. So it could have been, oh, at least
maybe something like 20 years before it was acceptable or desired. And I think that
had mostly to do with a new generation displaying an interest in it. So it would
have been— And the first time actually I talked to, would have been either in this
unaffiliated group that we belong to, that I might have spoken to them, and—or our
daughters, one of them in high school perhaps. Susan’s high school class was
interested. So that would have been around 1970 or thereabouts. That would have
been the earliest time.

Q: How important was that for you, to start to talk about it?

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape | SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 2

A: It was important for me in terms of realizing that the people wanted to hear it. And
certainly, of course, our daughter. That was a big deal (you know) for the whole-— to
appear before her own class. So it was more in terms of what it meant to the
audience than for my own need or desire to-to relate this particular period of my
experience.

Q: What about your own need and desire? Was there a point earlier in your life where
you did need and want to talk about it, but didn’t?

A: I ...d frequent (you know) talking about it. I never really looked for it. I responded
to people’s interest. It’s changed most recently, I think, when I started to change
my attitude as to what it is I was trying to accomplish by talking about it. But all
along, I preferred to minimize the frequency of my talking. I kind of had a feeling
that if you keep repeating the same thing, it changes the actual story; that basically
the-the experience first becomes a story, and then the story becomes the experience.
And I didn’t particularly like that.

Q: What were your concerns? What didn’t you like about that?

A: It’s— (you know) the— To begin with, I have blocked out a great deal of the details
of my experiences, those— particularly those that were most unpleasant. So as time
goes on, what-what I was reading about and hearing about other people and the
books and things that was published, somehow some pieces of that become
interwoven in my own talking about my experience. And so I was kind of
concerned that it’s really the connection between the actual past and the past as I
saw and read about it, was being not-not in good— not a good connection. So I-I
tended to minimize—

Q: Tell me again the worry about blurring those lines.

A: My concern was that as time went by, and I was hearing and reading more about
this period, what was going on, and especially as I found some documentation from

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape | SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 3
other survivors, who were perhaps in the same places, that because I had blocked
out so much of my own details, I was beginning to incorporate what I read as
though it was my experience. Now, sometimes, whenever I could, like in a recent
talk where I quoted from other documents that were describing what was going on
at the particular period, that was clear. I was not talk—saying it was my experience,
but it was my background. But I was concerned, and I still am (you know)
concerned, that probably too many details that I might now relate as being my own
experiences are really experiences | relived or rejuvenated from what I have heard
and read.

Q: So was the concern that you want to get it right, or that you were growing more
distant from your actual memories?

A: I think that in my case there 1s another aspect to it that fits into it. And that is that I-
I get— I wouldn’t say bored, but not that interested in repeating the same thing again
and again if I do it too often. So these two things together, and perhaps other things,
deterred me from accepting or certainly not offering to have many-many talks
about it. (Yeah.)

Q: But it’s more than just getting bored, your issue about the inevitability of blurring
memories, that’s a complicated issue to the value and purpose of testimony.

A: Well, it’s in the— 1n-in the purpose. First of all, because of the way I’ve (you know)
I-I operated, I work, I need something new, to bring in something new, in whatever
I’m doing, whenever I can. It’s been my (you know) professional experience to do
that. I have something like 13 patents to my name, and all the time looking for
basically innovation to solve a problem. So to just do this without looking for
something new was not very interesting for me. So it’s when I find a way to
combine this need for something new, something useful hopefully, that I started to-
to accept, especially from the museum in most recent years, to-to accept the
opportunity. And certainly other work that I was doing in the museum, it’s because
I was— I was— I could use my mind, basically.

Tape | SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 4

Q: When you have told your story over the years, you lose your own past?

A: In a sense. It’s interesting that I— if I have spoken to our-our group that we belong
to (and that’s now some years ago), I did that because it fitted into the series that
they were having, education kind of series, like the creation of the state of Israel
and what was my own experience, was to highlight the time. That-that helped. But
it was that particular need, and also in what I did in the archives in my first
assignments, was-was not that routine. When it becomes routine, I lose interest.

Q: Did you have a personal need, after having survived, to tell others about 1t?

A: Not-not much. No, not much. Of course when-when the people you deal with and
you relate to, you don’t like to have a hidden history. So when opportunities came
in more intimate relationships, friendships with other people, that I didn’t mind
relating some of these things, provided I could— I could sense an interest. But that
was the main reason. And of course there is— When there is an interest, you kind
of— you tend to make yourself important by showing up this kind of thing. And I’m
sure this played some role. But no-no driving interest to actually go and spread the
word, like people keep telling me (you know) I should write a book, with such an
interesting background, such adventures. I-I don’t get interested in doing that at all,
simply because I can see that so much of it is being done. So what’s one more
story? It’s doesn’t (you know) add that much to it. So unless I can find another
purpose, I don’t dwell on this story. In general, I don’t dwell on the past—not just
my experience during the war years, but even more recent experiences in other
areas. I tend not to dwell on the past; try to focus, look for some purpose, some-
something of interest in my present environment.

Q: Has that always been the case for you?

A: I think so. I think so.

Q: It’s just a sense of who you are, or your way to keep moving forward?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 5

A: Well, in the case of— I really don’t know. Just I know that that’s the way I tend to
be.

Q: You said the world wasn’t particularly interested when you first came?

A: Well, the world, meaning the people around you. They participated in one way or
another in the World War II- in our experience, however remote to-to these— to my
experience. And it was too close and too unpleasant, and I think they just didn’t
want themselves, they didn’t want to dwell on it. Just like I didn’t want to dwell on
the past, people in general, I think, immediately after the war, didn’t want to do
that. Not exclusively, but I think there was the general sense.

Q: There’s a sense in contemporary America that unless one deals with the past, one
doesn’t move forward. What is your sense.

A: I can— I can accept it as a desirable and necessary (you know) point of view. But
that is separate and distinct from how I was. I think I’ve changed since I’ve been at
the museum, after I retired, that I can rationally, logically see the need for such
purpose, to disclose. And (1) that influences my responding to talks. Now I am
officially part of the Speakers Bureau, but it doesn’t mean that I talk every week or
repeat myself. I still try to keep that to kind of a modest frequency.

Q: When and why did you join the museum, and what happened?

A: I joined the museum as a volunteer basically after I retired. I retired in 1998, and
here I am always interested in doing something, hopefully something productive,
something new, and the question is what I was going to do. I thought that my work
the last period in-in my— 1n our own business, where I was (excuse me) very much
involved in new developments in our area (this microbiological testing), that I
would want to continue with it, because I could see there 1s a lot of need there. But
I very quickly found out that I was out of it, that this was no longer my
environment. And being an engineer, I was not really immediately considered part

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 6
of the microbiological community. So I needed to— I abandoned that altogether
within probably like six months, and started to look around. So I volunteered at the
Holocaust Museum here in Washington, and I— because of my knowledge of
languages (I know Yiddish and I know Hebrew, and I think, some English), they
assigned to me at the archives a recently received collection from Kovno, which is
where I come from in Lithuania. And I found that Yiddish, even though I had not
spoken or used it for close to 60 years, that it was still there; and I could be
refreshing it and applying it usefully to this document collection, because it
happened to be from Kovno, which is— And I was like in the Kovno ghetto. So that
got my interest, and this led to a number of projects over the years that kept me
interesting—interested.

Q: What happened when you stepped into that world?

A: Well, the first- One thing that I mentioned is to discover my knowledge or
awareness or— of Yiddish, of the language. But to me, Yiddish was— I knew it
because it was spoken at home, but it was not central to my life as I was growing
up, because I belonged to a Zionist organization and where Hebrew was the
language of discourse, and I attended a Hebrew gymnasium, which means
everything was taught in Hebrew. So literature was Hebrew literature. So Yiddish,
I-I could see— I could re-recover it, just by working at it.

And of course the test came when I came across this one document in this— It
was the—a collection of documents from the Kovno ghetto police. And I had some
encounters with the ghetto police when I was there briefly. So that kind of was of
interest. And what they were describing in this document, which was in Yiddish,
quite extensive, typewritten, 250 pages, what they called a History of the Kovno
Ghetto Jewish Police, that they were describing this what was going on, and some
of it obviously rang a bell, even though I had really blocked out some of the
unpleasant details, or even re— normal details, but— So it was bringing back my
background, and it was shedding a different light on how I was thinking about it.
And I thought that this document in particular, because it was treated not very well

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 7
in the Holocaust literature— Actually only one historian who was excerpt-
excerpting from it and writing about it; I thought he had a very wrong point of
view, even though he also came from the Kovno ghetto. So I thought that this
document had to be— had to become public, that it was an important addition to
describing what life actually was like in— from a people’s point of view, in, say, in
the Kovno ghetto, and by-by extension, to in other places which had similar
conditions.

Q: Was your discovery of your own past emotional for you? Was it exciting?

A: [overlap] Yes, 1t was exciting. I don’t know if it was emotional. Some of the
detailed description which corresponded to my description might have been
emotional. But when you work at it for a while and repeat (you know) this going
through these experiences, the emotional aspect tends to be reduced.

So I embarked on translating it. Now, this was not as part of the-my museum
activities, because I decided that on my own. So I made this my— another project of
my own. And I would say that in-in the process of doing it, I recovered a good part
of my Yiddish knowledge, because it was not there but it had to be retraced,
whether it’s through dictionaries or through participating in reading groups. So it
served these two purposes—one intended, the other one not—that I did translate. It
took me a couple years.

Q: You said it shed new light on your own experience. What did that mean?

A: Well, I can illustrate it. I and my mother were taken off the street in the Kovno
ghetto by a Jewish policeman, following the directive from the elder council and
the Nazi rulers .. to provide them like 500 workers for the re— for the Riga ghetto
(Riga, the capital of Latvia, not that far from Kovno). And of course nobody
volunteered for that, because there has not— had not been any selections until that
time. They did not end in the ditches of the Ninth Fort, which was the killing
grounds of the Kovno ghetto.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 8

So the police picked up people wherever they could, and my mother and I
didn’t manage to escape them. And they took us down to this—the square, the center
square in the ghetto, where they were collecting those to be transported to Riga.
And in-in that square, there was the detail of the Jewish policemen which was led
by a man called Michael Bronson, who happened to be my high school teacher of
Lithuanian just 6 or 9 months before that. And I knew him personally because we
had extracurricular connections. And so I thought, “Well, he’ll— he can help me.
(you know) He knows me.” And he didn’t. Didn’t do anything. And my mother and
I were taken away. So I kind of— (you know) I held it against him. I says, “How- (I
mean) I’m not just anybody. I’m his student, his pupil.”

Well, reading what was actually happening, how this-this transport was
assembled, there’s nothing he could do, because the SS were right there with him,
and he— I thought that 1t was his job to select who would go and who wouldn’t go,
and that was not true either. Everybody who was collected was going to go. So it-it
illustrated that my perspective at the time was anything but complete on the
background, what was going on. And there are some other instances like that.

Q: Emotionally, does your feeling of betrayal change by that discovery? What do you
do with that psychologically?

A: Well, what-what’s changed is that— What this document was describing, and
supplemented by other documents, is that the-the issues dealt with by people like,
say, in the ghetto police, in the elder council, in the labor office, are not as simple
as it might appear. And people would take a position like I did, (you know) that
these were traitors, (you know) they just didn’t care about anybody else. And yet
when you read it, you find out that it’s not that simple. And for that reason I felt it
needed to be publicized so people can make their own decisions by getting both
sides of the story. And that’s what prompted me to try to push this project forward.

Q: Has that generally been the case, that as you’ve aged and learned more, that your
perspective on your experience has changed?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 9

A: Probably, probably, yes.

Q: How?

A: [overlap] Well, I think it changed fundamentally in this way: that for a while,
immediately after the war and some time, this-the purpose seemed to be to describe
what was going on. So to relate atrocities and to give people a sense just how awful
this thing was, was the— was the purpose of-of talking about. See. So you look what
(you know) hatred and bias can bring about. But I think when I got involved in it
more deeply, at the museum, it changed in this respect: that I thought it’s not as
simple a-a historical event that could be reduced to the extent of the atrocities.
There is more to it. And particularly if you want to try to understand it, which is not
simple, you have to look further and deeper into it. Not— I can’t say I have the
answer, but I know that it needs to be addressed more than just relating just what
happened.

Q: For you, what is your sense?

A: Well, it’s only a sense of what I can do. I mean, I cannot prescribe what everybody
else should do, or the— what those that make policy on it should do. But it changed,
but in part because of my other interests in dealing with it. Like I mentioned, it had
to be— I had to address something— a new angle or something before I was
interested in dealing with it, whether it’s to publish something or to talk about it. So
it was the need for this new angle that brought me, for example now, as of my most
recent (you know) talk that I gave, that I [would] not going to focus on my
experiences; that my experiences are the background for what I want to talk about,
but what I decided I would explore a little more is the people that I encountered in—
during my experiences. Because there are these broad categorizations of (you
know) perpetrators and collaborators and bystanders and so on and so on, that are
much too broad. They don’t bring up real people and try to shed some light: how
did they— how did they become what they became? And so this is what I-I did last
time, and this gives me the added interest that I need to keep talk about it, because

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 1 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 10
it’s a new angle and it’s not (you know) just my experience, and how good or bad it
was, but the particular people. And there are a variety of them. And they do or they
don’t fit in these categories that I thought might be more useful in trying to
understand at least some aspects of how the Holocaust came about.

[Tape 2]

Q: Discovering your own past through these documents, you had to rethink your
experiences. Did that affect not only the nature of your testimony at the museum,
but personally—

A: Of course it did. But I think you need-— it need to be looked at from two different
perspectives. One is the-the rational, the logical thing. (you know) Did I actually
(you know) experience this? And on that part (you know) you can conclude that
yes, it brings something back, but it does not really affect me that much. But on an
emotional level, it does. It could bring back the fears or the anxieties associated
with those experiences. And that can show up in any number of ways. The concern
that something bad is about to happen, that you can get that sense for no-no good
reason, really. But any event that you start worrying about (you know) suddenly
can get out of proportion. And of course in the dreams that you get, the nature of
these dreams become more disturbing. So these are two different— Rationally, I
read about it and I say, “Yeah, it’s— I was there.” But I don’t feel the (you know)
the pain that I must have felt when somebody hit me then. That I don’t feel. That’s
history. But emotionally, it’s—it does bring things back.

Q: What did you do with that? You were just prepared to take that on in your life?

A: Well, yeah. For one thing, I would spread my activities out. Now, not do it for too
long a period of time, but just cut it off and just go away from it for a while. And
that helps, and coming back, because I was convinced that it needed to be done.

Q: Are your Holocaust experiences always in your dream world?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 11

A: No, no. Not now. But I should say something that has changed in the last year,
which I don’t normally announce because some people, there is a stigma attached
to it. For-for a while when I was working on this, and being— (you know)
volunteering at the Holocaust Museum, and being retired makes a big difference,
because when you’re not retired, when you’re involved in all kinds of activities that
are very important to you, whether professionally or from a livelihood point of
view, that’s a great distraction. You don’t— You don’t have time or interest to dwell
on these things. But when you’re retired, these distractions are not there, which
some people say that that makes the golden years, but I doubt that. So the
distractions are not there, and then add to this that what I chose as a replacement for
it is to work on Holocaust matters. So it was a bad combination. And (f) so there
was some kind of depression that would lurk in the background, and every now and
then (you know) come out more strongly. So I consulted some medical people, and
I ended up about a year ago on what is called, I guess, an antidepressant. And that
makes a big difference. So there is a medical way to deal with it.

Q: One survivor said that as he grows older, he’s become much more emotional, more
vulnerable.

A: Well, the only parallel I can see here is the fact that (you know) these other
distractions are not there, and 1t depends what you’re doing. If you’re not involved
in Holocaust matters, the emotional things are not likely to be that much affected.
But if you focus on it, they are very likely to do so.

Q: Were you surprised by the depression?

A: It’s not— It’s not a matter of surprised, I don’t think. It’s just something that’s there,
and you don’t know how to get rid of it. It’s— And it-it interferes with life and your
relationships to people, especially your close people. And I didn’t like it.

Q: Working at the museum, how did you feel about testifying or telling your story?
When did you decide, beyond the manuscript work, talk publicly?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 12

A: Well, it depends on the situation, the particular situation. As I said, I did not seek
[him] out. But when this opportunity somehow showed up, where people asked me,
it [dependent/depended] on who I was going to talk to and what I think I was trying
to accomplish by it. And it had a lot to do with what I said before about what it did
for me or didn’t do for me, whether I was interested in doing it or not.

Q: Do you have friends who are Holocaust survivors?

A: Yes. Now of course with them, throughout the years, even during the early years
when nobody wanted to hear it, you get a number of Holocaust survivors who—
especially who were at the same places (which is what tends to be the case), and all
they’re going to talk about is their experiences and the people in it and so on. But
they’re aging, some of them have passed away, some are no longer in the best
mental state, so it’s changed. But even so, I think the tendency during— if
opportunities when we get together, is to-to talk about the experience.

Q: For you, has it been important to have that?

A: Not-not particularly, but I was interested when the opportunities came up, at least
to listen if not to participate in detail.

Q: When you now talk about your experience in terms of key people who shaped your
experience, what have you gleaned and how do others respond?

A: The response, I don’t know. I suspect— I only had really two occasions to use this
approach. And the last one, this conversation, I thought there was a great deal of
interest, at least the way people expressed it afterwards in terms of my autographs
and whatnot, [take] pictures with me— And I suspect it was because of this angle, in
addition perhaps to the particular experiences, personal experiences that I bring in
as the background for it. So this is my— It’s limited experience, but I think it’s of
interest. And that’s what encourages me (you know) to perhaps continue along this

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 13
line. I don’t know how long Ill be doing this before I get bored with it and say,
“Let’s find another angle.” But I think it can go for-for a while.

Q: It’s more challenging, I suppose.

A: It’s-it’s more challenging. It’s— presumably involves the people, the audience, in
thinking about this, not just hearing your nice adventure story, especially if there’s
a happy ending. But it gets them involved hopefully in thinking about it—not that I
offer answers. I can’t. So that-that helps.

Q: It makes the evil of the Holocaust less “other.”

A: I hope it-it makes it more human, this-this evil. There are people that (you know)
perhaps a lot of us can identify with, and can only wonder, (you know) how did
they wander off in this direction and became such willing participants? They’re not
all monsters, although there are some who are, and they-they produce the bad
stories of what people experienced.

Q: But that they are not all monsters is a more complicated and horrifying story.

A: Yes, right. Yes, it is. It 1s.

Q: You ’ve dealt with that in your own life, trying to deal with that complexity?

A: I haven’t, really. I haven’t really, until— not until recently. Not until after I retired.

Q: Tell me more.

A: Well, let’s say it’s the-the diversion of other interests and needs (you know) of
doing what one does, (you know) whether in— professionally for—to produce
income and so on. And when that is gone, that you-you’re open to-to this sort of
(you know) recollections.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 14

Q: Was your world view more bifurcated before?

A: I— The few opportunities that I had to speak about my experiences, I tried to
describe the details. Whenever possible, if 1t was (you know) horrors-horror kind of
stuff, I would try not to draw upon my own experiences, mostly because I did not
retain them. So I would use, like in one instance, excerpts from-from this
document, this manuscript from the ghetto police. They were describing what was
going on, and I could say, “Yes, I experienced this, but I’m not describing it. Here-
here it 1s.” (you know) Was another-nother instance, trying to remember, where I
did the same kind of a thing. I quoted somebody else, somebody else’s description,
even though it matched my background. But I wasn’t describing my experience
specifically, just showing the connection to it.

Q: Clearly there’s something protective about that.

A: Absolutely, right. [ Yes.] Especially if you’re concerned about your emotional-
emotional reactions. I-I didn’t— I wanted to avoid that. And I think by now, I can,
because I’ve done it a number of times. So the emotional level goes more into the
background.

Q: It is in some way, I suppose, easier to deal with documents and translations.

A: Not necessarily easier.

Q: No, that’s—

A: Not necessarily.

Q: Maybe less threatening of something emotionally, though.

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 15

A: Well, you can stop reading. (you know) If it— If it goes too-too deep or you don’t
like it, you stop it. You can go back to it. But it doesn’t leave you. (you know) If-if
there is a connection to your experiences, it does not go away.

Q: It must be more than diversions and distractions. Is it that you’re ready to
understand something about your own experience now?

A: Well, it’s not just the distractions. It’s that associated with these distractions was a
desired objective. Like if I have a need (you know) to try and develop something
new to be productive in some way, that was an important part of the— what we’d
refer to as the earlier professional kind of distractions or family needs. So it’s-it’s
that part that goes away, and now you’re looking for a replacement for it. What can
I do (you know) that maybe is new? It’s not (you know) that (you know) known,
and would be useful. So— And I was working in the— in the Holocaust area. So I
naturally ended up doing just that, looking for like— There’re other small kind of
things that happened, like in this manuscript. It’s been moving very slowly in the
publication area. The Holocaust Museum presumably is trying to publish it, but it’s
not at the top of their agenda.

And there is another complication that came about with it, in that there was a
man who also was in the Kovno ghetto, decided that his uncle, who he lived with in
the ghetto, is the author of this whole manuscript, because he saw him sitting at the
typewriter at night. And that was standing in the way of the museum moving ahead.
(you know) They had to somehow sort it out or make a deal with him or something.
And so I started to look into the manuscript in a lot more detail for the purpose of
trying to identify a little better who produced this document. And I think I
succeeded in showing, with some kind of factual information—from page
sequences, from looking at this document almost page by page, and finding out
wherever there was a reference to when this particular page was written, to produce
a timeline of the creation of this document, all kinds of background information for
it. And I think— I came to the conclusion, which I think is reasonable, that this was
not a one-man (you know) operation; that this was an organized effort of the police

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 16
department, starting from the top. And there is, I think, good— I wouldn’t say
justification, but good— You can make the connection and show that this is really
what it was. And I thought, here is something. I was able to come up with
something new, and it was also useful here. So there are opportunities like that. But
that’s the sort of thing I would be looking for.

Q: When one is reconstructing the memories of traumatic experiences, is it surreal at
the same time? What’s the complex of emotions?

A: [overlap] It’s this question of (you know) how did you survive, and all that, that
invariably comes up, and I don’t have a exact answer. Perhaps every time it’s
asked, I come up with a different possibility. I think at one time I was interviewed
and I said that it’s— having friends was important, that you can’t survive by
yourself. And that’s, I think, an important ingredient. But I would also say that
there’s something else more fundamental that’s involved, and that is the-the desire
to live, the need to live. Is nothing rational about it. I think to me, I’m not in that
particular branch of science, but I would say it’s like in your DNA. And you can’t
help yourself that you struggle, because otherwise, if you look what people went
through, and for how long they went through, and still looked for ways (you know)
to survive the day, I think there’s a lot to that, that— And then of course everybody
will say luck plays a role. But you have to put yourself in a position where luck can
play a role. So I think this drive is-is there, and it was there to many people.
Whether they used it to [deny] people being taken to a— to the extermination camps,
and they know that’s where they’re going, and they have no way—

Q: The primal quality of survival.

A: Well, this— That there is a irrational angle to attempting to survive. And like I was
starting to say about the people I read, that in eastern Poland, that were— they were
told, there’s going to be three transports, certain dates, and of course the Nazis
wouldn’t say where it was going, but it was well known to the people that they’re
heading for the extermination camp, whether it was Treblinka or what have you.

And they described that there was no great emotional outbursts; that they were
going about packing their things. What should they take? What shouldn’t they
take? And their rationale was that it just couldn’t be that-that they would be taken
by other human beings and just killed. So there must be (you know) something else
that would happen. There had to be a rational basis for doing what they were doing,
and here they were doing nothing because there’s nothing that they could do.

So if you take that (you know) into other situations, I have (you know) my own
examples, like when we were taken from Kovno to Riga, at the-this assembly
place, when I saw my teacher, I kind of shouted to him, although I’m not very loud.
I said that I wanted to live. And he of course didn’t hear any of it. But my mother
was-was standing next to me, and I’m sure she heard. So that when we were on our
way to-to the railroad station, we’re going up a hill there in town, I heard her going
behind me, and at one spot she says, “Run,” (you know) “run.” And I looked at
what she was pointing at, and I saw this street of Lithuanians going about their
daily business, and it didn’t look like an environment that is conducive to escape. I
didn’t know any Lithuanians; the ones I knew or heard about were not friendly; so I
didn’t run. I thought, maybe there will be other opportunities. Maybe this is indeed
not the selection of the known variety. And so there was this rational kind of almost
risk assessment. (you know) Is this a reasonable risk to take? And in my mind it
wasn’t. And some friends who later heard about it, who’re in the psychology
business, said I wasn’t ready to abandon my mother—which all of this may be true.
But there was a— some rational aspect to it.

On the other hand, at the end of the war, when I did escape from-from the
column that were being marched out of Magdeburg, and that was a reasonable risk,
because we knew that the Americans are already nearby, and the Russians are
nearby, and there’s a fair chance (you know) that if we managed to escape, that this
would be successful. So there is not only the will, the need, the desire to live, but
there is a rational approach (you know) to choosing the risks that you’re taking or
not taking. And many people of course who had the same desire to survive maybe
chose risks that weren’t good. And others didn’t choose at all, gave up. So there is
this— again this-this complexity. But I think the fundamental need that needs to try

Tape 2 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 18
to survive is there. And you can see that in poor countries and— where people put
up with an awful lot of unpleasantness, just to live. Not a very good life, but they
need— they want to live.

Q: Those two scenes are very different. In the first (“I want to live’), did that just
come out of you?

A: [overlap] (Yeah. It just came out.) I was trying to connect to my former teacher,
because he wasn’t doing anything.

Q: Had you known, until that moment, that you had that instinct for survival?

A: No, I never analyzed it. You don’t— No, you’re not that analytical in those
circumstances.

Q: In terms of your survival itself, did you learn early on that there were things you
were and weren’t going to do in order to survive? It’s interesting that you say you
can’t survive without friends—

A: That’s in retrospect.

Q: Okay. But there are those who you could imagine wouldn’t want any friendships or
relationships. So for you, did that just turn out to be your way of survival?

A: Well, it turned out that way because I think it’s-1t’s more-more universal. So that
there’re all these other young people who also needed friends, and they looked who
they can relate to, and that’s how this so-called friendships ..... relationships
materialize. So .. I found this one man in-in Magdeburg who-— Sam Isaacson, who—
we escaped together. And then he later told me there was a third fellow there too
with us. But he was then instrumental in finding that American captain who put me
into this German hospital. Without that, I would not have survived. And there’re
other instances like it, but—

[Tape 3]

Q: In general terms, what role did friendship play for you in terms of your survival?

A: You mean, talking about the past?

Q: Yes, the past.

A: Well, I-I find this individual instances where friendship played a key role. I find
other instances where just luck played a key role. It was, I think, all there. [uA—] I
think my mother’s presence [played] a key role.

Q: Would you say that again?

A: My mother’s present during these years, I think, played a key role. And I think, if I
had to analyze it, she was one of the people, if not the person, who gave me the-the
notion, the realization that my life is important. She wanted me to survive. She
helped me in certain very definite ways. Whereas that, I think, is-is a key
ingredient. If all you see around you is that how worthless you are, you might tend
to— not to be as active in looking after yourself, more likely to give up. And she
was-— she was not with me throughout all these years, but she was, until the end of
’45, at least in the same camps, perhaps in the women’s camp. And there were
opportunities where we’re interacting. I think she had the, I think, a mo— a
important kind of indirect effect.

Q: And were you the same for her?

A: I doubt it. I was younger. I was used to (you know) to— that parents take care of
you. (you know) And I was not at the stage where, say, you take care of your
parents, although when I had the opportunity, I did help. But it was more the other
way around.

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 20

Q: When you were a young boy, and I don’t know what age your mom was—

A: She was, (you know) considering that I was the youngest and there was something
like a 20-year spread, you can— you can tell that she was in her (f) late forties or
fifties. I have the dates, but I don’t remember.

Q: Do you imagine her Holocaust experience was very different, by virtue of her age
and being a mother? The difference for a young boy and a mom?

A: I haven’t looked at it or thought about it 1n those terms, but I do know that her
experiences were very difficult. And she was a hard worker, and—and knew (you
know) how to— how to try to survive. But even— But for her age, certainly, it would
have been much more— much more difficult.

Q: When you were trying to keep yourself alive, were you simultaneously always
concerned and worried about your mom too?

A: I might have been concerned, but there’s really no-no point in that. (you know) The
survival is a day-by-day thing. (you know) It’s what’s happening now, what’s
likely to happen tomorrow, that you’re concerned about, and would be perhaps
concerned also about her. But it’s the immediate. There’s no long term, no long
range kind of planning.

Q: Survival day by day, the notion of choice, is that forever shaping you as an
individual from that point on?

A: I think only in terms of risk taking, that you’ve practiced (you know) taking risks,
making these choices, whether they’re good or bad, but you had to make this— If
you didn’t, you’re not trying to survive. You had to look at what was going on, and
whether you had a choice, or put yourself in a position where you will have a
choice of—between options, and-and taking—making a choice, which always
involved risks. So perhaps the habit of risk taking is—is part of the legacy (you

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 21
know) of that experience. I mean, I can look at people in my own family, looking at
certain dangers that they look at: the food might be now 3 days old, (you know)
what— you got a problem. See, that’s not a problem to me. No, that’s not what you
worry about.

Q: You could see how it might affect you in the opposite way, that it might make one
not certain of choices. But for you, not.

A: I don’t see that.

Q: It didn’t make you doubt your instincts or your choices?

A: There’s no time. For these sort of things, there’s no time. It’s instinctive a lot of the
time, although there may be (you know) a rational basis somewheres there, but it’s
instinctive, what you do.

Q: Was friendship also a way of hanging onto humanity? Does it keep you connected
in a way that’s important? Is it also a burden?

A: I think the (you know) the relationship of a mother to her children isn’t something
you can generalize to other situation. I think that’s unique. And it-it doesn’t apply
to a father, for example, though my father was already passed away. But from my
observations. So I cannot generalize from a mother-(you know)-child relationship
to anything else.

Q: You had been taking care of your mother for quite a while before?

A: No, I wasn’t. She was taking care of me.

Q: She was.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 22

A: Yeah. She was— I mean, there was a period in the Kaiserwald concentration camp
where I had access to clothing that could be traded for food, and during that period
I could (you know) help her with some-some food. But other than that, I mean, in
the— in the Riga ghetto, she was doing laundry for the well-to-do Jews in the ghetto
for food. And she would share that with me. And in the— what makes an
impression, is when— The first day, when we were taken into the Kaiserwald
concentration camp— This is the first concentration camp, and the procedure is quite
traumatic, where you’re reduced to nothing, to a number, nothing that you own, and
you’re very much see that you’re not worth anything to anybody except for perhaps
what labor you can provide. And that first day, when we met across the double
fence, the division between the men’s and women’s camp, and she threw her
portion of bread across this-this divide for me. I-I didn’t do that. So this is the kind
of thing you can— you can expect (you know) to see from a mother. Maybe not
always. But it was on that day, I think it was critical. It said— They say I’m nothing;
well, she says I’m something. I should stay alive. And that-that makes an impact, I
think.

Q: And you’re literally being stripped of your physical and emotional identity.

A: Identities, right.

Q: Your mom did not survive.

A: No. She died in Stutthof, ’'d say about 3 months before the liberation.

Q: Had you been in touch with her? Had you been able to see her before?

A: Not in Stutthof. Only on the way to Stutthof. The men and the women were
together in the transport.

Q: When did you last see your mom, then?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 23

A: That was on the trip from Kaiserwald, from Riga, to Stutthof, by boat and then by
barges. We were together during that—those few days.

Q: How did you hear about her death?

A: Well, after the-the liberation, I first— I looked for information in this tracing bureau,
which happened to be in the town that I was working in, in Germany, for UNRRA,
and found nothing. Then when I encountered other people that I knew, women,
who did survive or knew something about the people from our transport, and what
information I got is that she perished in the typhus epidemic that took place in
Stutthof, after I was— already left. So that was my impression of (you know) how
she— how she died.

Q: Could you grieve, or by that time had even that been changed by—

A: It has. It has been changed. It isn’t— It isn’t a relationship or a sense or an emotion
that you want to rejuvenate, because it’s— I think it would be too difficult to deal
with. So it’s pushed away.

Q: Still is, Sam, or does it start to shift?

A: Well, no, it still is. The only thing that comes up if I dwell on it is the anger, the
rage at (you know) what they did to her. But there’s nothing you can do about that.

Q: Does one just tamp it, just try to keep it—

A: Yeah. Just keep it on the factual basis. Keep the emotions out of it.

Q: When one survives what you’ve survived, does it later in life make it difficult to
seek help? Does it complicate even—

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 24

A: I don’t know. I have not examined it (you know) in this— in this context. You mean,
does the experience affect you in terms of how you want to deal with its aftermath
or?

Q: Does even having survived it make it difficult to seek help, for instance for
depression? Does it seem, in the big scheme of things, something you should be
able to handle, given what you’ ve already survived?

A: I think that when there’re other ways of dealing with it, that would be the preferred
way, to me, like (you know) getting involved in your— in your work, in your family
life, and— And that was effective, of course, for a long time. It’s just after
retirement that that was not really available in the same manner. So it was very late
before I-I sought (you know) help of that kind. And you keep reading, they tell you
(you know) go-go get it. It’sit works. And I think 1t does work, which is— That
was not available really for— until (what) maybe ten years ago, that you can actually
interfere with the workings of your— of your mental system with-with a pill. So—
But it does.

Q: In what ways do you see your Holocaust experience having altered who you are,
who you were as a person?

A: I think that the Holocaust experience affects survivors, including me, in a negative
way. I mean, I don’t think that you can completely avoid its effects. And— But at—
by the same token, there’s really not much you can do about it. Just deal with it,
with (you know) the way you are and who you are. So yes, I think it affected me,
and not in the way that I would like to see, in my— how I can relate to people, or
cannot relate to people. But as I said, well, that’s water under the dam. You just
have to deal with these after-effects and do the best you can with it. And I think it’s
not that (you know) terrible. There’s other ways people can be affected, in worse
ways.

Q: Absolutely. .. .What are the negative consequences for any survivor, and yourself?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 25

A: Well, I think in-in-in free relating to people, even (you know) even to family
perhaps, that it interferes with that. Because you always, I think for me, have to
look after your emotional (you know) reactions. Because they can be (you know)
unacceptable to me. So it interferes with an open, completely open and direct kind
of relationship. Not terribly bad, but— (you know) So you’re not the life of the
party. So what?

Q: The qualities one needs to survive are probably the opposite of what one needs for
successful intimate relationships in the world. So there’s an inevitable tension.

A: Well, you always have to- In the survival process, you always have to look out for
danger, for— And that can come from anywhere. So this alertness (you know) 1s
what I think may be getting transformed into a interference with-with relationships.

Q: And a kind of guardedness, a kind of distrust or wariness?

A: And, well, on the other hand, being careful in— and testing what you’re going to say
and how you’re going to behave, not being (you know) spontaneous about it.

Q: Measured?

A: Mm-hm.

Q: Could you see those threads all throughout your life?

A: I think so, yeah.

Q: And did your best not to be led by them, but to—

A: Well, try to (you know) deal with it as best as you can, and the choice of your
friends makes a difference.

Q: Tell me how and when you met your wife, and how you married.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 26

A: Well, I was— I graduated from Columbia University in New York, and got my first
job there, and I met her at some party, some social event. And within something
like 6 months or 9 months, we were married.

Q: What were you drawn to?

A: I don’t know. It’s—It’s interesting, but obviously there was a match of-of
personalities and pers—perhaps personal needs. .. Because, I mean, I’m not— don’t
want to get into details. I don’t know I know them in detail. But I do know that
there was— it was clear to me, because at the time, I was going out with another
young woman who was a survivor. And I thought, well, we’re a match, and kind of
looks like obvious, you know, that’s the direction. And when I met Ellen, it became
obvious that it’s not; that— So just in what specific ways, I wouldn’t venture.

Q: Did you know you wanted a family and children?

A: I took it for granted that that’s what you— that’s what life after the camps was like.
(you know) Get a good job if you can, and .. build up a— build a family.

Q: Was there a rush towards normalcy?

A: Well, (you know) after all these years of exciting adventures, and you find yourself
in so-called normal life, you look around and say, “What is normal life?” And
that’s what you see. Normal life is a family, a good job, and a house, and (you
know) that’s it. May be dull, but that’s what it is—compared (you know) to the
past.

Q: Particularly when you’re young, to have survived and then step into the normal life
must have felt dull or ordinary. It’s such a shocking transition.

A: Shocking? Well—

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 27

Q: It’s a dramatic transition.

A: Dramatic. Dramatic, yet. But again, this is, I got a job where I had challenges. And
that’s where the challenges came from, the— to advance professionally, and I did,
did well, I thought. But then found out that there was one aspect that was either due
to my experiences or may not have been due (I have been there already), is that I
didn’t take well to working for somebody, (you know) to take the authority. And so
before long I was looking for ways to do it on my own.

Q: And engineering suited you? Was that a good match, given your sensibilities?

A: Really not quite, but you could— (you know) It was enough of a base to do what I
wanted to do, because in some of my activities we were outside of engineering.
They were— Some of it was in business, some of it more closely to science, but
enough of a base to-to go in those directions.

Q: Had you dreams as a young boy, before the war, of another career?

A: Of being an engineer. Yeah. And the question was, well, what kind of engineering.
There are so many varieties. And there was— Electronics was coming on, electrical,
there was other scientific— I don’t know that physics was a branch. But I looked at
something that says, what do I really know? The only thing I knew was things that I
could see around me. Those were mechanisms. (you know) So said, well, Ill take
mechanical engineering. I never worked in mechanical engineering, but that was
my-my degree.

Q: Did you tell your wife, early in your courtship, about your experiences?

A: Yes, I believe so. Sure.

Q: So she knew.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 28

A: Yeah. Well, her own background 1s allied to it.

Q: And children. You had how many’?

A: Two. Two daughters. Susan is the older one, and Linda, who just moved here from
Columbus, Ohio. She’s worked there for many years, after college.

Q: How does it play out, a Holocaust survivor and being a parent?

A: I don’t know what it is for them. You-— It couldn’t be finally positive unless you try
to make it so. For me, I think it affected my dealing with young children in a
negative way. I think I was not as emotionally relating to them as perhaps I would
have been without— or sometimes too emotional. So I think it affected that, but not,
I don’t think, in any terrible way. They made it in spite of me.

Q: For kids, in some ways your experience would trump anything that they’re going
through, whether they’re reluctant to complain or be upset about something, when
you think of what your father’s gone through.

A: Maybe. I think Susan, the older one, might actually say that. (you know) In her own
experience, when she would compare, she’d say, why could— why should she worry
about that, (you know) by comparison. But I don’t know how prevalent that is. (you
know) People have their own need to live, (you know) and their own desires and
objectives. And when you look at my experience, you say, well, that’s something of
the past. (you know) You don’t really expect anything like that to be part of your
life. So it’s interesting but not necessarily relevant, beyond the immediate
interrelationship.

Q: You said we all are whatever our past is. That is with us.

A: Yes. [overlap] [Can’t divide it], yeah.

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 29

Q: When did they express interest in knowing about your Holocaust experience?
When did you first tell them?

A: They saw it in their Sunday school experience. They were shown movies when
they were teenagers. So that’s when they might have started to ask. And to the
extent that they asked, I told them within (know) limits of (you know) what at their
age they can accept or— accept. And then of course it was in their student years,
when there was a class that was dealing with something, to survive in the forest or
something like that, and they invited me to talk to the— to the class. And there were
questions afterwards that they could also send in through Susan, because we ran out
of time. And I remember that one question that the fellow student asked says,
‘How did we deal with drugs in the concentration camp?” That gives you an idea,
the different perspective. They try to trans— to transform their background, their
problems to my background. And you can’t do it.

Q: Are you a citizen?

A: Mm-hm.

Q: Was that important to you?

A: Oh, it happened to be very important in terms of my connection to Palestine or
Israel, because I had family there. I had a brother and two sisters still there after—
immediately after the war. And because of my Zionist background, I wanted to go
to Palestine after the war—even though, through my actual connections to people I
met, especially one American officer who was doing a lot for me, who was
arranging a visa for me to come to the United States, which he did arrange. And I
said, “Well, that’s not where I want to go.” And I was making arrangements to go
with this illegal immigration to Palestine. And so the first boat that I- that my
friend Harry actually took, also helped by the same lieutenant, went, I think in
March ’°46, and I didn’t— I wasn’t going to go with that. But then we found out that
the British were holding— were stopping all the boats with illegal immigrants and

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 3 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 30
putting them in a camp in Cyprus. So the advice given to me is that you have— you
can go to the United States. Why don’t you go to the US and wait there? It’s better
than being in another camp in Cyprus. So that’s what I did a few months later, in
July of 46, that I came here. But I immediately (almost, within a month or two)
volunteered for the draft, because officially World War II was not over on the
books. So if you served in the Army, you could get a GI Bill of Rights. And so I
went into the Army, a volunteer, got basic training in field artillery, and then they
shipped me out to Korea, and they put me in the counterintelligence corps there.
And 10 months after my entering the Army, all draftees were released from service.
And that of course put me in a better status as far as citizenship. I was— I served in
the Army. I could get it [in something] like 2 or 3 years instead of 5 years. But I
had my first papers still. I was not a citizen. But I could study—

[Tape 4]

Q: So that fast-tracked you, made it easier?

A: Yeah. So in terms of (you know) why citizenship was important, be— having the GI
Bill of Rights, 10 months in the Service meant I had 2 years plus 10 months, which
was a long way for college education. But the better part of 1t was that I could study
in any accredited college. And the Institute of Technology in Haifa, Palestine, was
an accredited college. So within a year of coming here to the United States, I was in
Palestine, in Haifa, studying at the— at the Technion. And I got involved because
the war of independence started, and I served there, first in the Hagannah, then in
the Israel Defense Forces. But when that was over, I came back to the United States
to continue my studies here. And I got my citizenship soon afterwards. So I had my
education, I was a citizen, I felt very much at home here, and appreciative (you
know) of the opportunities here. I did not regret leaving Palestine and coming here.
Obviously I preferred it, because I had had a taste (you know) of life in the United
States, the people relationships. I mean, the Israelis were okay as far as I was
concerned, but they didn’t wish you a “have a nice day.” (you know). That’s not
their way. (you know) And I seemed to like the friendliness of people here. So

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 31
yeah, the-the— Serving in the Army and getting the citizenship was important to me,
and I appreciated it.

Q: Did your siblings stay in Palestine?

A: Oh yeah. They had gone there in the early thirties. So that was home for them.

Q: When you think of homeland?

A: I think here, this country.

Q: Do your wartime experiences affect the easy notion that we have here of
patriotism? Is 1t more complicated for you, the fine line between patriotism and
nationalism?

A: No, I think it’s more simple. It’s more— (you know) It’s more real to me, (you
know) patriotism here, to be patriotic here. I think it’s straightforward. (you know)
You can have things here that I didn’t see anywhere else. And so that’s it. That’s
my country—even though I was brought up on Palestine being the homeland of the
Jews.

Q: Do you think of yourself as American?

A: Oh, sure.

Q: How would you identify yourself?

A: Well, I would have to say how- to be a survivor and not to be a survivor, an
American survivor, a survivor that lives in America, to detach that from it: the
survivor angle as being (you know) what makes me American. I think it’s more
fundamental than that.

Q: Tell me what you mean.

A: Well, the opportunities, the relationship with people, even though there was quite a
bit of anti-Semitism when I first came here. But there was no really fundamentally
a purely American American. They came from someplace. And so that kind of puts
you on an equal basis for claiming your right. You may not like the way you’re
treated, but (you know) people are not perfect. Countries are not perfect. I think it
was Churchill who said that. It’s not perfect, but 1t’s the best there is, in his— in his
quotation.

Q: How would you rank Jewish, Holocaust survivor, American, husband, father, as
part of your identity?

A: Survivor and Jewish are, to me, one and the same thing. If you’re a survivor, and
you stay— you come from (you know) a Jewish background, you’re Jewish. I mean,
whether you wanted it or not, you were Jewish. And I certainly feel very much
Jewish.

Q: Was that an important part of your identity before the war?

A: It was the identity, but it was Zionist, the Zionist angle, because that was the way
out of Lithuania. Didn’t feel like Lithuania was my homeland. Jews certainly, by
and large, didn’t feel that, although there was a small subset. As a matter of fact,
my former teacher (Bronson, who was in the police), he was one of those. He had
been a captain in the Lithuanian army, which is a high rank for a Jew, and he
belonged to a group, kind of played a leadership role in the group that said Jews
can be part of Lithuanian nation, and they should work on that. And of course he
learned very quickly that that was not so.

Q: When you’re a Holocaust survivor, does it become the defining part of your life for
the rest of your life?

A: I think so.

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 33

Q: Tell me the reality of that.

A: Well, when you talk to people who did not (you know) experience it, and you
describe or think of your own experiences, it is so different, it is so unique, if you
will, that you can’t help but identifying yourself as such.

Q: Is there any part of that that, if not limiting, that one resists after a while?

A: Well, you resist by not dwelling on it with other people. But you can’t avoid it.
You-— I mean, with— To find amongst Americans people you can relate to very
easily, they’re bound to be from— (you know) also from other countries. (you
know) Recent immigrants or old immigrants or— So it does define you.

Q: Was it important for you that you marry a Jewish woman?

A: Yes, yes, it was.

Q: Always had been, and would have been before the war? Or more so after the war
and what you survived?

A: Well, it was kind of obvious. (you know) It couldn’t imagine something different.
Not-not at the time when I married, and was too close (you know) to my
experience.

Q: Was it the cultural identity of being Jewish, or were you religious?

A: No, I was not religious at all, because the— my upbringing in Kovno, the particular
Zionist party I belonged to was not religious. In fact, they were anti-religious. So I
was brought up not being religious, and that sticks with you. How you— (you know)
How you're brought up is a major influence.

Q: In the Holocaust experience, faith didn’t play much of a role?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 34

A: No. No, it didn’t play any role at all, I don’t think.

Q: Did the Holocaust experience in fact confirm your sensibilities in not believing?

A: I could easily use that (you know) as a confirmation. It’s very simple for me to say.
I look at my experience, I say: Where was God? What kind of God is it? (you
know) How can you (you know) look for that as your help? He didn’t help. So,
now, I don’t know if that’s a true assessment or not, but it’s very easy to rationalize
it that way.

Q: Have you ever been tempted by faith at any point in your life, or now?

A: No.

Q: Any of that shifting as you—

A: No.

Q: Has the experience made you less afraid of death?

A: I think (you know) death becomes real when you get to the older ages. And it’s a
reality. And the only question is, (you know) how do you deal with it? Well, one
thing is like postponing it: I’m okay today, so I’m not going to worry about, and do
what I can. If something happens, you feel (you know) some symptoms, say, “Ah,
this is it, this is coming,” then the only thing to do, of course it’s disturbing
immediately, but the only thing to focus on is how you’re going to go out. It’s very
important to go out (we call it) with some dignity, not to go through long medical
treatments, and to avoid pain but to just go to sleep. And that’s the best you can do.

Q: Have you taken care of DNRs and that of thing?

A: Oh yeah, sure.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 35

Q: I also imagine you would want a little bit of control over it.

A: Very much so. Very much so. As much control as possible, which is not necessarily
possible because of the medical profession that— and the rules of the game.

Q: Having seen what you saw and survived what you saw, how do you ever grieve and
mourn as people do after that? Did it impact the way you grieved and dealt with
other losses that came in your life? Does it change it?

A: I suspect it does, but I don’t know how it would have been otherwise. I have no
reference. I had these experiences when I was young. So how would I have been if
I did not have the experience? I can’t imagine that, except I know it would have
been different.

Q: Do your children identify themselves as Jewish?

A: Yes, they do.

Q: Proudly?

A: Well, they have their— They have their own ways. You [could] pretty much have to
ask them.

Q: Will it be important for your daughter’s children to know about your Holocaust
experience?

A: Yes. And (you know) I provided them with the tapes that have been made, and
some maybe documentation that they were interested in. So they have it. They
could (you know) convey it. And I suspect they’ Il— they do want them to know (the
children).

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 36

Q: Beyond the details of your narrative, what would you want your grandchildren to
consider, based on what you’ve gone through?

A: It’s hard for me to imagine. (I mean) I see the present (you know) generation, who
look at the experiences of survivors, and what they make of it. It’s— And I think the
next generations will have their own perspective. It’s not going to be— It cannot be
a background that makes our experiences real in any way. So all you can do, I
think, is to tell them what you know, and any hints you can give as far as how to—
how to assess its relevance to them. But it’s going to be up to them to— and their
own evolution and growing up, as to how they will deal with it and what they will
or will not get out of it. But they will know that there was something different
there.

Q: Is there relevance to this kind of testimony in our world today?

A: That’s what I am kind of concerned about. It’s— The main theme that you hear
about is (you know) prevention. Should not happen again. Well, it is happening. So
what do you do? How do— How do you prevent it in Rwanda, or in Darfur? It— You
can only try to deal with it after it’s happening. So prevention, maybe you can talk
about that in western countries, to-to prevent, but the ingredients for it happening
are in western countries also. So yes, it’s relevant in terms of prevention or
containment, but it doesn’t happen automatically by saying (you know) people
shouldn’t hate. What people? When? In what part of— What’s the— What’s the
background? So to make a— To really to make a significant influence from that
experience, I think, is-is the complex part, and that’s the part, I think, that needs to
be worked on.

Q: Being Jewish in America today, do you feel secure? Or does one never feel secure?

A: No, I feel secure. I mean, the concern here is global warming. (you know) That’s
not-not a Holocaust. And I’m old enough so that my range is not very long. So

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 37
what you can anticipate for this short range is different [what] our children have to
be concerned about.

Q: When you see something like Darfur or Srebrenica or Rwanda, how do you
respond?

A: Well, in two ways. One is that: What can one do to prevent it from actually
happening? And that means to prevent the conditions to materialize and that will
make it happen. Very little. I mean, you’d say United Nations is supposed to be
(you know) concerned, be concerned about that. But then you’re facing situations
that are happening. And there, all you can do really is to influence public opinion,
because it’s only through that mechanisms that the governments involved can do
something about it. It’s not- You can’t go there and join the army that fights the
military. It’s— It’s-it’s not a very satisfying way to try to deal with it. Prevention in
this African or Asian countries is almost impossible.

Q: Do you inevitably measure it against your own experience?

A: No. The— The usual comparison is this issue of genocide. (okay) This was
genocide, there is genocide happening. But that’s not my perspective. Mine is a
very narrow perspective. I’m one. (you know) And here you’re talking about
genocide and it’s millions. So I don’t really connect through that mechanism. But I
can connect through individual people who are subjected to it. But that’s harder to
do with people in Rwanda or in Darfur, because it’s a different background.

Q: Bosnia perhaps was a little—

A: Bosnia might be closer, yeah.

Q: Is there some part of you that’s not surprised?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 38

A: Well, the part that would not surprise me is that when I look at the ingredients that
are needed to implement (you know) a genocide or random murdering, these
ingredients are there. So that doesn’t surprise me, that it can happen. (you know) It
can happen here. But is it allowed to happen? (you know) What does it take to
prevent it? But not that it can happen. That doesn’t surprise me.

Q: In human nature, have you learned, is any of us capable of either? The capacity for
good and evil in each of us?

A: I think the-the capacity for rationalizing the evil part that one engages in 1s there.
The motivation is what’s needed, to look for this rationalization. What personal
gain, what advantage do I get out of it? What rationalizations does the government
or whoever’s— like the Aryan philosophy, that-that is (you know) is there, but just
the spread of different types of collaboration 1s so wide and so important that it
comes (you know) from a wide range of types of people in different ways to
support such a thing. That part, I know it can— it can be there. But the environment
has to be created. The mechanism has to be created. And people can be taken into
that net.

Q: It seems to me, you understand with a kind of vividness that would be particular to
what you’ve gone through, the degrees of evil and good, degrees of collaboration,
degrees of betrayal.

A: Yeah, there’s degrees of (what do you call it?) people who don’t want to get
involved, bystanders. There’s different kinds of bystanders. And they may not think
(you know) that they’re contributing to it, but they do, in different times of this
process. Yeah, it’s-it’s complex. And to say that “Look at— Look at me, I could
never become this monster,” well, you don’t need to become this monster. You can
support the process in much, much different ways, all of them necessary.

Q: Describe the first moment you felt real liberation, coming out of the hospital.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 39

A: Well, see, strictly speaking, I was liberated when I escaped. The American (you
know) troops were going by, and I was there on the side of the ditch, and then I
become unconscious. I was unconscious, so if I was being liberated, I had no idea
that that was the case. And being in the German hospital was kind of— They were
Germans, you know. Is this liberation? Of course it had very positive aspects, being
in that hospital. So it was only after I was released from the hospital, and went
outside, and it happened to be the hospital on the edge of town, and I was not going
to go into town. I wanted out, away from all this. So I went into the fields, a road
going to the next village or town, whatever it would be. And it was a spring day,
beautiful day, and you were in nature. I hadn’t been in nature for years. And I felt
(you know) free in a sense that I did not have to fear for my life. There is no-no
danger looming around the corner, because the Nazis are gone. The Germans in the
hospital maybe didn’t like my presence there, but they sure weren’t mistreating me.
In fact, a~a German nurse 1n a white coat would bring me food on a tray. (you
know) Well, that’s not concentration camp.

But another aspect of it is, aside from not being— not fearing for your life, 1s
this notion that you are alone. And that was not a threatening thing. That was the
opposite, because the experience in ghettos and in camps is that you’re never alone.
Particularly in the concentration camp, the— whether it’s the kapos or SS, are on top
of you every minute of the day and night. So not to have anybody, and not to have
to worry about it, was something that was very, very different. And that’s what I
considered to be really my experience of freedom. I didn’t know what the future
was going to bring, but I wasn’t worried about it. I was dealing with the immediate.
I was going to see what can I do in this next village.

Q: You lost all points of reference, no matter how awful they were, so it took you a
while to get accustomed to that?

A: Well, it’s again, it’s the-the importance, the overwhelming importance of the need
of the moment. I needed to get a meal. I needed to find a place where I can sleep. I
needed to know who am I dealing— Who are these Americans? (you know) What—

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 40
How do I deal with them? Can I find other survivors from the camp? So there’s no
great philosophical thoughts. There were just: deal with what you have to deal with
at the moment. And that’s what usually makes the day. It’s— you— I can
philosophize about it now, but I don’t have to worry about these things.

Q: What you did after the war (the war crimes work), how important was that for you?
Tell me what your role was.

A: Well, I think— Strictly speaking, the role, in terms of the American officer and
officers of this team who took me in, was simply to help me get along. I don’t think
they were dependent on me being (you know) an interpreter. They had two Polish
officers who were interpreters, and they had American with German backgrounds
who were interpreters. So they really weren’t critically dependent on my services.
They wanted to help me, really. And so they took me in as part of the team.

To me, of course, I would hang onto anything I heard that I can be useful. Like
they were saying whether then or later, I don’t know when, that I could de— I could
sense the difference between a German who was a Nazi and who was not a Nazi; or
that if we were interrogating a camp guard, I would know better some of the
questions to ask, because I knew what they were doing and how they were doing it.
So I felt that it was useful, it was important. And I was with them for almost 8
months, doing this.

Now, when— Their-their mission definition changed in time. I don’t know
exactly when along these 8 months, but they were told not to pursue crimes against
other people other than Americans; that they should pursue war crimes against
Americans, which basically meant war crimes against the American flyers who
parachuted down and then were killed by the local Nazis. And in that department
(you know) I couldn’t add that much, except to judge the people in the town where
this happened, or the village where this happened, as to who might have been (you
know) involved, in terms of assessing their former participation (you know) in the
Nazi governance.

Q: What was that like for you to do that, to confront Nazis who had been a part of it?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 4 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 41

A: Well, hopefully that I’m helpful in bringing them to trial.

Q: Did you deal with them? Were you furious with them?

A: No, I think the Americans were more furious than I was. To me, they were a known
quantity. (you know) They-— I had seen them before. And of course it was perhaps
satisfying to see them now in this meek (you know) position, not acting this brave,
strong (you know) men that they were not, really. So there was a satisfying aspect
to that.

[Tape 5]

Q: When you were working with the war crimes team, did you have any feelings of
revenge or anger?

A: No, no. I don’t think so. As I said, I think the— some of the Americans, especially
[Lt. Reese], was more emotional about seeing (and) what-what was done, what
happened.

Q: But you’d been living it.

A: Yeah.

Q: Why no sense of revenge?

A: Well, the sense of revenge— (you know) I’m practical. (you know) I mean, I can
have a sense of revenge, but what am I doing? I’m helping with this war crimes
team, and that’s what I can do. I’m not going to go find an SS man and try to kill
him.

Q: Do you think war crimes tribunals are important? Is there value to trying to make
people accountable for those kinds of crimes?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 42

A: Well, from the (you know) broad perspective, I don’t know. People say that it was
important. It set up standards of what can or cannot be done by governments and in
wartime. My own perspective is not quite satisfying. I mean, it’s one thing to see
the top leadership, (you know) the Nazi, and 10 or 20 of them being (you know)
hanged. That’s fine. But I was looking more for the people at the level that I had
encountered. And those were not the philosophers, the theoreticians. They were
ordinary— not ordinary, I hope, but plain people who happened to be either sadistic
or murderous, and then you go up from there to the higher levels, who were not
actually doing— They didn’t pull the trigger; they supervised those who did. I
wanted to see some of those.

The only one that I did come across (and I just actually checked it recently)
was one man in Kaiserwald, was Dr. Krepsbach who was the medical officer and
whose job was the selections. And I had a direct encounter with him. And it turns
out that he was tried before a war crimes tribunal, but not for what he did 1n-in
Kaiserwald. Before he came to Kaiserwald, he was in Mauthausen. And that was
supposedly the worst inside Germany, the camps, with a lot of medical
experiments. And he was (med) one of the medical officers there, and he was tried
and convicted and executed. So fine, he was executed, for what I— in my mind, it’s
also for what he did in Kaiserwald.

But it didn’t reach down. The war crimes tribunals didn’t reach down. Was just
too many. There were thousands of people who committed these war crimes. And it
was stopped at a certain level. They went for the higher ups, not for those who
actually committed the direct atrocities.

Q: When in our time you see something like the Milosevic trial—

A: Oh, you certainly hope, and I follow it hoping that they catch these two generals
and-and air out their activities, to show (you know) that this is being done now, in
our— in our environment. Yeah. I’m very much in favor of attempts to-to punish
more current (you know) people who commit these war crimes, as defined now by
the Nuremberg trials.

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 43

Q: Except you’re right, even there, it comes down to a few people.

A: Yeah. But that’s— It’s symbolic. (you know) It’s— Hopefully it teaches a lesson,
which I doubt that it teaches a lesson. But maybe, maybe it will. But it doesn’t. It
doesn’t stop.

Q: When you hear “forgiveness” and “mercy,” how do you respond?

A: I don’t go for that. It’s— For one thing, I’m not religious so I don’t subscribe to the
religious aspects of these kind of notions. (you know) You be-— I-I like to be helpful
and generous with people who are on the other side of this problem. No, I-I don’t
believe in forgiveness. There is very little punishment already, as it 1s.

Q: People say that without that, there’s a bitterness and anger that animates a life
forever. Does that ring true for you?

A: I’m not sure I follow that.

Q: The theory of forgiveness is that one ultimately is released from bitterness and
vengefulness.

A: May be. Maybe to some people it— I don’t think 1t would work for me. I (you
know) I try to not dwell on the-those things that cause bitterness, because there’s
not much I can do about it except voice my-my bitterness. And that’s pointless. So
I try not to go that route.

Q: Has your Holocaust experience shaped your political, social views?

A: Well, I think— I think it does. I am—I am more concerned about the welfare of
ordinary people than about the welfare of (you know) big corporations. Yeah. The
people effects is what I am concerned about, and I think it has something to do with
my background.

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 44

Q: How would you identify yourself politically?

A: I-I think I would identify myself as an independent, tending to vote with-with the
Democrats because they, more often that not, would at least proclaim the same
interests (you know) in the welfare of people, not always affecting it, but- So ’ma
Democrat with an open mind.

Q: Are you culturally conservative?

A: Like, what do you mean by that?

Q: Your view of gay marriages, or drug laws?

A: Yeah, I’m-I’m likely to be liberal in those issues.

Q: As a parent, did you pamper your children more because of your experience, or
less?

A: I think, both.

Q: Tell me about you as a dad.

A: Well, pampering them perhaps when they were young, and being perhaps
unnecessarily strict, some aspects, as they were getting older.

Q: Do you want them to be risk takers, to be unafraid?

A: I think they are.

Q: They are what?

A: They are more risk takers, more independent. Sometimes maybe too independent,
don’t listen to what we say.

Q: Anti-authoritarian.

A: Right, anti-authoritarian. Right.

Q: You were here in the sixties, the civil rights movement.

A: [overlap] And obviously very much in favor of it. But not actively participating.

Q: Surprised by it? Did have any particular meaning for you?

A: Yes, surprised that it had been going on so long, that it was accepted, (you know)
the racial divides. It did not (you know) match the rhetoric of the country as a
democracy.

Q: And identifying broad ideas of discrimination?

A: Well, obviously I’m not for discrimination of any kind.

Q: The McCarthy era, red scare?

A: Well, I think always in— wanting to see that kind of stuff (you know) stopped
immediately, drastically; that it’s was ruining people’s life unnecessarily and
wrongly.

Q: The Cold War, with your early interest in Zionism and Marxism?

A: Well, no, I had no-no positive notions about the Soviet Union then. I mean, they
were anti-Zionist also.

Q: Vietnam War?

A: Not-— I could not identify with it, except to be able to be amazed and aghast at the
kind of war it was, in terms of American soldiers, what-how-how they had to (you

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 46
know) do their jobs there, the conditions, the fire power that was involved. It’s not
like any kind of experiences that I had. It was just a different scale. And it— I was
very much— not shocked but (imp-) awed by it, that something like this (you know)
should go on, and with such casualties for no obvious purpose.

Q: And the divisions in America in the sixties, socially, culturally?

A: New. A totally new thing to me. Could only read about it and try to (you know)
understand what it is, but 1t was totally out of my perspective.

Q: Did it seem indulgent, that they were pampered kids who didn’t know about
suffering or struggle?

A: Yes, yes. Yeah. They-they seemed (you know) indulgent, especially this freedom
of relationships that seemed a waste and a distortion of what could be there, should
be there.

Q: A waste?

A: A waste in their— in their— 1n their— in their— 1n their relationships, that-that they let
that do this to themselves.

Q: Contemporary America now, your thoughts, your response to 9/11?

A: Well, clearly it was a big shock. And to try to understand or try to deal with the
potential of terrorism, it seems— it seems like it did, and it seems now like such a
powerful weapon against us, such a threat, that how to— how to deal with it is— I-I
do not know. It’s not— It doesn’t take armies. It takes something different to deal
with it. And I’m not sure that we have figured that out. But that the threat is very
real.

Q: The Iraq War, where we are now?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 47

A: Oh, I think terrible. Terrible mistakes. Unnecessary totally. Not that (you know)
there’s an easy way out of it now, but it was certainly mishandled in its origination
and basic decision, and mishandled in its execution.

Q: Your sense of the world order. Do you feel it’s precarious?

A: Yeah, I think so.

Q: Tell me where you are.

A: Well, 1f-1f you talk about global warming, (you know) and the global economy, and
the globalization of everything, how you deal with that effectively, is-is threatening
to the future.

Q: Do you vote?

A: Oh yeah, sure.

Q: Is that why?

A: Well, [no], ’'m a good citizen. I don’t know that I (you know) influence events
completely, but that’s what you can do.

Q: Why do so few of us do that in America, do you think?

A: I don’t understand that. You mean, vote? Yeah. I don’t understand that. It’s— The
lack of awareness of the importance of that is— shouldn’t be, but— And we’re not
unique. I think western countries, most of them have the same problem. It’s— I
think it’s the influence of present wellbeing. (you know) So you don’t bother. You
say, “I can’t really change things, but it’s not so bad right now, so let it be.”

Q: We take it for granted?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 48

A: Yeah, we take a lot for granted. Yeah.

Q: As a Holocaust survivor, you don’t take those things for granted?

A: No. You can’t, because the negative possibilities (you know) are kind of visible.

Q: What do you mean?

A: That things can go the wrong way. That it’s possible. And it has to be watched and
prevented. And awareness is one of them, probably key.

Q: Have you been on jury duty?

A: Once.

Q: What was that?

A: Well, it’s an interesting experience. For some strange reason, the judge appointed
me as the (what do you call it?) the chairman?

Q: Foreman.

A: Foreman, yeah. And it was a very simple case of a woman accused of drunk
driving. And she was adamant that she was not at fault, and yet the policeman
showed pretty good proof. So it was a simple decision to make, that she was guilty.

Q: Do you have faith, given your background, in a criminal justice system?

A: (Ye-) The problem is that you— the media (the newspapers, the television) tend to
publicize the negative sides of-of the just-justice system workings. (you know) The
people who are condemned to-to death and then you find that more of 100 of them
have been proven innocent, and-and the notion that there are 2 million (you know)
prisoners in prison in this country, is just staggering. It’s almost like a little country,

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 49
is in prison. And we-we have no real way of-of reversing it. It’s— But the media, I-I
think, are-are catering to people’s desire for things (you know) that are— that gets
their attention, one way or another. And bad news gets people’s attention. And I
don’t think it’s-it’s a total picture. But— It needs to be a lot better than what it 1s.

Q: Are you opposed to the death penalty, abortion, those kinds of hot-button issues?

A: Oh no. I’m not opposed to abortion, because I think it’s (you know) ridiculous to
say that a baby’s life (you know) at the very early stages, especially if the mother’s
health is involved It’s-it’s a extreme argument, a stretch to much too far. That’s
abortion.

But the penalty? I-I could be (you know) on either side of the issue if I knew
that the-there would not be so many false (you know) convictions. Plus the fact that
it’s very doubtful that it— that it prevents— (you know) it’s preventive in any way,
that it’s-1t’s reduces crime. It’s not proven. On the other hand, to spend so much
funds and money to keep obvious criminals alive through their lifetime also seems
like a kind of a unreasonable thing to be doing. So it’s not simple, not simple.

Q: Do you generally feel your experience has shaped your views on social things? It’s
not that neat?

A: Well, I think it is— it is simple in-in—on-on one level. And that is that it takes me to
be concerned about ordinary people, because that’s was my experience. I was
ordinary, and there was nothing coming from anywhere (you know) to-to be really
helpful, except possibly from the inside. So to be (you know) concerned about
more concern of the welfare of plain, ordinary people is where I think is my
experiences influenced me.

Q: Your thoughts on Affirmative Action?

A: Again it gets— 1t gets complicated. On the one hand, you look at survivors and you
say, well, we had no Affirmative Action. We (you know) had to do what we could

Tape 5 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 50
afterwards and make our own life. And so many succeeded. So it’s a— It takes
something other than just Affirmative Action. It has to— It takes internal
motivation, so— But on the other hand, some help (you know) is-is appropriate. But
I certainly would be against (you know) quotas for anyone. So again it’s-it’s— you-
you find the things are done which seem right, and then you see how they’re
executed and you say, no, that’s really didn’t do it. And that’s so prevalent in many
things.

Q: When you survived what you have, do you just laugh at people bungee jumping
and risking in physical ways?

A: I haven’t thought about that. It’s— I think bungee jumping is kind of foolish, but it’s
a thrill. Obviously it’s a thrill to these people. I-I would obviously favor more
productive risk taking than just for the fun of it.

Q: Have you looked for physical risks in your life?

A: No. [Were you a—| No. I- No. I would probably tend to take physical risks when
there is danger involved of any kind, but you don’t— (you know) in our
environment there isn’t much of that. Maybe driving on a superhighway is a
dangerous thing to do, and whether you pass somebody or not 1s a risk you take.
But those are minor things.

Q: Have you struggled with depression or melancholy most of your—

A: Not since I’m taking the medication.

Q: But had you, as you look back on it? Had that been a real force in your life?

A: I think during the more recent period (you know) of retirement. It probably was—
periodically might have appeared, but not in a continuous kind of way, as it was
more recently during retirement.

Q: In terms of personality and temperament, were you like your mother or father?

A: I don’t—didn’t really know them that well, in those terms.

Q: How would you describe your mother and father?

A: Well, the period that is most memorable is the— my teenage years, when my father
was already not well, and my mother was handling everything: the store, the— his—
taking care of him, taking care of the food, the cooking, and everything. So she was
a— She was very determined and very capable in-in handling the situation, as well
as later in the camps. She— But my father, he was— he was kind of out of it. He was
not well. He needed help. So I can’t (you know) make any comparisons.

Q: Capable and determined sounds a lot like you, too.

A: Maybe, maybe. But that— Maybe that came from my own experiences, not
necessarily from her. Or it could be, (you know) from observation.

Q: Are you today similar to that 16-year-old, surviving what you did? Are there
qualities of your personality and temperament that stayed the same?

A: I mean, the qualities of personality in that environment, the early environment, in—
(you know) during the Holocaust, that were brought out in you, are just not the
same that would be brought out in our— in our present environment. This alertness,
this intense alertness, 1s a condition (you know) of the environment I was in. I
may— (you know) I-I’m still be alert. (you know) If I see a situation that looks kind
of a little dangerous, I will (you know) try to avoid it. So in that respect it’s the
same, but not as intense. And I think that might apply to other qualities as well.

[Tape 6]

Q: What does the word “mercy” mean to you?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 52

A: Mercy. .. I guess, forgiveness .. is the association that comes to mind. Mercy.

Q: As aconcept, your thoughts on forgiveness and mercy?

A: I think we spoke about forgiveness primarily, which I was not eager (you know) to
do in my-— for people in my experience. I think understanding is-is important,
perhaps to understand why people did what they did, and how they did it. Whether
or not .. that would lead to forgiveness or mercy, I don’t know, but it would lead to
understanding.

Q: And that’s important?

A: I think so. I think it’s important in the overall context of-of “should not happen
again.”

Q: Anger?

A: Anger, very definite and particular— not so much from— Well, some of my own
experiences, early experiences, to be exposed to brutality for no reason whatsoever
brought on anger or rage. And 1n particular where— as it dealt with my mother’s
experiences and end, it brings on anger and rage. But it can’t last too long.

Q: Why?

A: Because there’s-there’s no-no practical outcome from it. (so) You can’t go with it
anywhere.

Q: Nothing you can do?

A: Yeah. You cannot really express it, except to yourself maybe, but not in any
practical way. Maybe as a relief, possibly. But no, I try not to dwell on it.

Q: Can one talk about it? Is there value in talking about it?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 53

A: .. | suspect that in general. Now, if I look at it kind of objectively, independently, I
would expect that there is value to it. Yes.

Q: To what?

A: To expressing it. To expressing anger or rage. But .. only in terms of stopping it.

Q: Doesn’t transform it though?

A: No.

Q: Betrayal?

A: Has— Would have to do with specific instances, specific people.

Q: Use a subject.

A: (Yeah.) The betrayal, you have to evaluate it in terms of specifics, not as a
generality. And again, you have to try to get into the particulars to see how it
evolved and how it might have looked from the other person’s point of view. So—
Yeah, I think it’s one of the things one encounters, I think, in this kind of
experiences, but they’re motivated by the other people’s selfishness or self needs.

Q: You talked about the Lithuanians collaborating with the SS. Were some kinds of
betrayal harder for you than others? The degrees of betrayal?

A: I don’t look at .. at the Lithuanian participation as-as betrayal. There was nothing
before that to betray. They did that out of a new opportunity to do what they— the
way they were leaning to before anyway. So betrayal, if I were to look for a
particular instance, it might have to do with my cousin from— who lived with us in
the ghetto. He and his wife (who was pregnant at the time) and his mother came
from this town where they were living, in Mar-Mari-Mariampol, and we lived

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 54
together in the ghetto. And when this collection started for the Riga transport, we
were all going down the street, looking for a place to hide. And I looked upon him
(he was older, was a graduate chemist) as he was in charge of our total family,
looking out for us. And then I looked around and they were all gone. They went
into some place, and he didn’t look for us or look after us. He was just taking care
of his-his family. And so they stayed on, and we were— we were trapped. I might
say, “Well, he betrayed us,” which, strictly speaking, he did, but only from my
perspective of what he should have done. From his own perspective, I’m sure he
wouldn’t consider this betrayal. You can’t, if you try to hide, go into a house and
then go back out looking for us. That-that would not help very much. But I-I
considered it betrayal.

Q: Did you ever talk to him about that?

A: No, hm-mm. Never had a real opportunity to talk about it. Saw him occasionally
after the war in New York, but we never addressed the subject. I just didn’t feel
very friendly towards him.

Q: Revenge?

A: Revenge is a kind of hypothetical subject, again not real. I heard people say that
their revenge with-with Hitler and the Nazis is that they survived and had families
of their own. It’s true, (you know) if you want to think that way. But again, you
think of revenge as a more active kind of action against those you (fee-) have those
feelings. So to me, it might be a momentary kind of thought or feeling, but nothing
real or practical.

Q: Does the rage and anger you felt over your mother lessen over time?

A: It lessens.

Q: And again, what does?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 55

A: Because—

Q: Again the subject.

A: [overlap] This feeling of-of revenge in connection with my mother’s experience is,
it’s more— it’s more an anger, and a thought of revenge as trying to do something
about it, which of course you can’t. So it-it lessens in time, just by repetitive
occurrences and the conclusion that really it’s a pointless thing. But it lasts less and
less. It may come back momentarily, specially as I read about .. the— what might
have happened to her in Stutthof. It may not have been the typhus. And all these
other possibilities are worse, not-not better. So the notion that she might have been
exposed to any one of those situations makes one very angry and bitter, but revenge
is not a practical, (you know) rational thing to follow from that.

Q: Choice?

A: Choice. Now, that’s too broad. “Choice” is too broad a concept (you know) to
address. It’s-it’s part of life. We do all— Everybody does that every day, make
choices. So I don’t know what would make it unique in my experience, except that
the-the outcome of choices is more serious perhaps.

Q: And the absence of having any choice?

A: Now, that-that is a very definite aspect, unique to the (you know) the experience,
especially in-in the camps. Not so much in the ghetto. .. But in the camps, it’s the
lack of choice in the sense really of the absence of control of what-what’s
happening to you. And it’s more the absence of control that is the-the influence on
one’s evolution, than the absence of choice that’s— There’re many choices, but you
couldn’t control .. the-the— how many you have, or which ones you can or cannot
choose in a practical sense.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 56

Q: But in terms of the influence of one’s evolution, the absence of choice is more
important?

A: Very important.

Q: Tell me a little more.

A: Why it’s more important?

Q: And how it was for you. What do you mean by that?

A: Well, I remember it in terms, for example, of the change after liberation. I think I
mentioned my trip with [Isidore Reese, Lt. Reese], back to Germany in more recent
years. And when he recalled how—what I was like after (you know) we came
together, and he described (you know) the things that he actually did to-to help me
get over the-the past, one of them was getting me a dog, which is easy enough to
understand because the absence of trusting relationships was as a dominant thing.
And with a dog, you learn that there can be a trusting relationship, you can be free.
But the other thing that he said he did is, he taught me how to drive. And that, to
me, has to do with getting away from the notion of the absence of control. And I
can sympathize with teenagers who want to get into that car and make it do what
they want. They have control. And that’s what I think he did for me. I learned I
could take that j1p-jeep and make it go fast or slow, left or right, and that is a form
of control, which he thought helped me get over the transition.

Q: Smart man.

A: Amazingly, because he’s a— he’s— He was a smart man in that sense, because he
was trained as a lawyer, and lawyers are not taught how to handle with Holocaust
survivors. .. But he figured out that something wasn’t right, the way I was relating
(to) initially to the group, that I was— As he described it, I was friendly but kind of

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 57
distant and un-uncommunicative. And that’s what he did in order to try to change
it. And I’m sure he did change it.

Q: How are your siblings like or different from you?

A: Well, my siblings are different in one very important respect. They’re much older. I
was the youngest. And the three siblings that were alive after the war are all
between 15 and 20 years older. So that’s not a normal kind of sibling relationship.
They were more or less taking care of me, rather than relating to me as-as a brother.
And that’s the, I think, the main characteristic of our relationship.

Q: Are you alike politically? Do they share your views?

A: I don’t know that we ever dealt with it. They were in Palestine. [My] main concern
was the local situation. Before that, my brother is the one who went first to
Palestine and then brought over my two sisters. And presumably, I and my parents
were supposed to be next, but that did not happen. So that was— that was the main
(you know) relationship.

My brother, who was the oldest, was a big kind of doer in this Zionist
organization that I belonged to, which is no doubt why I followed him in the same
group. And so he was kind of a role model to me. I looked up to him. He also
served in the Lithuanian army as an officer [in] training. And so when he would
come home in his military uniform, with his white belt, I mean, this was not just
my brother; this was somebody to look up to. So that was the key (you know) to
our relationship.

Q: Did he feel guilty he couldn’t protect you?

A: [overlap] He felt guilty (at least he expressed it) insofar as when I came to
Palestine, and immediately almost after that, this war of independence flared up,
and that I ended up in-in the army there, in the informal army (Hagannah) first and
then— and again exposed to high risks, because the war of independence was very

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 58
costly in terms of the number of lives of the Jewish population. And certainly being
in the army increased that risk. And he felt kind of guilty, although he did not bring
me back to Palestine. I arranged that on my own. But that I would be in that
situation after the Holocaust experience, he felt at least bad about it, if not guilty.

Q: Did you talk to your siblings about what happened to you?

A: I don’t recall any detailed discussions of-of details. It was— I don’t think so. There
might have— The Lt. Reese, after-after the war, after he came back to the United
States, he made some trips to-to Israel and became very friendly with— especially
with my brother. And I expect that they got the information from him. But I don’t
recall discussions to convey (you know) details of my experience.

Q: Neither your inclination nor theirs?

A: .. (excuse me) Actually, in Israel, the Holocaust survivors were not looked up upon.
They were, in fact, looked down on because they didn’t fight. “Here, we Israelis,
we fight. And they just went (you know) to their deaths.” So they were— It was not
an environment, much like here actually after the war, where histories of survival
were not popular, not well received. So I think that contributed also.

Q: Another reason to be silent, then.

A: Yes, right. To be silent, yeah.

Q: Do you feel anti-Semitism today?

A: I personally don’t feel it.

Q: Feel what?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 59

A: Anti-Semitism. I don’t— I don’t feel it. Not the nec— in a way that would bother me
personally. I can read about it and feel (you know) upset about it, but I don’t feel it
as a personal risk to me, of any significance.

Q: Do you feel resentment in some larger sense still exists?

A: Resentment against what?

Q: Against the Jewish people, or against Jews in general.

A: In-in the world?

Q: In the US and in the world.

A: Well, I think makes a difference. The-there is a difference in the US and in Europe,
European countries.

Q: Well, about the US?

A: [overlap] I think it’s much more widespread in European countries, maybe in part
because of the large Muslim populations there. But it pervades into the
governments and the population as a whole. Here in this country, it’s more
localized, and you can kind of say that it’s less-less pertinent.

Q: So you’ve felt that change over your time in America?

A: Oh yes, yes. Well, whether in terms of what job you could get, or what house you
could rent. There was definite instances where it’s clear.

Q: How do you respond to Germany’?

A: I try to be selective, and not to be just generalizing [on] Germany. I had a lot of
dealings with Germans. Professionally, I happened to be involved in programs with

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 60
German companies, and in business later on. So I had no trouble working in
Germany, but selective in terms of the individuals, basically their age, and (you
know) how old were they during the time, and what were they doing. So— And
there all kinds, in that— in that sense. So anyway, I-I feel not to be broadly kind of
generalizing.

Q: When and why did you go back to Kovno?

A: I went back to Kovno with Ellen and Susan in 2001.

Q: That would be your wife and daughter?

A: Right. Susan, my daughter, and Ellen, my wife. We went— Well, Susan wanted to
visit Kovno because-because of my experience there. But we went in part, well,
because by then, I had already been waiting for— working for a couple of years at
the museum, and reading up a lot of stuff, and the experience became more-more
part of me. And they had a meeting. They called it a gathering (you know) of
Lithuanian Jews. And so I felt that I would be going there and be amongst Jews,
which 1s better than just going to Lithuania. And at the same time, Ellen was
invited to come to a reunion of this—the-the school she attended while still in
Germany. They made an effort to identify former students and invited them for a
reunion. So we went to Kovno, Lithuania, other cities there first; then on the way
back, we— Or was it first— no. On the way back, we went to Ellen’s reunion in
Germany. And that’s when 9/11 happened. So we were delayed somewhat in
coming back to the United States, but that was a-a-a noticeable year in terms of— Of
course the 9/11 kind of tended to overshadow our personal experiences.

Q: Where were you and what happened when you found out about 9/11?

A: Well, we were just maybe two days before our scheduled flight back from— This is
Kaiserslautern in Germany. The school was a religious school who treated the
Jewish pupils quite well, actually. .. And we were just going to visit at a town in

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 61
which Ellen had lived earlier, before Kaiserslautern, which was in Wurms,
Germany. And on a train coming back, we saw— we heard a-a few Americans
sitting a few seats ahead of us, talking in English about this strange thing that
happened in-in New York, New York City. And when we took a cab back to our
hotel, or the school where we were— where Ellen was at this reunion, the cab driver
was-was telling us, “You’re not going back to-to the United States very-very soon.”
And of course that led one thing to another. The local German population went out
in great demonstration in support of Americans, and it took over the-the
atmosphere.

Q: Was it odd to be in Germany, with people taking to the streets?

A: No, this was a different—different types of Germans.

Q: What was that for you?

A: To Kovno?

Q: Yes.

A: The ghetto, looking at the former ghetto, was unreal. Couldn’t see it the same as
what it was. I mean, some of the houses, the square in the middle of the ghetto were
all there, but they were just not-not there. On the other hand, (you know) the house
where we lived, the little wooden structure, was still there. And it brought back
(you know) recollections but not-not tangible, not really. (you know) It’s like, (1t)
there is a connection to it, but it’s not-not— emotionally it was not connected. But it
was interesting to meet some of the local people. There were resources that they
had in terms of recalling the history and what they were doing, and the community,
the Jewish community is there, not very large. So— But it didn’t have any
significance, (you know) emotional effects.

Q: Did that surprise you?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 6 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 62

A: In a sense, yes, because the prospect of such emotional effects is what kept me
away from there for 50-60 years. And was okay, it’s not— It didn’t have these
negative— any major negative effects.

Q: What do you make of that?

A: It’s the same as any other attempts to connect to the past. You connect at some
level but it’s not the real— not a real level. It did not have these negative emotional
effects that I can have from other contacts with the past. Somehow it was— It was
neutral in that respect. Interesting, but neutral.

Q: And the others that you can have? You described them as sometimes unrelated. An
example of what that might be?

A: It’s the emotions of— The most common, I would say, emotion, negative emotion, is
the anxiety that something bad is about to happen. You don’t know what it is, but
you sure are concerned about it. And that could come about when you think about
the immediate life and situations you might be in, say, “Oh, I’m worried.
Something (you know) may go wrong.” But it gets exaggerated because of these-
this emotions of fear, anxiety, of things you cannot control and might lead to-to bad
situations.

Q: And it can be when you least expect it sometimes?

A: I don’t know if there’s any-any particular driving force there. It’s—It depends on-on
your mood, on— If you’re in this slightly depressed mood, you’re likely to have that
more.

[Tape 7]

Q: You spoke about blocking out some of the memories, but that wasn’t to say that the
emotional wounds weren’t still there. That’s connected to that anxiety?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 63

A: Yes. That—It’s connected. These emotional moods (you know) are connected to
these anxieties. Yeah.

Q: Do sights and sounds trigger memories?

A: Not particularly. (not) Nothing special (you know) about sounds or— I think maybe
hearing Lithuanian in Lithuania might make some connection. No, but nothing in
particular. And don’t know where it could come from.

Q: You've literally repressed a whole—

A: I repressed a great deal, I think. Yeah. .. I- As I said, I suspect that many of the
things that I now might describe as my experience came from reading about it and
deciding, yes, that was my experience. But I had most likely, before that, repressed
it.

Q: Does it trouble you that you’re not sure it’s your memory?

A: Well, after a while it’s no longer (you know) from— It is— It is my own memory.
And some aspects of it are indeed. (you know) It brings back some aspects that are
real, from reading about it from other sources, or hearing.

Q: When you started the translations, you described dreams and nightmares. What
were those?

A: Well, they were either rather disturbing or .. nightmares in the sense that they woke
you up. But mostly it would be very disturbing. So you wake up in the morning not
feeling very-very happy. .. But they would— They would be those kind of dreams
that bring out these emotions of helplessness, of something bad (you know) is
about to happen and you cannot do very much about it. So you wake up. That’s the
one solution.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 64
What would be kind of a persistent— (I think at the time, not so much now) the
kind of dream that would be disturbing is that you’re going someplace, you are
someplace, you’re trying to get home, and you just cannot find your way home, or
back. That seemed to be a frequent kind of thing.

Q: [describes Miri’s father’s nightmares]

A: Well, I’m not surprised (you know) that it’s a common-common thing. It comes
from the same sources, either your own experiences, or fearing those experiences.
And like he didn’t have to be in a concentration camp to be afraid that he would be.
Obviously that was in his— in his environment. So I-I’m not surprised that it’s
common.

Q: Did you live in a constant state of fear?

A: Depends, depends what situation you’re in. And again it’s this business of being
diverted; that you had to deal with problems of the moment. But if you’re on a
work party, and it’s a bad work party, it is how to avoid the guard, and how not to
work any harder than you need to. You paid attention to that. The fact that the
guard could (you know) shoot you at any moment is a— it was a real possibility, but
that’s not what you worried about. The-the details of the situation is really what
preoccupies you. And there isn’t much time to sit there and contemplate (you
know) what things might— you might encounter. You had— The situation was there
all the time, practically. And if it wasn’t, then you used that as a reprieve, as a time
to relax, if you could. No, not relax, but rest.

Q: And concentrating in that way continued throughout your life, really, till
retirement.

A: [overlap] Pretty much, yes. Pretty much, yes.

Q: It worked well until—

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 65

A: Mm-hm. Right.

Q: Was retirement significant in all sorts of ways?

A: [overlap] Of course it is. It’s significant and fundamental ways.

Q: Tell me, and use the subject.

A: Retirement is and can be significant, as I said, in fundamental ways. This business
of what you do with yourself changes completely. You have to find other ways to-
to replace your preoccupations with your professional life, your economic life, and
you have to find something that will-will keep your attention, will-will use you in
some way. So that is a fundamental change, because if you don’t have it, then
you're not distracted.

But for me it was the opposite side of this, that I got involved in the museum,
and it gave me a new preoccupation but it was not always the— It was not
distracting from the past. It was bringing the past back. So adjusting to that, and to
reconcile these two things, was the-the important aspect of-of my adjustment to
retirement.

Q: Are you still in the process of that?

A: Well, it depends on what I’m doing there.

Q: Why is so much of the survivor experience generally framed in terms of the
narrative experiences, the story told?

A: Well, it’s framed in terms of the— The narrative is framed in terms of the
experiences because it 1s presumed that that’s what people will listen to, that they
want to hear it. It’s-1t’s like what makes newspaper material readable or not. The
routine isn’t-isn’t of that much interest, but now if you hear something unusual, and
you get an insight into how you might prob-perhaps survive, people like to learn a

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 66
lesson, and if you don’t do it explicitly, then you look for it (you know) indirectly.
And the notion at least initially after— in the seventies, when this recollection
started to come to the foreground, was that it was important to describe the
Holocaust in its details, in its detail horrors. So that’s is my perception of why it
came about that way. And survivors, I think, like to tell their stories, and display
their own (if you will) courage or whatever it took to do. It may— It’s always (you
know) looked in a positive way, the survivor story. .. So 1t-1t was— It was selling.
And it still does. I mean, look at the number of memoirs that come out. (you know)
Practically every week there’s one or two new ones. Now that we’re in the— in the
writing phase of it, because I guess publishing has become so much easier.

Q: There is an appetite.

A: There seems to be, yeah, at least (you know) right now. But it may be changing. It
may be changing. It may be reduce-reducing interest.

Q: Having too many, you mean?

A: Maybe, yeah.

Q: Do you give much thought to what you want young people to know about the
Holocaust?

A: Well, I think it’s— Two things. As a minimum, to know what it is. To know these
narratives and to know some of the broader perspectives that some historians are-
are bringing out. But what I would like them to know (and I don’t know how likely
that is, or how easy it is) is to try to understand it. That is much more difficult, to
understand it from their own perspective, which is even more difficult. I mean, it’s
simpler to look at 1t and say, “Oh yeah, there was Hitler, the Nazis. But this-this is
not around now-nowadays. It’s not’— But it’s not that simple.

Q: Not to distance themselves?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 67

A: Mm-hm. On the other hand, you don’t want them to (you know) look at it and say—
and worry about (you know) where-where-what’s in the future for them, in those
terms.

Q: Are your own memories distant? Have they become more distant over the years?

A: No, they’ve not become more distant, but as I said before, my memories have
become defined through telling them. So it’s what I’ve been telling, is what— [is]
become more-more defined. And there’s a danger 1n that.

Q: And the danger is?

A: The danger is that it’s not-not truly (you know) your memories, and perhaps not the
important ones.

Q: In the telling your story over and over to people, is it inevitable that the emotion
would become detached from the memories?

A: I think so. I think it definitely would.

Q: What would?

A: It-the— It would become detached. The emotion would become detached by
retelling. Because as I said, it’s no longer the experience; it’s the story of the
experience, and the emotions are not that close in-in that case. They become
detached also.

Q: That may be why it stays in the storytelling form for all of us.

A: Yeah, right.

Q: What memories of yours are still the most vivid?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 68

A: You mean, from the— from the camp experience? What memories? [ Yeah. ]

It changes. If I come across something, however (you know) that happens, and
I try to go back to the experience, I focus on that experience and it becomes more-
more current, more vivid. But it’s not necessarily going to stay. I may (you know)
next week run into something else and another memory would-would come up.

Q: When you were liberated, one survivor talked about having to relearn a code of
conduct. Was that true for you?

A: No, not so much in those terms, because when all is said and done, there 1s a moral
compass in camps also. Some people diverge from it more, some less. But to me,
that was not the issue. It’s how to integrate in this world that is totally foreign to
me. I mean, just to integrate, how to live amongst American soldiers. They could
look like very strange creatures (you know) to me. Their English was not my
English, and so my English had to change, whatever there was of it. Relating to
them, their— so naturally, at least the ones I associated with, so naturally fle-
friendly and wanting to be helpful. So that encouraged my own (you know)
appreciation of friendly interactions between people. I thought that was— that was
it. That was a good thing. And I think we might have conveyed something like that
to our daughters, although Ellen probably had a lot more to do with it. But on one
early birthday, they—the two-— the girls gave me a poster of Charlie Brown where he
says, “Aren’t you glad you smile?” And one of them (I don’t know if it was Linda
or Susan) wrote underneath, said, “Don’t you wish everybody did?” So that aspect
of personal interrelationships on a genuine friendly basis became, I think, part of
my— and maybe not always in a positive sense, in the sense of wanting to please
more than is necessary or desirable. But 1t was an important aspect of personal
interrelationships.

Q: I imagine you had to be extraordinarily adaptable and reactive.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 69

A: Yes, yes. You had to be adaptive. I-I think I mentioned in one of the talks my
experience with this-this SS man in Kaiserwald who was in charge of the clothing
warehouse. And that— he was— He was feared in the camp. [wait for noise] (Okay?)

So this SS man, his name was [Fischer], Oberscharfuhrer Fischer, master

sergeant, he was in charge of the kleide— Kleiderkammer, the clothing warehouse.
And to be part of that work group was very desirable because you had access to-to
clothing. And I had worked in-in the Riga ghetto in the air force clothing
warehouse, where I learned a few things, how to handle and warehouse and sort
and whatnot the clothing. So I thought I had some qualification. And the-the man,
the Jewish man who was in charge of this work group when I got into— got into
Kaiserwald, his name was Max, he one day— And people didn’t want to work in
this workforce because that was Fischer. You stay away from him. So he asked me
if I wanted to come to his workforce. And I said yes. That was a choice I made,
because it was a good— had very positive aspects to it. But how do you deal with an
SS man like Oberscharfuhrer Fischer? So I figured, Max has been dealing with
him; I’1l watch him and see what he does. And I noticed that what he was doing,
that whenever Fischer addressed him in any way, or told him anything to do, or
what have you, he would snap to attention, click his heels (you know) and respond
loudly, “Ja wohl, Herr Oberscharfuthrer.” So I says, “Well, that’s what you have to
do. Maybe I can do it.” And of course my clicking of heels and “Ja wohl, Herr
Oberscharfthrer” didn’t sound as-as good as his, but I did it. And before long, I
found myself in charge of that work group, not by my choice but by Fischer’s
choice. And so that’s-that’s (you know) what you have to do. When you don’t
know- there’s no rules, (you know) no standards of how to behave, you try to
figure it out.

Q: It’s also an example of choice. On the surface, that would seem not an obvious
choice.

A: Well, it was definitely a choice because the choice was, you say “Yes, Ill go with
you,” or you say “No, I don’t want— I don’t want this guy.” But the alternatives

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 70
were not good. The other work parties were nothing to (you know) to desire. So
this was a reasonable choice, a choice of two bad alternatives.

Q: And a good choice that maybe not others would necessarily have made.

A: [overlap] Maybe not. Maybe not.

Q: How did being young impact your survival?

A: Oh, I think it makes a tremendous difference.

Q: What does?

A: I think youth and survival are very, very much linked in terms of the nature of the
survival process. I think in particular at my age, the late teens (16, 17, 18) 1s
already a-a phase of life where you’re looking outside of your immediate family
and-and teenage friends environment. You’re getting exposed to the world. And
you try to figure out how to integrate into that world and go away (you know) from
your family confined environment. So even though the environment you’ re trying
to adjust to was not all that great, but to try to get adjusted to it is, I think, a normal
part of that stage of growing up. So in that respect, age in this interval has a— it was
very important. If you’re much younger than that, you’re what you would call now
child survivors. And they survived because somebody hid them. Somebody (you
know) protected them. They— Not they could do really on their own. If they’re
much older than that, then they’re already (you know) set in their ways, and they’re
more affected by suddenly finding this tremendous change from what they were
before to what they’re exposed to now. So I think age is very important.

Q: And more resilience at adolescence?

A: I think so. I think so, by and large. I mean, depends on your— how you grew up
before and what you were— what you learned in your earlier life.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 71
Q: Even in the midst of that horror, were people who they were when [it] began? Did
you survive that experience pretty much based on what had already been formed?
A: I don’t know how I- (you know) what in particular, how— (you know) what
influenced my survival. It’s a lot of things.
Q: We talked about your mom and
A: Yes, yes. She-she influenced (you know) my vision of myself as being— that it-it
would be good to survive, it’s important to survive. It’s not just my own desire to
live, but that 1t was important to somebody that I should— I should live. So yeah, in
that respect, it influenced it.

My activities in the Zionist movement may have influenced it because I was
active in it. When the Soviets took over the Baltic countries in 1940, we went
underground, although there was really no good reason for it. We were in favor of
the Soviet Union. It’s just, they didn’t like Zionism. So we were underground and
we had to act in a kind of organized manner. It might have— This might have
helped.

Q: You described yourselves in that period (before the war) as idealistic young people.

A: Yeah. We were, yes, idealistic young people. The idealism of course was— had to
do with Zionism, with getting out of Lithuania and go build a new life, a new
country. It certainly took idealism to believe that you could do that. And people
were doing it. Young people were doing it. They were moving there, establishing
the collective settlements, and they were doing it. So it was idealism grounded in
some reality. But you had to be idealistic about it, not-not practical.

Q: How would you have described yourself in the camps?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 72

A: How would I describe myself? I don’t know. There was just, it’s— Alert .. and-and
working on-on survival of the moment, which 1s really the key. It’s the only way
you can survive.

Q: Certainly sounded resourceful too.

A: I think you had to be, yes.

Q: How old are you now?

A: Eighty-two.

Q: At 82, at this point in your life, are there things that you’re remembering now more
than others, things that continue to shift for you?

A: I think it has a lot to do with my activities at the museum, that as I encounter
material that is— relates to my experience, I— it brings them up and I remember
them, kind of dredge them up from somewheres there, deep into memory, which I
thought has gone away. But it has to do with the signals I’m getting. I wouldn’t do
it just because I’m older.

Q: But you’ve placed yourself in that situation too.

A: Yeah, yeah, I did. One thing led to another.

Q: And you see value in it?

A: Yes, I do.

Q: Tell me.

A: I see value, not only— Of course maybe that’s self-serving, but in that the value is—
It gives me activity that utilizes something that I have, like being able to use

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 7 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 73
Yiddish and Hebrew and my background to support some of the activities at the
museum. I think that has a lot to do with it. But then I also say, well, what I’m
doing is important 1n a bigger sense: the purposes of the museum and what have
you. And that (you know) may or may not be (you know) very important, but I do
try to bring that in.

[Tape 8]

Q: Have you been through the museum?

A: Yes. .. I’ve been through the museum in most of its exhibitions, certainly the
permanent exhibition, and some of the others.

Q: How 1s that for you? Do you remember the first time you did that?

A: Well, I can’t say that it had a great emotional impact in terms of my personal
experience. I found it well done and bringing out important things about the
Holocaust experience. But not that it upset me personally in-in a great way.

Q: I ask because one of the survivors in the Life After the Holocaust program is very
involved but hasn’t been through the museum yet.

A: Yeah. Well, people will always differ in terms of their reaction to things, their past
or present. It’s— Again, it’s not something— there’s— I know people who will not go
there. But not necessarily survivors.

Q: Do you remember when you first saw a Holocaust newsreel or movie?

A: I thought that I saw things that I had not seen in my own personal experience, in all
these piles of-of dead bodies. I’ve seen enough, I have carried enough of them, but
not on the scale that you see in these documentaries.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 74

Q: Beyond those details, the general sense of it?

A: I didn’t know the Holocaust before seeing these things, on the scale that the
Holocaust is. I knew it on my very limited (you know) narrow perspective, which
included some of the ingredients of what you see in the— in the broader description,
but I certainly did not know it on that scale, until I saw the material.

Q: And your reaction to that?

A: Nothing— I mean— How should I say? Interesting and illuminating, unbelievable.

Q: So you were in it but had no idea.

A: Of the scale and the large scale of it. Yeah. I mean, we knew for example already in
late 1941, maybe 5 or 6 months after the Nazis captured Lithuania, that there is
extermination going on. We knew that the people they were selecting out and
sending— taking over to the Ninth Fort were being shot and killed and buried in
these ditches. But— And when all is said and done, we knew the scale of it in
Lithuania. We knew that by the end of ’41, more-more than 80% of the Jews were
already dead. But I didn’t know the scale of it (you know) globally, worldwide, in
Eastern Europe, and the industrial mechanization of the process, and how it
eventually (you know) displayed itself in-in the ghettos, in the camps. I didn’t
know all that.

Q: If you had known, do you think it would have impacted your survival?

A: No, I think it doesn’t. You still deal with your immediate environment, immediate
things going on around you.

Q: Did you have any “survivor guilt’?

A: No, I don’t. And I sometimes (you know) wonder about that. Why don’t I have it?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 75

Q: Have what?

A: The survivor guilt. Why don’t I have it? I don’t have it. Could I have done
something more that would have helped my mother survive? I don’t think so.

Q: Maybe there are more survivors who don’t have it, actually.

A: Maybe, although what you tend to read about is descriptions of survivors having
guilt, as though this was some-some kind of accepted and required after-effect. But
I don’t think it’s that necessarily all— all-inclusive, that prevalent. I’m sure, yeah,
there are many. But maybe that has to do more with somewhat older people who
lost their immediate families, their children, their wives, their husbands, that—that it
could be more amongst them. But not-not necessarily— Not in my survival age.

Q: Do we idealize Holocaust survivors?

A: No, I don’t idealize Holocaust survivors.

Q: I mean, the general public.

A: I don’t know that they’re idealized. .. Well, as I mentioned, in Israel they certainly
were not idealized. I don’t know if they’re idealized now in Israel. But I don’t think
you really mean idealized. I think they’re— In a sense, they’re looked upon as
strange creatures. (you know) How-— (you know) How could you get out of this
(you know) like that? But it’s not idealizing. It’s— And it’s not necessarily
admiring. It’s-it’s interesting. It’s very interesting.

Q: I think you’re right. You see the museum volunteer at the museum, and people
surround the table to hear the narrative, there’s something in that.

A: Something in-in their—

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 76

Q: In what we’re talking about, the interest or the—

A: Oh, in the people. [ Yeah] Yeah. [overlap] There is something there. Of course I
cannot see it from their perspective, being on the other end of this. But yeah, there
is, amongst many people, not-not necessarily all.

Q: Have you read any of the Holocaust memoirs?

A: Some. I’ve read some of them, yeah, from (you know) people that are describing
some of my background, or people— Mostly from people who describe my
background, my experience, type of experience, or locations or— just to learn what
did they see and remember that I don’t. And I learn a lot from that, which is what
makes me concerned about my memories. But no, it’s just an overwhelming
number of memoirs that-that are appearing, have been appearing. There’re
hundreds of them.

Q: Are there any that you think got it right in some important way?

A: Yeah. Yes, there are some that are more relevant to me, seem more real to me, and
more-— and better in describing some aspects of the experience than some others.
Some others are not that— People are not always good writers.

Q: How would you describe yourself now?

A: [laugh] Well, not-not passionate. I [don’t] think you get passionate about ideals at
my age. It’s— There’s a different kind of survival involved at this age. And you
have to pay attention to that too. But Zionist, no. I’m not— I’m a Zionist in a sense
of a great supporter of the state of Israel. I think it’s terribly important to the Jewish
people overall. And— But that’s not necessarily Zionism anymore. Zionism means
to go there. And I’m for the existence of the state and its-its strengths. And it has its
negative things too.

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 77

Q: In terms of your personality, beyond that, how would you describe yourself now?

A: In terms of my personality? I-I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m-— [overlap]
Necessarily, I have slowed down a lot.

Q: Still a risk taker?

A: But there’s not much need for taking risks. We’re comfortable. (you know) We’re
not in imminent danger. The risk only comes when you go to see the doctor and
say, “What is he going to tell me now?” (Yeah.)

Q: Optimistic?

A: Always. Always have been. And I need optimism. I react badly to negative
attitudes. That-that I know.

Q: Tell me more about that.

A: Well, people who are negative in terms of their outlook, and speak that way, have a
negative influence on me. I become— (you know) I just react to it. I don’t want
negativism. And I respond positively to positive attitudes. My mood 1s better.

Q: What’s ahead. Are there things you’d like to accomplish now?

A: No, it’s just day to day. Enjoy the things I can enjoy, which are limited. And try to
do something productive with myself to the extent that I can, because without that,
(you know) there’s not much point in going on.

Q: Are your siblings still alive?

A: No. No, they’re all passed away.

Q: When did that happen?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 78

A: Well, the first one that passed away, he died when I was born, so I never knew him.

Q: Say brother or sister.

A: That was— (Trying to get his name ...) And then the second sibling was two years
older than I was. His name was Baruch or Bokhe. And of course with him I had a
closer relationship. And he died when he was 12, I was 10, from diphtheria. Then
my sister Sarah in Israel was a nurse. She died in childbirth. My brother David died
from heart— a heart attack. I think he was on a business trip in Korea. And then my
sister, who moved here, her son moved her here, and she was in a— in a home. She
died a few years ago, just, I guess, older age. So they’re all gone.

Q: So you’re the last of the family?

A: Mm-hn, right. I’m the last of the family, yeah. But I have my own family.

Q: Is Lt. Reese still alive?

A: (excuse me) No. Lt. Reese died a day before I gave this first person talk in 2004.
And I was supposed to travel to Miami, where he was in a hospital, after the talk.
When I called, I found out he already passed away. He was 95.

Q: How do these losses impact you?

A: Well, it makes you very well aware of your age. And you try to keep whatever
friendships you still have—which are also changing. Friendships are changing.
People have their own problems and needs.

Q: You mean, harder to find time, or what do you mean?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 79

A: Well, it’s— Some, for example, might get more involved with their immediate
family, their children, grandchildren, and it can be time-consuming. And when
there’s no family relationships, it’s just person to person, it becomes different.

Q: We mentioned the DNR. Is that something you’ve discussed with your children?

A: Oh, sure. [ Yeah.| Yes. We discussed DNRs and our wishes. Our daughter in
particular, Susan, 1s very aware of needing to know what our preferences are.

Q: Because she wants to get it right, or because—

A: She wants to get it right. (Yeah.0

Q: Are you afraid of death?

A: No, no. I’m not afraid, but I would be more concerned about the process than the
end result.

Q: Not suffer?

A: Not to— Yeah, that’s right. Not to just suffer just because (you know) we have to
continue on, no matter what. That’s-that’s not what I believe.

Q: You said you’re not religious. Do you have any sense of an afterlife?

A: No. No, I don’t think there 1s an afterlife. I-I have changed perhaps slightly in one
respect, and mostly because Ellen 1s so interested in the subject. She-she believes
that there is something, that the world is just too complicated for there to be (you
know) nothing. So all that pretty much goes to agnosticism. And I might lean in
this direction, say “I don’t know,” which I don’t. But is there an afterlife? I don’t
think so. It’s not— It’s hard to imagine.

Q: Do you think that what you’re doing at the museum might make a difference?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 80

A: I can only hope so. They’re working like they want it to make a difference. So I
hope they succeed. Whether— (you know) how much— What kind of a contribution
my contribution will have to it, I don’t know. I can only use the opportunities that
come my way. And they either will or will not. I think some of it will be
meaningful on a small scale. It’s not going to prevent (you know) a holocaust, just
because of what I’m doing.

Q: What do you think people misunderstand still about the Holocaust?

A: I don’t know that I know enough about people (you know) to say what they
understand or don’t understand. It just a-a crude judgment. It would be that they
need to understand more how a holocaust comes about; that it 1s not a simple (you
know) event powered by some top people and implemented by the lower people;
that it’s a process that takes in a broad range of people. And-and it needs to be
understood in this fashion so that this broad range of people can be addressed and
made to understand that they’re important in this process. It’s not just the person
that you want to put in jail and that then you’ve secured everything. That’s not so.

Q: As the Holocaust survivors age and die, is there a danger that without the power of
the personal testimony—

A: Well, it takes both the testimonies and it takes people wanting to see it. Both are
needed. The testimonies are being (you know) materialized. They’re there. But
what do you do to make people want to-to look at it and learn something from it? I
don’t know what you need to do to do that. Maybe you have to scare them, to show
them what the Holocaust was, how bad it was, and then they’ll get interested. You
have to— I think the teaching, the training of younger people, that’s, I think, is
crucial because that’s where it all starts. So I think that’s where the impact can be
as far as future generations wanting to know about it and trying to learn something
from it. But just having it is not enough.

Q: Your response to the current rise of Holocaust denying?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 8 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 81

A: Well, you read about that, and that there is. And it’s-it’s more disturbing in places
like Russia, because it pervades high levels (you know) of government. It’s not the
same as the British (you know) group who are obviously out of— out of line [there]
with the— with the broad population. But it’s-it’s there. And of in Iran it’s a— it
serves a purpose. It’s simply one of the mechanisms. So yes, you have to be
concerned about it, but you have to take 1t— In order to deal with it, you have to
take it in the context of where-where it is, and what purposes it serves in that local
environment.

Q: Are there political issues now you care very much about?

A: Yeah, I care about the— our government, the elections coming up. I think our
government is-is not working well for us, and it should not continue, and that what
comes after it is-is better, not just indifferent.

Q: Do you know who you’re voting for?

A: I don’t feel that I need to decide it right now. I cannot influence that choice. I mean,
I know I wouldn’t be— I most likely will be voting Democratic. But who that will
be, I don’t know. And who will be on the Republican side, I don’t know either. So—
And that’s important to know.

Q: There was a special relationship between Jewish Americans and the black
community in America. That’s changed over the years.

A: Well, nowadays the minorities in the— 1n the spotlight is the Hispanics, the
immigrants. And I don’t understand all the ramifications of the different policies
towards them, but being an immigrant, obviously I would tend to favor their-their
welfare. (I’m going to need a break sometime.)

[Tape 9]

Tape 9 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 82

Q: The word mercy?

A: The word mercy. I’m trying to think of the dictionary kind of definition of
“mercy.” It’s— What comes to mind is, mercy implies the— having the power for
forgiveness, the-the choice to forgive or not to forgive. And who has— Who has
this-this power, the— You’d have to speak of specific situation. If you’re a judge,
you can have mercy. If you’re in some relationship with one person has some
powers over the other person, you have the power for affecting that other person.
So how you fit something like that into what we’re talking about, I really don’t
know. I don’t think it’s-it’s relevant to me, in that kind of an interpretation.

Q: Relevant only in terms of what you describe as understanding.

A: Yes.

Q: That things have evolved.

A: (Right.) The— yeah. You have— that you can— You should have understanding,
which does or does not affect that other person, your— whether you have it or you
don’t. But it affects your view of the other person’s activities. That’s kind of in a
more limited scale.

Q: Has the world changed since the Holocaust?

A: All the world has changed tremendously. I mean, there’s so much of it that I used
to understand, that I don’t understand. I mean, look at the equipment we’re using,
that the kids are using. (you know) And it-it has broad implications in terms of
people’s lives.

Q: How it’s changed since the Holocaust.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 9 SAM SCHALKOWSKY page 83

A: Yes, .. the world has changed a lot, certainly technologically, in terms of relations
between countries. We all (you know) hear about this globalization, but there is
more— Look at Europe. Talking about the United Europe, in terms of post World
War II, I mean, that’s was not thinkable. And of course this whole terrorism
business, that’s a major, major influence on the lives of people, the relationships
between different peoples. There’s different concerns. I mean, to think of (you
know) suicide bombings would be so prevalent, so easily (you know) organized as
a means— as a mechanism for war, I mean, that was not thinkable 60 years ago.

Q: Or very rare, I guess.

A: Yeah. They were considered (you know) outside the human (kind of) race.

Q: The value of testimony for prevention. You said the ingredients are still there. What
did you mean by that?

A: Well, if you look at the people involved in something like a holocaust on this scale,
you’d start with the criminal mind, the pathological (you know) murderer, which
we had in-in the camps. They were running Kaiserwald, for example, Germans who
were not suitable to live in this violent Nazi world. They were too violent for that.
Or I should say, their violence was not controllable. But they could be let loose
(you know) in a camp to control the Jews. Well, the jails are filled with some
people like that. All they need is to be given the opportunity. They don’t need the
theory. They don’t need the Aryan kind of philosophies. They just need an
opportunity to do what they want to do. And they’re there.

And then you go on (you know) from there. At the other extreme, the-the
ideologues, the theoreticians who can justify, provide a rationale, so that all these
people in between have a way of rationalizing their participation. Well, the
theoreticians (you know) are there. The Osama bin Ladens are there. So the
rationale can be (you know) made available, and— (not necessarily the Osama bin
Laden type) and there’s all these people who, in between, who are given
opportunities that is of some benefit to them, for them to want to rationalize their

departure from their moral— their own moral standards. So it just— you just have to
have all these— all these things come together to create the Holocaust. But the
ingredients are there. They’re not, fortunately, no-not coming together, certainly
not in this country yet.

Q: But that is what you meant when we talked about Bosnia, Darfur, Rwanda? Those
ingredients are there.

A: Right. They were there. They’re there in Darfur. And we had no influence on the
way this was made to come together.

Q: Are you less politically active in something like Darfur, or more?

A: [overlap] Yes. Politically I’m less active. Yes. I-I don’t go to demonstrations,
although I certainly support their being. But that has more to do with limitations of
age, I think, although I never participated in demonstrations to speak of.

Q: Is there value in the concept of mercy or forgiveness even in the face of evil, even
if it wasn’t relevant in terms of your own experience?

A: That-that— This notion of-of mercy and its importance 1s difficult for me to address
because I think it-it is most common, or perhaps fits best, in a religious context.
And I must say that when I find out, as-as I know, that most of the [city] population
in this country is religious, they believe in a God, and I don’t, and I say, ““What’s
the matter with me?” Now, we’re in the minority. (you know) But my beliefs are
real to me. And I think 1n the— perhaps in the context of-of religion, it has— it has a
place. But not to me outside of that context.

Q: In our criminal justice system, mercy has a place?

A: You mean, outside the religious context. [ Yes, yeah.] Then-then it-1t goes into—
again into the thing we talked about before, that it fits into situations where the one

having the power for mercy has the power to make it— make it— have an—a real
effect. I mean, a judge has the power for mercy, and his decision has very real
consequences. But for me to say I have mercy, so what? It’s-it’s not-not a
meaningful kind of thing.

Q: It would be interesting to see if any of that had value in terms of how one moved on
in life. Is that useful or effective in doing that?

A: I think from (you know) some instances that I have heard about, yes, some
survivors declare their— that they have for— they forgive (you know) the
perpetrators. But I think you find that is connected to religious notions. It doesn’t-
doesn’t— It supports their religious belief structure.

Q: But for you, no, either way.

A: No. To me, I guess I-I just am too—too down-to-earth, if you will. It has to have
some practical relevance to mean something to me. Now, to many people, to most
people, faith has a very practical relevance, so the concept can be meaningful to
them.

Q: This interview today, not a narrative, your thoughts. What value, if any?

A: I don’t know. I’m waiting to see. [laugh]

Q: is it a different kind of conversation?

A: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It’s— tends to be much more philosophical, which may
or may not be of interest to people. Maybe some little bit here and there might be. I
think you’ve covered a lot of territory, and— So I-I think the purpose of finding—
(you know) of creating an educational tool which goes beyond the narrative, I
think, is a very useful instrument in trying to-to advance this building of

understanding the Holocaust, not just knowing what it is. So I hope it will serve
that-that purpose.

Q: Is there any—

A: That’s why I’m doing.

Q: Is there anything I should have asked you but I didn’t?

A: You asked a lot. [laugh] Maybe there’s something that I could think of that I wish
you hadn’t asked me, because (you know) it’s uncomfortable to— especially to
make pronouncements that I’m not so sure I’m (you know) qualified to make.

Q: Thank you.

A: I have a request I’m going to make to you. [ Yes.] I decided there is a price for doing
this interview: that I would like the museum or you, however it happens, to provide
me with a copy of my interview, not just the little pieces that you pull out, if that’s
possible. And in fact, three copies.

Q: We’ll pass that on.

A: That’s the payoff.

Q: I bet it will be possible, is my guess, Sam.
