had no means of self-support so, beside this small amount of UNRHA money and so he took a
room in some poor little area, one of these funny hotels, shabby looking hotels and he got a job
as an usher in a movie theater. You know the guy with a uniform and a flashlight. That was the
only thing he could do cause he didn’t know any English so when people heard about him,
people at the Seminary heard about him, they took him in right away. And that’s how he was
saved. He was an excellent student and he —

Carol: Yeah, Korgel. And we went let’s see where else. Oh Warsaw. There 1s a big building
where the main synagogue was. I don’t know. It was like cars or car repairs, but a very elegant
large building. And then that was the beginning of the ghetto. But the ghetto of course was torn
down and rebuilt. They have seen built buildings, houses where people lived. But it was right
there, right near the synagogue.
Q: When your children were growing up, did you tell them about what happened to you and your
experiences? Did you talk about it a lot with your children?
A: I don’t remember.
Carol: No he did not because if we did say anything or I would say something, he would just
brush us off and say well Pll give you some books to read. You can read about it because it was
too difficult for him to face. And this is why he didn’t write any books about his experience. And
that’s why we’re so glad to be able to talk to you or somebody so that some of his, some of their
understanding can rub off and they’ Il be a little more knowledgeable.
Q: Do you think you would have been a different person today if you hadn’t gone through what
you went through?
A: I don’t know. I prepared myself. I was known. My father with a few other people did,
brought special teachers, specialty for me because for me and a few other people, because we
wanted to. And —
Q: You’re talking about the studies?
A: Yes, I, in addition we studied beyond the normal that children go. We went a little higher in
situation.

poor quality and then they went to high school. Oh yes my oldest son went to a good day school.
Yes, Marc used to schlep them back and forth —
A: Maimonides.

and then go back Sunday night. They boarded with a family and it was expensive but we were

Carol: Ok. The children when they graduated from high school they got into Brandeis and one
son went to the University of Connecticut. So when they were at Brandeis they made friends of
course and they, that was where they settled and they just felt at home and why else would they
go somewhere else. They felt. And then why else would where’d we go. So we settled in
Brookline also for the same reason. Cause we have four grandchildren now. And so it doesn’t
make sense to go off to California or something.
Q: Do you remember the Eichmann trial, and if so what your thoughts were during that?
A: I am, I have been a reader of newspapers, even I still was in Ciechanow as a young boy. I
remember that the director from the school Rabbi Ava Keremon was, lived next door to me, to
us. So and I was a reader and on one can read some Hebrew and he couldn’t make out one
word. He came to me and asked me and he was the principal of the schoollikea .

Q: Are there any sounds or sights or smells that bring it back, that sometimes make you think
about Auschwitz or Golleschau?

Interview with Marc Samuels 4]
July 25, 2014
Carol: Interestingly there was a fellow in his house, his house where he was living before he was
taken away by the name of Leventhal, Zalman Leventhal. And it’s strange by coincidence this
fellow became a Sondercommander at Auschwitz. I think he was in charge of putting dead
bodies into the crematorium. And this is a fellow that Marc temporarily went to school with. But
eventually he was murdered and then also he wrote a lot of information. I don’t know if it’s a lot
of information. But he wrote information and hid it around the concentration camp. So he must
have left a little bit of a legacy but it can be seen and there’s a mention of this Zalman Leventhal
in the Auschwitz album. I don’t know if you know about that. It’s a book. So there’s a mention
of Zalman so it was a coincidence. He lived in the same house as Marc in the
A: And I had another thing to say, to write about him. He’s the one who convinced me to go to
yeshiva and of the garon, you know what garon 1s.
Q: The garon, yeah.
A: After yeshiva which was lahonum vashenem, the famous, a famous big, and the lahonum
vashenem, I went there to yeshiva. They took me in and one of the people there came over to me.
And can you please do me a favor. I said, what, of course rabbi. I need ink to write. I says Pll
go out and get ink. And then I got homesick. I went home. I left and a few months after that
lahonum vashenem was killed. And then that’s another story.

A: Yad Vashem.
Q: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that we haven’t covered. Anything that you
might —
A: I might. I don’t know.
Carol: There’s one thing. It’s not important but it seems that there are certain people who were
better liked than other people. I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other
people. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was
very weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn’t and there was no
medicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please
come in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don’t know how
many days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are
going to come and make a selection.
A: That was in camp.
Carol: Yes, that’s right that was in camp and so they quickly hustled Marc out of there and then
of course the guards picked out whoever they wanted.

Carol: And by the way Schindler’s list and sometimes there might, probably are other movies
which touched on the Holocaust. That you saw the prisoners eating. Now Marc says that nobody
sat down. They weren’t allowed to sit down while they ate. They all had to stand around and eat.
But that just goes to show the inhumanity of these people. They were sadist. They were very
sadistic. They were pathological murderers and criminals. They were sociopaths and
psychopaths. And this 1s the existence they had to live among. These crazy hateful people.
A: Thad, Jewish people, very nice people that were my friends. All the nice people were friends.
Carol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the
war when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn’t know whether to buy German
products or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently
who won’t buy at Trader Joe. I don’t’ know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They
will not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses
and trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we

not buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of
Israel’s good friends. They don’t have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China.
There is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so —
A: I get that sub —
Carol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn’t suffer enough. The Germans didn’t suffer enough.
And they didn’t. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the
Eichmann trial and a few other places. But they didn’t suffer enough.
A: Of course you know they all committed suicide.
Q: Tell me the names of your children and grandchildren.
Carol: You want to tell her.
A: You have better —
Carol: Ok our oldest son’s name is Steven. I know this is a Christian name which is a popular
name among Jews because there are so many Shmuels around and so we, since our last name
was Samuels, and Marc wanted to call him Samuel, Samuels. That’s what his name would have
been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel
Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an
assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came
across the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out
that the guy’s name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn’t even sound possible but he
wasn’t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we
called him Steven for that reason.
And then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this
crust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh yes he was

beaten up and they took his boots away. I don’t know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his
boots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do.
Q: This was a friend of Marc’s.
Carol: No this is Marc’s brother.
Q: Oh Marc’s brother. No he didn’t say that.
Carol: Yes. Steve’s middle name is Jonas or Yona after his brother.
A: He was murdered in Auschwitz.
Q: And your other children’s names.
Carol: Oh yes, oh that’s right. So that Steven Jonas Samuels. And Jonathan Gabriel Samuels.
Gabriel was my grandfather’s name. Jonathan sounds like Jonas and so I kind of snuck that in
cause you are not supposed to give the same name to your children. So in Johan’s time. Then
David. I always liked the name David. It’s just the ultimate Jewish name. I feel the Jewish, the
most meaningful Jewish name I think. So David Michael. Since Jonathan’s middle name is
Gabriel. I have one angel. I named David, David Michael, the other angel. And then Debby is
Marc’s, Marc’s mother. Deborah, Devora. So she has the name of Devora. Let’s see.
A: She’s a professor in the college, in Wheelock college here.
Carol: Yes, Wheelock College. She just came back from Italy and she was also in Munich
teaching the Holocaust. This is her second trip in the course at Wheelock College. It was highly
interesting and she got a lot of students to go with her.
Q: Have you worked?

Interview with Marc Samuels 46
July 25, 2014
Carol: I personally. No because I was filled with kids and also there were a lot of synagogue
things I had to go to. All the bar mitzvahs and the Hadassah and the Sisterhood, and the
Sisterhood board, the Hadassah board. And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is
very nice but enough is enough. So I didn’t, but I did go to school at night. I didn’t go to, I
didn’t graduate college because my parents just didn’t have the money. My father was divorced
and their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years
or more, 12 years to get my bachelor’s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in
Washington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I
went to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree.
Oh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in
teaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I
had nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I
got another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I’ve kept myself busy at
night but not to get too involved with his work.
Q: Is there anything else, a message to your grandchildren, Marc, that you would like to give or
anything else you wanted to say before we close?
A: Grandchildren, they’re very young now.
Carol: Nobody is really interested in becoming a rabbi and not only that but we’re very
disappointed that they don’t even take books out of this very large library. Marc donate more
than 1500 books to the University of Connecticut, where he taught by the way and we still have
over about 1600 books left right now in our very small apartment. So we really don’t know what
to do about that. So we have one of the largest book collections that any Judaica library has.
And it’s called the Rabbi Marc E. Samuels Judaica collection. Yes. So they’re not interested for
some reason. Of course they’re very young now. But they probably will be interested later on but
we still don’t know what to do with them. We moved into assisted living.

Interview with Marc Samuels 47
July 25, 2014
Q: Well thank you very much for doing this interview and I just have a few closing words I
wanted to say. And so if you could just wait one moment, unless there’s something else you
wanted to add. Is there anything else you wanted to add or do you feel you’ve said —
Carol: Yes, about Germany today. Years ago Marc mentioned the fact that the Germans of today
are not necessarily the way they were or not the same country as it was. And that you can’t
blame Germany, German people today at least most of them. There’s always anti-Semites
around. That you can’t get mad at them. They had nothing to do with it. But the fact that they
are supportive of Israel is a very good, it’s a good sign. Now they’re pretty sick and tired of the
Bittegoodmachen [ph] I think it’s called giving all this money away as a pension.
Q: Do you get money from Germany?
A: I do.
Q: You do, you still do?
A: Yes. And —
Q: How do you feel about that?
A: No. I, they took money from me. I came to Washington with some money put into my body,
hidden and then they took it everything. Now —
Carol: They took his father gave each child money. I don’t know how much it was, like about
$200 or something like that.
A: I don’t know.
Carol: And —

A: I got 500 —
Carol: Like it was folded up and put into their behind, in their rectum and that’s how they hid it
and for the girls they gave extra money. But when they got to the camps there was no way that
they could hide it anymore. And it was useless anyway. You couldn’t buy your way out. They’d
kill you anyway, after taking the money.
Q: Those are all important stories. I just wanted to thank you for doing the interview and we will
close now by my saying this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview
of Marc Samuels.
A: I want to mention one, one thing more. It’s not about me but I was present, eyewitness to it.
There was a family. He went to the Geresh Tebel [ph] here. He was an Orthodox person and he
and -
Carol: Did you lose your train of thought?
A: Yes, yes. Don’t take for granted that this is all I have to say. Yeah.
Q: Thank you again for doing the interview. Let me just repeat that this concludes the interview
of Marc Samuels.
A: Ok.
