[Tape 10]

Q: Say your name.

A: My name is Robert Behr, and I’m right now 85 years old.

Q: Where are we?

A: We are in Maryland, Gaithersburg, you’re being specific, and on 70 Chase Street,
and that’s about it.

Q: In your home?

A: It’s my home.

Q: Do you have family? How many, who they are?

A: Well, of course I have my wife, and I have a daughter here, who has two children,
they’re twins, and I have a daughter in Denver, who has two boys. So I have four
grandchildren and two daughters altogether, and their-their ages are, as I said, 9
years old (the twins) and the other ones are 16 and 14—13.

Q: How important is family in your life?

A: Well, knowing that I lost my immediate family in Germany to the Holocaust, all I
have is what I got up here. I have no uncles, never had any brothers and sisters, I
had no aunts, and they’re all killed. So what I have here now is really my entire
family, as I just described it.

Q: How do you describe yourself? As a husband and a father?

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 2

A: Well, it depends who you ask. (you know) If you ask me, I think I’m perfectionist
by itself, I’m a little demanding, because I want things to do right, and I do the
best I can for my family. I’m not always as patient as I should be, but as a whole,
I think if you were to ask my kids, they would agree that I’m a very good provider
and father to raise them and take care of them in their need. They come to me
when they need something. Whether it’s advice or something financially, they
come to me. I’m their first stop, other than their husbands, to come to me. So I
think I’m, on all, a decent father.

Q: Given your background, how did that affect your parenting?

A: I’m not quite sure of the question. What do you mean?

Q: Given your Holocaust wartime experience, how that impacted you as a parent.

A: That’s a very interesting question. I have to go back a little bit. If you know about
the Holocaust, you know that the Nazis created several categories of Jewish
people. There were Jewish people with both parents, and there are people who
were out of mixed marriage, one Christian partner and one Jewish partner,
regardless of whether the man is Jewish or the wife 1s Jewish and the other party
is Christian. So I was very concerned, because the mixed marriage— children from
mixed marriages or the mixed marriages themselves were protected to some
degree for some of the horrors which transpired to the— during the Holocaust. And
I was always wondering. I’ve never said that to anybody. You are really, literally
the first one.

When I got out of the camp after four years in there, I thought I would [not]
marry a Jewish woman, because I didn’t want my children to be full Jewish. I
figured, if they are [in] a mixed marriage, then if there ever is another holocaust
with the same criteria as the Nazis were, then they would to-to a degree be
protected because they were— the German word is Mischlinge (that means mixed
religions), and protect them. And I deliberately did not marry a Jewish woman. I

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 3
did not look for one, because I wanted to have my children born of a mixed
marriage.

Q: That was your fear that it could happen again?

A: Yes. The idea that the Holocaust may be repeated 1n one form or another was so
definitely embedded in my mind in 1945, when we were liberated, I did not ever
believe that there wouldn’t be a holocaust against the Jews. I mean, there have
been other holocausts, as you know, but I was convinced that the Jewish people
would be subject to another holocaust on equal or worse conditions as the first
one, and I wanted to do everything in my power to avoid that. Now, I’m not very
proud of this today, I am not very happy about it, but that’s how I felt in 1945,
just coming out of a camp, having lost all my uncles and aunts. I wanted to protect
any children I may have from that fate.

Q: How do you feel about that same issue today, in 2007 in America?

A: Would I— Would I do this all over again if I were to be married today, picking a
wife simply by ethnic background rather than the normal conditions of love and
affection? Probably not. Probably after 60 years [of the] war, I sort of [became]
convinced that my anxieties and my fear were probably not justified as far as the
Jewish people in America or other places were concerned. There’s anti-Semitism,
as you know, everywhere. But it doesn’t manifest itself by killing everybody left
and right, just because we’re Jewish. So would I do this again? No, I would not. I
would probably marry the person I love, regardless of her ethnic or religious
background.

Q: Do you feel fairly secure today, being Jewish in America today?

A: Well, it’s a very interesting and I will be quite honest. I never volunteer that I’m
Jewish. I mean, if I work in a Holocaust Museum, where there are a lot of non-
Jewish people working, I let the people believe what they may. But I’m still

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 4
reluctant, to this day, to go out and say, “I’m Jewish.” And I can tell you, if
somebody call—tells me “He’s a Jew,” I really get offended, because I rather
prefer that somebody says “He’s Jewish.” I never volunteer that. If it comes up, I
don’t deny it. But I’m not going out .. (excuse me) and voluntarily say, “Oh yeah,
I’m Jewish.” I don’t do that.

Q: So if I ask you to give me a sense of your identity, how you identify yourself?

A: Good question. How would I identity myself? If I tell you the truth, as an
American citizen of Jewish faith. No. The order of importance is the American
citizenship, and the religious aspect is secondary, since I’m not raised as a
religious person in the first place. So I would feel quite secure, but I would never
volunteer to go out and advertise my Jewishness. Other people are proud. They-
they obviously tell everybody who needs to know, “Yes, I’m Jewish and I’m
proud of it.” I would never do that. I would— I would accept being Jewish, but I
don’t advertise it.

Q: Based mainly out of fear?

A: I think it’s inborn now. It’s— There is actually no physical fear. It’s good question.
But it’s—it went— It went with me for so many years. From 1933 to 1945, it was
terrible to be Jewish. And it’s not fear so much as habit. You know? You
actually— It becomes second nature not to advertise it. Now, that’s very personal.
That is not true for all the Jewish people. But for me, it is.

Q: How would you describe your personality?

A: Well, I don’t know how much time we have, but in any case, my personality is
shaped by the fact that for many years I was denied any opportunity to be
somebody, to become somebody, to have something, and so that has ruined my
life. I by— I am by nature a very ambitious person. Can be detrimental to your
marriage, in many aspects. And it’s difficult to say but you want me to be honest,

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 5
that my work came first, my career came first, and my family came second.
That’s another thing I’m not very proud of, but that’s true. I wanted to make
something. I had no education. I had no experience. So everything you see today
and hear is made out of the idea: I’ve got be somebody, I have got to achieve
something in life, and I don’t want to be a non-entity, as I used to be for so many
years. So that shaped my-— the fact that I knew nothing, had nothing, and wanted
to become somebody, that is the driving factor. So “ambition” is probably a catch
word for that.

Q: Ambition is related to a sense of a lost identity and loss of control?

A: Oh, that’s absolutely right. I was driven by those things, and it shaped my life. It
shaped my career, it shaped what I did, and I wanted to get as high up as I can,
and I wanted to be somebody who is recognized for his ability, not by his Jewish
faith, but for his achievement in life and what he can do.

Q: Who were you before the Holocaust? Describe that boy.

A: In one word, I— the boy I was, in-be— During the Holocaust, while we were still
in Germany— Remember, the Holocaust started in 1933. I was 11 years old. And
so it totally shaped my life. It— Of all these stories which are about the Holocaust,
95% of them apply to me: no school, no-no money, no nothing. And so you
become a person who- a bare existence. To survive, even before the concentration
camp, was of major importance. You were subject to the whims of any German
who didn’t like your face or didn’t like your attitude. He could do something,
could denounce you, and the end would be there, you see. And so that is such
strong factors, you don’t easily get rid of them. You don’t easily get rid of them.
And they stay with you. And it takes a very strong person to not only create a
physical life but a psychological existence, where you feel that you are among
people who accept you for what you are, rather than deny you because of what
you are.

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 6

Q: At your age today, how do those things still inform your life?

A: Well, the best— How do I deal with those factors? Well, the easiest way is what I
just told you. I do not advertise ’'m Jewish. I’m not proud of to be Jewish. I hide
it. If somebody asks me, I admit it, but I would never volunteer it. That’s a direct
outgrowth of the fact that when you lived in Germany from ’33 until we were
arrested in °42, that 1t was something shameful, something miserable, something
not worthy, to be Jewish. The German people denied you the right to be a
German. And now that I’m an American, I’ve slowly changed, but it sits in there.
It sits in there. And I try not to make, any way, form or shape, something out of
this background of mine, but it still hangs in there.

Q: Would you describe yourself as a trusting man?

A: Well, the answer to— Am I a trusting man? Well, yes and no, of course. Yes, as far
as my family is concerned. Yes, as far as a few friends I have. No to the majority
of the world. I-I view the world with a degree of skepticism. Not necessarily do I
condemn them anything, but somebody who is my friend has to earn that. I don’t—
I’m not a warm person in the sense that I embrace people who happen to come
into my life. I’m sort of reserved and keeping a distance, and then as connections
develop, we become to [known]. If you ask me how many friends do you really
have, I would tell you I have one. I have lots of acquaintances, but I’ve only got
one friend. And he, of all people, is a German Christian, so— But just to show you,
I do not make friends very easily. And that is something I have to live with. And I
cannot change my personality to the degree that I suddenly become a warm,
hospital-hospitable person who embraces people for their existence, for their
being, without knowing anything about him.

Q: In terms of emotional/psychological wounds, what do you see in yourself? What
have you tried to overcome, and to what degree have you been successful?

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 7

A: Well, basically— Let me think about your question. You want to know what the
psychological factors are, [to do— to—] in my present conditions in life. I’m
basically suspicious; I’m very basically very careful with whom I associate. I
mean, I don’t mean professionally. That’s something— you earn a living, you
accept the people who work with you. But in my private life, 1t’s rather empty. I
do not easily go out with them. So those are hangovers, direct relationship. When
I lived in Germany during the Nazi time, you couldn’t trust anybody. You
couldn’t like anybody. They didn’t want you to like them. So you were limited to
the few Jewish family with which my mother was acquainted, and which I knew,
d their children. But as a whole, the idea—

For example, I don’t like— I’m not a good host. Let me describe this. Other
people, they love— Americans, for example, born Americans. They have a saying
that says, “Why don’t you come over for dinner?” They just met half an hour ago.
Never do that. I mean, Europeans wouldn’t do that anyway, and I wouldn’t do this
in particular. And I am not a very gracious host. I am reticent to be a cordial,
open, slap-shoulder type guy. So those are really hangovers from— little bit from
my family life, because my mother was [at] about the same [trends], and so have
I. I hope that sort of explains it.

Q: Have you seen changes in yourself over the years that you’ve been here? Are
there things that have softened or lessened?

A: The issues which you’re raising, whether my life is today different than it used to
be right after the war and for the following years, my gosh, the war is 60 years
ago. Yes, it definitely has. I become calmer, and I am now in a fortunate position
to have retired with a pension, which is [where] I’m very grateful for, that has
eased my anxieties about not having anything, not knowing where the next meal
comes from, which was the case in Germany, which definitely was the case in the
concentration camp, that— So to some degree, I am accepting the world today as
an open opportunity, as something I can live with. Don’t necessarily have to be
happy all the time, but I have changed to that degree that Iam much more a

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 8
person who is accepting its presence and not constantly thinking: What if? What
happened in the past, can it happen again?—as I did in ’45, when I decided to
marry a Christian woman to save my children from the gas chamber. That, I
would never do. So time has healed, absolutely.

Q: When did you tell your children about your war/Holocaust experiences and about
their Jewish identities?

A: Well, that is a very good question. What did I tell my children? Well, I told them
as much as they needed to know. I never had the problem like some survivors,
that they didn’t want to talk about anything that happened to them. I did. When
they’re about 12 or 13 years old, and they were living with us in Ohio, we— I used
the occasion when their history— in school, when their history reached World War
II, and I used that as an occasion and said, “I want you guys to listen to
something. And here is my story.” And I did tell them. I’m not sure they grasped
everything, because it was an enormous burden on them suddenly to find out that
their father was 4 years 1n prison and lived under conditions which were less than
human. And so they accepted— They were shocked. They were actually shocked.
Then I noticed that they began sort of ad— to admire me, you know, and saying,
“My dad made it,” you know. They didn’t understand it wasn’t only my doing,
but they were sort of proud that they made it.

Now I need to ask you to understand that my family in Denver, they are
married— they-they are not Jews. I mean, they’re Jews on a piece of paper, but
that’s about it, because there’s also a mixed marriage, and they are not raised in
the sense that they have compassion with the Jewish faith as it happens through
the centuries. You know. My local daughter and her husband are very Jewish.
And he’s from Montreal, and was raised very Jewish, and they’re much more
receptive to the fact that I work in a museum, that I try to spread the word by
giving speeches about my life. So in that respect, I must say that I have sort of
half and half: one family who knows of, and said, “Oh yeah, well, my dad was-—is
a survivor,” and then let it go; while my younger daughter is much more saying in

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 9
pride, “My-my dad made it,” you know, and tells people what-what happened to
me as far as she remembers.

Q: Are you pleased either way? Does it matter to you?

A: Well— Am I pleased, and does it matter? Well, it doesn’t matter. Am I pleased? I
feel, with-with-with my-my-my older daughter who’s 49 years old, and was never
very much— We were never a religious family, never, ever. So [along where] we
were a mixed marriage. And so I accept that. I mean, she lives her life, and the
Jewishness 1s there, she knows it of course, but it’s not a big part of her life. The
other one here is more Jewish, and I’m proud of them, but— You see, religion has
played a very small part in their lives, the kids’ lives. They’re not-not religious.
They don’t keep kosher [in any way, in any ...... same]. So in the old German—
When-when-when the Germans first began to [prosecute] the Jews— Now, I’m not
going to tell you my life story. I know that’s not what you want. But there was a
slogan. If somebody asked you, “What are you?” you always said, “I’m a German
citizen of Jewish religion.” So what comes first? The German citizenship. And
that’s the same here with us. We are Americans, we’re proud of it, we believe in
it, we want to be Americans, and the religion aspect is a fact you live with, and
you either practice it or you don’t, but it’s totally secondary to your [Jew-]
nationality and citizenship. [overlap] I don’t know if that makes sense.

Q: It does. In terms of identity, American citizenship comes before being German?
Do you consider yourself German still?

A: No. I do not. I some ways I do. I love German music. I love the culture. I love the
things [about it]. But— I’ll give you an example how strong that is in my family.

Q: Repeat, being German, the subject.

A: The fact, do you still consider yourself a German? Well, I do in some respect, as
far as the aspects of Germany are concerned which are cultural in nature, from

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 10
literature to music and the theaters and so forth. As a citizen, let me give you an
example. When I applied for my visa, I was interviewed by the American consul
in Berlin. And one of the (which I thought was rather stupid) question he asked
me is: If there would be a war between the United States and Germany, whose
side would you f-fight for? (you know) Well, obviously I wouldn’t- Remember,
that was in 1947, (1) shortly after the war. And I said, “Of course I would fight for
the Americans.” So what you— What America has given me, I can give you in one
sentence. That’s a Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is the most motivating factor,
for this immigrant, as I ever seen. That’s why I didn’t want to go to Israel. They
don’t have a Bill of Rights.

And to me, American was the epitome of a dream come true. When our ship
landed in New York in February of 1947, and we entered the harbor, and there
was the statue of liberty (see, it’s coming back; I’m beginning to cry), we all
cried. We literally cried. It was the most wonderful sight— Excuse me for being
sentimental, but it was something— It comes right back to me. You cannot
imagine. To enter this land as a free person. My God. What did we see in New
York, the first thing, was lights. Americans had lights. Everything in Germany
was destroyed. It was dark. It was miserable. And here were that country which
has asked us to come, allowed us to come, and so I’m not sure that answers your
question but it gives you an idea how we felt.

Q: You certainly answered that man’s question.

A: Yes.

Q: All these years later, when you think of America and the feeling of promise that
day, where you today?

A: Where am I today about America? I’Il tell you. I-I admire America, I love
America. I don’t always agree with America. I have my ideas what I would have
liked to see different. But as a whole, when you take the people, the country, its-
its laws and everything else, its Supreme Court, and as I said, the-the Bill of

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 11
Rights, I don’t ever want to be anything else but an American. Not ever. And
that’s not for convenience’ sake. That is something I firmly believe in. I’m 85
years old. If a war breaks out tomorrow and they need me, I go. May not be a very
brave soldier, but I would do my utmost to defend that what we got. And I hate to
see it go down the drain sometimes, but we will recover. We’ll come back to
where we should be, and that’s what I’m proud of.

Q: The Bill of Rights literally was—

A: That was my motivating factor.

[Tape 11]

Q: You described yourself as not being social, yet you’re also very charming, a good
speaker. Is that something you had to learn? Is it both things simultaneously?

A: Did I ever change or— due to my personality? The answer is yes, I think so,
because-— It’s difficult to quantify that. ’'m sorry, would you repeat that question?

A: That’s one aspect of your personality, the distrustful side. You have another side
to your personality, that stems probably as much from your background:
adaptability, resilience, powers of observation.

Q: Yeah. My personality, on your flip side, meaning looking at the more positive
side of my life, well, much of it was acquired. I’ve always been a person who
liked to deal with people. And I found people the most interesting element in-in
this world, rather than books or something like that. And so what happened 1s, as I
became mission-oriented (now, that’s a good old Air Force term), become
mission-oriented in the sense that you spread the word of what I’m doing, and
connected with that, I accept the people who are interested in this and people who
want to know more, people who are asking questions and saying, “How was it?
How 1s it? How do you feel now?”—essentially what you are doing right now.

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 12
And in order to answer this, you acquire a certain degree of charming personality
which is extroverted and becomes part, because if you want to spread the message
to anybody, you got to establish what we call rapport. If you don’t have any
rapport with anybody, you’re wasting your time. And so I have that desire, that if
I address somebody, whether it’s an individual or if it’s a group, I try to establish
a degree of rapport. I try to be responsive to their interest. And out of this
develops a degree of acceptability, with they accepting me, I accepting them, and
I’m happy that they’re listening to me; on the other hand, or if it’s social, and they
are interested in my life, you develop a degree of personality which 1s opposite
from what you really are. You know. It is actually more or less imposed on you
because— in order to do what you need to do.

Q: Does that ever create a tension in your life?

A: Does it create a degree of tension? The answer is no. It really doesn’t. That comes
from the age. (you know) I’m an old man today. I mean, let’s face it. And you
learn how to balance that out. It doesn’t have to cause a conflict. I don’t mean
necessarily that everything is glory and happiness, but as a whole, you learn how
to [adopt to this thing], and you try to reduce the negatives and accentuate the
positives (like the song said), and so that-that works.

Q: In order to survive the Holocaust, are there aspects of your personality that you
needed to develop to survive, that turned out 1ronically to help you in this life?

A: In order to summarize what you just asked me: What 1s the difference between a
life in a camp, the freedom, or how did it shape your personality between the two
of this?

Q: What were the threads? What turned out to serve you in life after the camp?

A: You already heard it, but I’ll repeat it. Remember that I told you a while ago, I’m
a very ambitious person? I want to put this into context. I came out of the camps

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 13
in May of 1945. I had no education, no money, no home, no country. And that has
shaped my whole personality. I wanted to be somebody. I wanted to have
something. I wanted to belong. That is a key factor. I wanted to belong. I was
looking desperately. Who-who am I?

Let me give you an example. I worked for a little while in a British officers’
club, being sort of a-a receptionist and one day I had the great idea. That was still
in 1945, maybe November, December. And I thought, well, maybe I can enlist in
the British army. Look at those guys. They got everything. They had uniform,
they’re respected, they had all the things I missed. So I went to one of the officers
and says, “Captain, what can I do to enlist in the British army?” And he said,
“Who are you?” So I told him, and he said, “Where are you from?” And I said,
“In-in— I’m from Berlin.” He said, “Well, you can’t.” I said, “Why not?” He said,
“Well, you’re a German.” And that is something I certainly didn’t want to hear,
being a German, after having just spent four years 1n a concentration camp,
arrested by the very German. So I said, “Well, I’m not a German.” “Oh yeah?” he
said. “Where were you born?” So I said, “Berlin.” He said, “Where’s Berlin
located?” I said, “In Germany.” He said, “Voila. You are a German. End of
story.” So you see, it-it all comes back what you make [of it]. Ambition and the
drive to belong. The British army didn’t want me because I was a German. May I
say that very honestly I certainly didn’t feel like being a German after being
persecuted from 1933 to ’45. But here he was, told me, very logical, “Berlin is the
capital of Germany, so you’re German.”

And so in answer to your question, it’s a desire to belong and a desire to be
among people who accept you for what you are, not ask about your religion or
anything else. And so that what drove me. That what really drove me. I was a
very lonely person with nothing. You know. My mother was still alive and— but
we had nothing. We were nothing. We were constantly told that we were no good.
And I wanted to be accepted. So those were the driving forces which shaped my
life ever since I survived the camp.

Q: So the promise of America was also the promise of belonging.

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 14

A: Yes, exactly. It was the-the idea, with-with arriving, going to America, being
accepted, believing that there is a country which had fought for us. They had
fought indirectly for the Jewish people, to liberate them. Didn’t always do a very
good job, but they tried their best. Thousands got killed, which in essence was
part of our salvation. And that was tremendously important to me. And I figured
that a country which does that, you know, which was attacked by Japan and then,
by Hitler declaring war on America, so these soldiers who went and fought,
fought for me. And that was one of the mer—very reasons why I wanted to go to
America.

Q: Over time, that started to shift? Did you start to feel less lonely, to belong?

A: I-I very definitely— you— How did-did I feel that belonging worked? Yes. and
what really did it: my service in the military. You cannot serve in the military
without belonging. You know. And the very fact that the Army accepted me. I
wasn’t even a citizen. I was not even a citizen. I was an alien. You know? And I
was accepted by the military, put in a uniform, shared all the miserable food, and
the training and everything else, and all of a sudden I had a home. The-the need to
belong ended right there, because I belonged. The need was gone, and the fact
were there that I was part of a military army which had stuck its neck out to
liberate us from the camps. So it was a very dominating factor in my life.

Q: How soon after coming to America did you join the military?

A: Well, I need to tell you, landing in America— Now, give me 5 minutes and I’1I tell
you. Landing in America was great. I already told you when we went [and
arrived]. We were sponsored by a Jewish organization, the Joint Distribution
Committee, and they put us up in the Hotel Marseilles in New York. And the next
couple days we were interviewed. And they had established a system where
various Jewish communities in the United States, in various cities (I don’t know
all the details), agreed to sponsor a refugee. So when my turn came to be
interviewed, they told me that number one, I can’t stay in New York. For some

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 15
reason, everybody wanted to stay in New York, most of the refugees, because
they felt at home or they had relatives up there. So I said, “Well, all right. I don’t
have anybody in New York anyway. What are my choices?” So they said, “Well,”
they looked at their lists and said, ““You can either go to Chicago or can go to
Dallas.” Had two minutes to answer that question. So, make a long story very
short, I rationalized it very cleverly. I figured Chicago there are gangsters, and in
Dallas there are cowboys, which are a lesser of two evils, and I wound up in
Dallas. That’s why I got to Dallas.

And I was miserable. I was absolutely miserable. Would you be interested to
know why? All right. I was miserable only because I had no money, no friends,
no nothing. The Jewish community in those days were not interested in refugees
or survivors. Not at all. They did it out of a sense of obligation to sponsor one or
two refugees, but giving speeches or asking me how was it in the camps, not once.
Not at all. Not ever. And they did their (quote, unquote) “duty” to sponsor
somebody, and I was very lonely, very miserable. I won’t go into details what I
worked at. They got me a job, which was terrible. And then there was no feeling
of belonging. My mother was still living in Germany and starving, ’47, ration
cards. And so I finally said, I can’t live lie this.

And then the Army became like a— I’ve seen the soldiers. Like the British
soldier I talked about, the American soldiers in Berlin, they had a good life. They
belonged, they did their job, they— and so forth. And I felt, that’s my answer. And
I enlisted in July of 1947.

Q: Given your background, was freedom a blessing and a curse, to live without
structure? Was that also why you were drawn to the army, to have a structure?

A: Definitely. The Army is something you are actually thrown into a structure. You
know when to get up, you know when to eat, you know when to sleep, you know
when to exercise. There are no question mark. They’|l tell you, especially in basic
training, 24 hours a day what you can and what you cannot do. A lot of people
resented it. I loved it. I was used to it from the concentration camp. They already

told me, except they beat you on top of it. The Army, no. They fed you, they
housed you, they [closed/clothed] you, and I got a lot of funny stories and— But I
all of a sudden felt nobody denied me as a person. They accepted me. And a lot of
people were so ignorant up there, they called me Frenchie instead of realizing that
France is not Germany. But it was wonderful. It was— I didn’t mind the hours, I
didn’t mind the drill, I didn’t mind the marches, but it was all part of belonging to
an organization with which you lived, where you belong, and where nobody
judged you what kind of religion do you have.

Q: Before the war, would you have had a very different sense of who you were?

A: Would I have been able to answer .....?

Q: How would you have answered it before?

A: Well, how would I have answered it? I was a totally different person. I was a
very—

Q: When? Before the war?

A: Yeah. Before the war, I was a young-young kid who had only a desire to live.
There was— There was no ambition, there was no nothing. All I want to do— Life
got so miserable and so desperate that all these dreams I had were on hold. I just—
I had only the desire to survive this, not knowing— We had no chance to emigrate.
The policies which existed did not allow that, because we didn’t have the
necessary background or relatives outside. So my personality during those day
would in essence be a day-by-day, a day-by-day existence. When you put your
head on a pillow at night, then you know you had one more day survived. God
only knows what’s going to happen tomorrow, where those guys (the Nazis)
passed laws [co-] constantly. So 1t was a matter of getting enough to eat when the
war started, because we didn’t get ration cards. I had a mother who was difficult,
to say the least, without going into details. So I was her only son, so I had to go

and take care of her in many aspects. So it wasn’t— There was no long-range
planning anymore. I’d given that up. I mean, I was no longer in a position to say,
“Well, when I got 18, I’m going to go’— I had no schooling. I was kicked out of
school and was not able to get into a Jewish school. Daily you heard transports
going off to the east after the war started. My uncle (my mother’s brother) and
family were arrested overnight. And so life was so different that long-range
planning, in my case, went totally out of the window. My was a day-by-day.
Today I survive, I hope tomorrow I will too. Does that give you some idea?

Q: Is that still in your life today? Do you have a different perspective on the future?

A: [overlap] Do I have a different perspective today?

Q: Because of that, did it inform everything about the future?

A: Yes. And unequivocally yes. My life is much more organized. Of course it’s
almost going towards the end now of my life. But when I was younger, when I
was 30-40 years old, it was driven by totally other factors. It was driven, like I
already outlined, to be somebody, to make [something of my]— to make my
mother— (my mother!) my friends proud of myself, especially my kids later. So it
was- I-I didn’t think about the time anymore, in the sense not that I’d forgotten it,
but I didn’t want it to dominate my life. I did not want the Nazi period to
dominate my life, like some other Jewish survivors. It dominates your life. It-it
influences— I didn’t want that. There are certain little things which hang on there,
but they’re minor. Okay? But basically, I wanted to shake that from my life.
Memories, I keep, but no more domination of the camp time and the Nazi
persecution. That is no longer something I want to dwell on.

Q: Why didn’t you want that?

A: Well, let me say, why didn’t I want that?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 18

Q: You said other survivors do. Why didn’t you want that to define your life?

A: Well, I-I didn’t want the persecution to define my life because what’s the use? I
mean, you cannot turn the clock back. It happened, it was there, it was a chapter
in my life, which (thanks God) I survived, and you look towards the future. You
just, “Where am I going from here?” Looking back and saying, “Oh my God,”
that’s fine when you talk to people who want to learn how it was. That’s fine, but
isn’t going to dominate my life, because my life is the future. My life is where I’m
going to go, not where I have been.

Q: The impact of the degrees of betrayal that you felt, to be German and to
experience what you experienced.

A: The dimensions and the degree of what I felt of being German. Now, that is a
question I just absolutely love, because when I start off giving my normal
speeches, I always tell the audience, if they’re old enough to understand, that
there’s actually two things to the Holocaust. One thing is the psychological, and
one is the physical. Well, everybody 1s familiar with the physically: concentration
camp, gas chambers, evacuations, all that. But the psychological aspect which I
stress, and what I ask my audience, I make them raise their hand. What
nationalities are you? They say American. Say, “What do you feel like about
America?” And they usually tell you they’re proud of it, blah-blah-blah. And then
I tell them, “Suppose one day somebody comes and says, ‘You have no more
rights. You don’t belong to us. We don’t want you. We gave you— We tolerate
you to stay in our country, but as far as belonging to us, that’s gone.’”’ And that is
what happened to us up here.

And in September of 1935, during the Nuremberg— and the Nuremberg laws
were passed, which in simple terms simply took our citizenship away, it made us
residents without any rights to [go]. That was a tremendous blow to my parents. I
mean, my father and my step-father both fought in World War I. We so
thoroughly believed in Germany. [And] more, much more which I have no time to
tell you. Suffice it to say that my parents considered themselves German first and

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 19
Jewish second. And “German citizen of Jewish faith” was the slogan we use.
That, I was raised. And it was— As the laws were passed, dis-discriminatory to the
Jewish faith, and 1t took away more and more of Germany itself. We were in
Germany, we spoke German, we still had access to German books, but the people
denied us. The people didn’t want us. The very things we-we wanted to belong to
said, “You may want to belong to us, but we don’t want you to belong to us.” So
the-the-the feeling that the German citizenship and the German country itself and
its people denied us, was a tremendous blow to us. In fact, to me, that was in
some ways equally bad than the physical aspect, which were bad enough. But to
lose one’s country, for which my uncle had died in World War I, my father and
biological father were both officers in World War I, fighting this country—

I'll give you an example of my family. My mother had a brother who was
what one commonly called a black sheep. What did you do with black sheep?
You send him to America. So in October of 1913, he went to New York and lived
there. A year later, not quite a year later, in Sept— in August of 1914, the war
broke out. And what did this guy do? He smuggled him— gave up his job in New
York, smuggled himself back on a Spanish ship to Germany, enlisted in the army,
and was killed in October. So that just gives you some idea how we felt about
Germany. My grand— My-my mother’s father committed suicide because he could
not stomach the idea that Germany had lost the war in 1918. In 1919 he killed
himself. And so that this illustrates.

I was young. I mean, I had not even the experience. I was growing up. But all
the things my parents talked forever about what Germany, its culture, its music,
its-its land, its territory, its trees. Germany is a very beautiful country. And it tells
us, “We don’t care how beautiful it is. You don’t belong in it.” And so that shaped
this whole thing, the torn between the admiration of my parents versus the Nazi
attitude and saying “We don’t want you.” Very difficult.

Q: Were you surprised by friends? What difference did it make on a personal level?

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 20

A: [overlap] Very, very definitely. I mean, very definitely, to a degree that some of
the kids I associated with suddenly would— didn’t want to play with me, didn’t
want to talk to me. Some of them told me, “Hey, my father won’t let me talk to
you. We’re not supposed to come and visit you anymore.” It went all over. Let me
give you an example of things which affected me personally.

We lived in an apartment house in Berlin, on the third floor, and-and we had
a small apartment, very nice. And one day in 1938, in summer of-— or spring of
1938 (I think it was March), we got a letter from the owner of the building and
said, “Mrs. Behr” (wasn’t “Dear Mrs. Behr’), “the-the inhabitants of the
apartments in this house have informed me that they no longer wish to live with a
Jew in the same building. Please remove yourself as soon as possible into another
place.” Those weren’t even the Nazis. Those were ordinary citizen like you and I,
who just happened to have another apartment up there. Now, I have no idea,
honestly, whether that letter was dictated. We got it. And it shook our faith,
because we always been good neighbors and congenial, friendly, and here they
tell they don’t wish to live with [us], in the same house with a Jewish family. It
hurts. And so those things shape your-your attitude towards a country which so
bitterly disappointed you.

Q: Do you ever recover from those hurts, as an adult?

A: Did I recover from? The answer’s 100% yes. And I will tell you what I mean by
this. Memories don’t fade. You can lose everything else, but you very seldom lose
memories if you’re healthy. So the memory sticks. And when I give a briefing
about my life, inevitably I get asked the question, “How do you feel about the
Germans today?” which is in essence what you are asking me. I will tell you
exactly how I feel about it. Completely neutral. I will not ever hold people
responsible who weren’t even born when their grandfathers committed the crimes
which were committed by the Germans. Those people are totally innocent. And
you cannot blame somebody for something his—his or her grandfather did, by-by
going out and shooting Jews in the woods. I mean, there is no way. So my ..

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 21
attitude towards the Germans is, I treat them just like a new country. I go there, I
go frequently over there, I love it there, I have no problem associating with them,
I do not begrudge the, I do not hold them, I hope that they are embarrassed about
it, and most of them are, wish it never happened, and— But to blame them and to
withdraw from them because of it, that’s not me.

Now, there are Jewish people who will not set foot into Germany again
because their feelings are different than mine. But mine, simply as I explained to
you: Don’t blame somebody for something which was happening two generations
ago.

[Tape 12]

Q: How 1s it possible, given what happened to you in Germany, to be secure in
America, identify yourself as American, and know that you could trust that?

A: How can I be sure that I can trust Americans?

Q: (You don’t always have to repeat the question. )

A: That’s a very difficult answer for me to-to give, because it took a long time for me
to be sure that things like this— You see, when I first came to America, there was
still very much discrimination against blacks. There was discrimination against
Jews. It was a very subtle type of discrimination. You would, for example, when
you looked for housing, find an advertising that a house 1s for sale, with a quote
that “Christian church nearby.” And those were indicator (which I learned from
other people who were here much longer) that this is a sign they don’t want any
Jews. Universities had quotas for Jewish students. And there was a degree of anti-
Semitism here. It wasn’t personally. Nobody came on your street and kicked you.
But it was there. There were certain class distinctions, and it took me a while to
get used to that. In fact, I didn’t even understand what it meant, “Christian church
nearby,” that that meant “We don’t want anybody [but] white Anglo-Saxon

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 22
Protestants,” you know. They weren’t even sure they weren’t Catholics. But those
things, you slowly accept and—

You got to remember that times change. America has become much more
liberal, much more liberal. I mean— I’Il give you a very personal example. One of
my children moved in with her boyfriend. And nobody raised an eyebrow. I
wasn’t very happy, my wife wasn’t very happy, but we are from another
generation. We didn’t stop them. But she didn’t experience any problems.
Nobody said, “How can you?” And so there was a— America has become a very—
much more liberal. It still isn’t 100%. No country is ever 100% liberal. But
America has changed much more. I mean, there are reasons for that. The Supreme
Court ruling about (you know) Roe versus Wade, and you have the integration,
school integration thing. So as a whole, Americans have changed to be more
liberal. Doesn’t mean you are liberally politically. That is a different story. I’m
not addressing it. I’m [dressing] it as socially. And that has slowly moved me too,
to the fact that I’m no longer worried that a holocaust would happen here. I was in
°45. I said, “No country is safe from having another holocaust.” And as indeed we
have. We had Cambodia, we had all sorts of holocausts. But in ’45, when I went
through the .. method of protecting my children with the fake birth certificates, so
to speak, that 1s gone now, because I see how America has changed. Much more—
America is much more accepting things which .... 50 years were roundly
condemned. And so it made me much more sure of myself. I’m now no longer
agonizing: Will there be a holocaust here? (you know, and—)

There’s a book from Philip Roth which he just wrote, that Lindbergh became
president, (you know) the very Lindbergh who was, deep down, a fascist. And he
becomes president of the United States. It’s a fiction. And he issues immediately
any anti-Semitic laws. So— But that’s fiction. People-people don’t no longer do
that. And so I’m fairly secure of myself. (you know)

Q: Were you more skeptical or wary of nationalism,(you know) patriotism?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 23

A: Nationalism and patriotism can be constructive or they cannot be. I mean, if you
interpret patriotism with the old saying, “Right or wrong, my country,” well,
that’s patriotism but it isn’t necessarily right. You have elements in our country
which consider themselves patriots, which I would not for a minute consider
patriots, because they deny the very things I’m proud of, (you know) like the
Aryan race and those-those elements up here. But again, you can live with that,
because you see, the major difference in all of this is the fact, in Germany it was
government-initiated and supported. Here it is not. It comes from the bottom up,
not from the top down. And that makes all the difference in the world. There still
is a Supreme Court. There still are the laws on the book that if they paint a
swastika on a synagogue, you can go and arrest them for defamation and that sort
of thing. So while not everything 1s perfect, and while (well) many things could
be better, they no longer impact my life in a negative way.

Q: Do you have a very strong sense of right and wrong?

A: [overlap] Well, do I have a sense— I think I do. I think I do, in a sense. It isn’t
governing my life, (you know) because there are many things I can’t do anything
about it. I mean, there are political questions, right or wrong, for my— which I
have no influence over whatsoever, other than taking a pencil every—
[interruption |

Q: The meaning of right and wrong for you in your life.

A: Well, the sense for right and wrong really is not an easy question to say, “I’m very
much for right and I’m very much against wrong.” That’s-that’s over-
simplification. It all depends in what context the question is asked. If I look at
discrimination in—against blacks, for example, obviously I feel that it’s definitely
wrong, you know. On the other hand, there are places where I feel very strongly
about. So on a personal level, I feel with acquaintances of mine very definitely a
sense for right or wrong. If they do something which I disagree with, and my
opinion is wrong, I will tell them if I can; if not, I will slow down my

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 24
acquaintanceship with them. If they do something right, I will praise them. You
know.

Q: When you came to America, you had to relearn how to live in a civilized society
after having had to do what you did to survive in the camp. How did that impact
you, then and later in your life?

A: The first thing I can say to this, that— about right or wrong, that I all of a sudden
found myself in a society which had laws, not anti-laws but positive laws, laws
which govern our life, which I may not always like or agree with it, but I came
into a society where the law went from the bottom up. It was created by Congress
and approved by the president. We had a society which based on law. Everything
here is based on law, because otherwise we wouldn’t have that many lawsuits.
You know. People can sue. People can try to equalize a wrong by going to the
courts and saying, “This is not right.” Was totally new to me. Totally new to me. I
had no idea that could even be done. Now, the Germans had courts during the
Nazi time. Oh, and they followed the law, except that the laws were terrible. You
know. If you listened to a foreign broadcast, the judge had no choice but to
condemn you to death. I mean, those are laws and laws. These laws here were
based on our Constitution, which again it contains the Bill of Rights. So you come
right back to the fact that living in this society took some adjusting. I mean, I
really wasn’t quite sure. Give you an example.

When I came, I had a knife with me to— in case something was wrong. I went
to the police station to register that knife. The guy said, “What do you want me to
do with that?” And I said, “Sir, I would like to be sure that you write on my
card’— He said, “I don’t have a card of you. Why should I have a card of you?” I
learned suddenly, this is not a country where everything is registered and (you
know) and noted down and so forth. In Germany, till today, when you move from
point A to point B, you got to de-register at one police station and re-register at
another one. So I-I was coming down to— when I went in Dallas, I moved once.
And the first time, I went to the police and said, “I want to register.” (you know)

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 25
These guys were very nice. They thought they’re probably dealing with some jerk
who doesn’t know what in the world he’s talking about. But they didn’t know my
background or anything else.

So this right or wrong becomes a very difficult thing to adopt to it, because it
is— we are governed by laws. (you know) May not all like the laws, but they’re
there. And they’re voted on. They’re not arbitrarily by one dictator says, “I want
this to happen.” And so all the laws we have went through a process of being
accepted or denied. But if they are accepted, then it’s a majority of something or
somebody who wants these law to be existing. So that took a while to get used to
it. Very difficult. Wasn’t even easy. But it was great.

Q: Even in terms of raising your children, were you comparing their lives to what
you had experienced?

A: As far as my own family is concerned, no. I didn’t. I mean, I’ve-I’ve divorced that
completely. They were raised in the society they lived in. I did not influence this
in any way. I accepted it, and my past did not (I) overshadow any of this. So that,
I divorced. I was even very able to do that.

Q: When you told your children about your background, how interested were they?
Did you talk to them in detail, or did you keep it superficial?

A: Did I talk to my daughters in detail? Well, sadly to say, I didn’t. But not because I
didn’t want to. They didn’t ask. My children know of course that I’m a Holocaust
survivor, and they know some of it, but in some ways they did not show the
amount of curiosity. My younger daughter much more than my older one. And
that is probably due to proximity. (you know) I’m here and the other one is in
Denver. But they did not, like so many young children— Let me give you an
example what I mean by this.

There are hundreds, hundreds of schoolchildren (seventh graders, eighth
graders) come to the museum. Okay. They get that on their itinerary and they
come in there. What I normally do with them, I give them a little quiz before I

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 26
send them up to the fourth floor where the Holocaust story begins. And I usually
ask them, “What museum are you in?” Half of them don’t know. I ask them,
“What is a holocaust?” And you would really be surprised. These children are not
particularly oriented, don’t even know. Said, “Give me another word for
‘holocaust.’” It’s not very difficult. You don’t have to say “genocide.” That’s
much too complicated. Say “mass murder.” That’s what it really is. And I’m
constantly amazed. But they don’t ask any questions.

Neither did my kids, even though they had an in-house capability to find out.
(you know) They listened. My daughter came and the first voices up there, she
came and listened to it, you know, and she congratulated me on my good speech
and so forth. But did she ask any questions in detail? Their lives are so full, and
they are— their lives are so engrossed in their daily activities, personally, I’m
afraid they don’t even want to know. They know the basic outlines and they know
what happened. Details: Did I have enough to eat? And if I did, what did I get to
eat? No. I try to tell them sometimes that our staple food was something— was
barley. They didn’t even know what barley was. And so instead of asking,
‘“What’s barley?” you know, and “How come?” it is “Ah, mm-hm, ah.” So it is—
My children unfortunately did not—- When they got older, sometimes they did. But
then they were married, then they had their own problems, they lived in their own
world.

And so no. The answer basically: My children— Now, it’s strictly personal.
My children did not demonstrate a degree of curiosity I was hoping they would
do. For example, both of them hate history. And now the Holocaust— you cannot
understand the Holocaust, you know something about history, World War I, the
loss, the Versailles Treaty, you know, unless you know sometimes. And I was
hoping that they would ask me some question: How did a Hitler come into power?
Well, Pll be honest with you. They never did. I shoved it down their throat
because I made them, but they did not, out of their own volition, come and say,
“Hey, Dad, tell us. What happened in Germany? How come they elected Hitler?”
You know. They didn’t. So for what it’s worth.

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 27

Q: When you do teach and speak with kids, what are you hoping it does?

A: Well, hoping is to spread the message, that there was a tremendous wrong
committed for no reason. I try to tell these people. And you see, again it depends
on the age. When you talk to graduate students, you get a wonderful reception.
They are interested. They know things. When you talk to eighth graders and you
tell them that 6 million Jews were killed, the best you can hope for, that they
would ask how. And then you tell them about the gas chambers, you know. But
the depth of the tragedy— (you know) In fact, I tell them: Two million of those
children were your age, who were stripped naked, shoved in a gas chamber, the
door was closed, and they pay— they died a painful death 15 minutes later. I look
at their faces, I see them, nobody cries, nobody looks shook. I mean, I-I— they-
they listen to hear the words, but the depth of this tragedy takes an adult. It really
does take an adult. And so it is difficult to communicate the tragedy of this
Holocaust to younger people.

Q: Is it also here in America we’re so removed, so protected?

A: Well, I think that’s absolutely right. The-the perception that this could happen in
my country, and may not be against Jews, it may be against Catholics, or 1t may
be against Muslims, you know. Muslims feel [prosecuted] here now, right or
wrong. And they— that— We are removed. But I don’t think that realization 1s
really set in that this could happen in our country. I don’t think these people are—
Not their fault. They think we’re so far removed that it’s an interesting story, it’s a
sad story, it should never happen again, but it will never happen to my country.

Q: For you, do you find there’s personal value in your testimony?

A: Well, is there personal value? All I can say, I hope so. I do my very best to
convey the tragedy in my own words. I try to make it so that each age group is
more or less involved, depending whether I talk to graduate students or eighth
grades, and so J tailor it that way. But to what degree I’m successful? There 1s a—

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 28
There is a sign at the Holocaust Museum, “Remember.” You know. It’s on the
outside when you come in. I’m not sure they remember very much. They-they
will go home and they will know there are tragedies. They are probably more
impressed to some degree of what they see there, [and] what they hear from a
survivor. But that’s probably not fair, because I don’t always know. I just have the
impression— For example, we recommend, the museum recommends that a visit to
the museum should be no less than 2’ hours, to walk through the Holocaust
story. When you see kids coming back in 45 minutes, and many do, you get an
idea of the perception which these kids have. They walk through because they
were told to do it. They look at some of the pictures. There’s nobody there to
explain it to them. (you know) We— The type of information I convey to you now,
they don’t have the benefit. These are objects which they see. Most [of] the time
when you ask them what was impressed you most, were the shoes which were
there, but is physical. The-the-the wagon, the railroad car, that’s physical. But
when you— For example, there is one where, from 1933 to 1945, it’s a rolling
thing on a TV screen, where all the anti-Jewish laws are passed, which to me is
the most frightening exhibit, not only because I lived there, but if I would see this
from another country—let’s say, a country in Africa which has a dictator, Idi
Amin, who had passed one law after another, if he—1if he didn’t kill them outright.
You go by there, that doesn’t mean and it doesn’t sink in. Each law is a tragedy in
itself. And you have to [take] the time, and you have to [do] the willingness to
read this and comprehend. What does that mean, that you cannot use public
transportation? Kids would say, “Well, we don’t have any public in Sheboygan
anyway, So what’s the big tragedy?” You know. Not realizing that Berlin was
much, much bigger, and we had to go to work. We were forced to go to work. We
couldn’t use public transportation. So the perception is difficult. And it depends
much on the age and the preparation of the children. There are exceptions. There
are some schoolchildren who come who are well prepared. The story of Anne
Frank, for example, is one of the wonderful examples where kids take an interest.

Q: Describe your first time going through the museum.

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 29

A: My first time going through museum? I found all the problems my first time, I
mean, I-I know things which the museum doesn’t reflect, and I was wondering
why it doesn’t reflect it. May I give you an example?

When you come out of the elevator, you see a huge picture of a policeman
and a Nazi party member and a dog, which faces you. Huge. I mean, it’s as big as
you can get. And it doesn’t say much. It just say “a Nazi party member” and that’s
all. There’s a little thing in that picture which 1s so important, that only people
like myself know that. The Nazi party member had a white armband. And that
white armband meant this: that after Hitler took power, right two days later, they
deputized all these hooligans with the— as deputy police people, with the same
right to arrest people. Suddenly you had millions of these guys who were
deputized as being authorized to release you.

Now, unfortunately, when you know as much as I do, that may be very
unfair. The— You notice in the museum the problems. I was so anxious, and was
very pleased of the amount of things that were [displaced]. But when you have
some background knowledge, you see things which the general public doesn’t
realize.

Q: Emotionally, psychologically, how was it to see?

A: Well, as I told you, I saw that—- They have me assigned sometimes to be what they
call a roving person up there, to help people understand. And I hardly ever get
asked a question. And wear uniforms so they recognize us right away. And there
were certain exhibits in there, for example, the medical experiment. That’s pretty
graphic. And I’m very sad that they take their 5-year-old kids up there and— But
that’s for me to decide; that each mother must decide that for themselves. So the-
the exhibit is actually, as a whole excellent.

Q: But for you, how was it to see that footage, to see those things?

A: It brought back very bad memory. But you know, it’s funny. The years which
were in between the event which you saw and my life today are so vast, at 60

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 30
years, that the impact were no longer what it should have been. Had I gone in
1948 or ’49, and seen this, I would have probably gone home and haven’t slept
all— wouldn’t sleep all night. But time is a very wonderful factor, which in my life
reduces the impact, through the sense that you see the picture, you remember it,
but it’s— I remember the people, or my family who died, but I didn’t go home and
cry. I said, ““That’s— It’s over, it’s finished, it’s gone. I’m glad we have that
exhibit.” But it did not cause me to be particularly depressed. No, it didn’t. It was
more or less a factual thing, but— an historical thing, but it did not depress me
personally. Now, maybe that’s cold-blooded, but it’s the truth.

Q: We read about one survivor who is still not able to go in and look at the footage.

A: Well, he’s not the only one. I mean, there are survivors— For example, the other
day we had a meeting, and there was one lady [said] who was born in Germany.
She hasn’t been back to Germany at all. She would do anything, go around
Germany if she wanted to go to Austria or someplace, you know, or some other
place. But she felt very strongly. In fact, I got into an argument with her, because
I go back. And [she said], “Aren’t you ashamed to go back to the very people who
persecute you?” And remember what I said. I don’t hold the current generation
responsible. But the impact for me is not— In a sense, it’s mental, if you will, at
all. But it is not so that I have a reaction and don’t sleep at night. It’s not there. I
mean, it’s part of my life which 1s over. It’s finished. I survived it with the grace
of God. He made me live, and then I see the exhibit, I remember the incidents, but
I go home and sleep. I don’t have any more problems like that.

[Tape 13]

Q: At the museum, was that the first time you saw archival footage of the Holocaust?
If not, when was the first time?

A: Well, the first time was probably right after the war.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 31

Q: The first time what?

A: The first time when I noticed footage of the museum was right after the war, when
they had newsreels. A lot of people no longer know what newsreels are. (you
know) They were shown in movies-houses before the film. So we saw them
already when the first moviehouses were opened up in Berlin; or I would say the
war was over in May, and by June and July, they had the first moviehouses, and
there were newsreels. They were usually French or American or British
newsreels. But there they showed the concentration camps and things like that. So
that was my first experience to know about the vast outgrowth of the Nazis’
criminal activities. Because we on— we knew about our own personal life, and not
much else, that there were hundreds of concentration camps with zillions of
prisoners, and they are not just Jews. I mean, everybody else they didn’t like.
That, we found out— I found out at least the first time in about 1945, before I went
to America, when we went to a— when I went to a movie, my mother and I, and
we saw these newsreels, which were quite drastic. (you know) Eisenhower did an
excellent job to bring a film crew over from Hollywood to film the things in ....
concentration camp. So we knew. We knew.

Q: How was that for you, that first time?

A: The first time, was going on my knees and thanking the good Lord that I was
sitting in that moviehouse, that I survived this. I mean, when you see all the death
and starvation around you, and here I was sitting relatively healthy, with my
mother, and having survived all of this, it was just grateful. You know the old
saying, “Here but for the grace of God go I’? That was my feeling.

Q: Were you stunned that you had been able to survive?

A: Yes. [Jn the scale of things— yes.| I was able to be very surprised. But my survival
is really a story within a story itself. But in answer to your question, yes. I was not
at all sure. In other words, if I may say that if my mother hadn’t married my

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 32
stepfather, I would not be sitting here, because he was one of those protected
people because he was an officer, and a decorated one, in World War I, and the
Nazis in their conference in-in 19— January of 1942, decided that those people
would not be gassed. They would be starved to death if at all possible, but they
wouldn’t be gassed. And that was my survival. So I was not— I was surprised
much more to that story I just told you. But the idea was that gratefulness that I
survived, and the reason I survived was the marriage of my mother to my
stepfather.

Q: Were there other aspect of your own personality or abilities that also made it
possible for you to survive?

A: Well, the answer is— I was able to survive because I wanted to survive. Now, that
wasn’t just will power. That was a lot of luck with it. For example— and give you
two examples.

In Theresienstadt, I was— after having horrible jobs before, I was able to get a
job in the kitchen. Now, this kitchen took care of 6,000 people. The food wasn’t
very good, but it was available for those who worked in there. So I was able to get
that. So I- that was way-way step number one.

And then I— to— In order to save my parents, my stepfather, my mother from
possible evacuation, I volunteered to go to a subcamp of Theresienstadt where
they promised that I would save my parents’ life. And I did. And the Nazis, for
whatever reason, kept that promise. They did not evacuate the people—
Theresienstadt, you see, was overcrowded, and the Nazis sent one train after
another right from there to the gas chambers.

Q: You had some faith that the Nazis would honor their word?

A: No, I did not. That is hindsight. That is pure hindsight. They promised that if we-
we would volunteer to go to that subcamp, they would not evacuate our children.
And evacuation meant death, plain, pure and simple. Resettlement, it was called.
So I did it, I volunteered, in the hope that they would— I was not at all convinced.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 33
Not at all. And I had no faith in any Nazi promise. None. And so I said, I have
nothing to lose. Either we’re going to be resettled anyway, because overcrowded,
or I have a fighting chance, if I go and suffer, perhaps they will let them remain
there until we-we-— I use the word “liberation,” which we didn’t know at the time
when [that] happened. Yes. I had no faith in it. I just hoping for the best and
hoping that the good Lord would protect them while I’m gone.

Q: How important was your own youthfulness in your survival?

A: My youthfulness was instrumental. In order to understand that— the answer, one
has to know something about Theresienstadt. As far as German Jews are
concerned, the Nazis only transported three groups of Germans. First of all, the
majority were old people, old people. The Nazis literally, in their conference in
Wannsee, in the protocols you will read: We don’t need to gas them. We’re just
going to starve them to death, and they’re going to— they’re old and feeble. No
use to wasting time, money and trains with them. They’re going to die. So that
was one group. The other group were the mixed, the younger people, were those
of mixed marriages. And a third group were the one of decorated officers, the
families of decorated World War I officers. So that it didn’t surprise me because I
knew that that’s the only reason we were sent there, is because of my stepfather’s
achievement during World War I. And so I had hope [to survive].

And my youth helped me to master this. You cannot really understand it until
one knows about. Theresienstadt was a very difficult thing. It was “Hitler’s gift to
the Jews,” so it was by no means as bad as some of the concentration camp that
had gas chambers and so forth, and—or Auschwitz, where they worked people to
death. We were not worked to death. We starved to death if possible. And the
atmosphere there was different. It was not as bad, I would be lying if I say that,
although it was bad enough as it was. And the— My youth enabled me, among all
these old people, to be something different, which the-the administration of the
ghetto made use of. They were— As far as German Jews are concerned, there were
not that many young people. They were mostly old.

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 34
Now, the camp was dominated by Czechoslovakia Jews. Okay? And they had
a lot of young people in there. They ran the camp, inside, other than the Nazis.
And so my youth helped me considerably.

Q: Did it become an informing factor in your life, a sense that things could always be
worse?

A: That’s definitely true. That’s definitely true. Things could all— The thought that
things could be worse 1s a very obvious one, because all you had to do was look
around you. You see people who were just as nice, just as pleasant, just as
intelligent, just as— you name it, and they were suffering more than I did, for
whatever reasons. And— There was a lot of illness and sickness, and no-no doctors
and no medicine. So obviously things could always be worse. And you knew that.
And you-you thanked the good Lord each morning that you were still alive,
because you didn’t know how you would be in the evening. And so that-that was
feeling which was definitely there. You never knew, and—

Now, a ghetto is a breeding ground for rumors. I mean, rumors left, right, and
down the middle. Everybody knew something from somebody, about somebody.
(you know) And so you hear all these rumors, and some of them were pretty
terrible. So you said, “My God, that can happen to me.” Was a story about a
young man being arrested by the Gestapo in Theresienstadt, and they had a
special area where they had jails and [every-] they beat up people. And he was
sent there, or he was taken there, I should say. And-and everybody knew about it.
Turned out to be, it wasn’t even true. But the stories were going around with that.
And so you knew things could be worse, could be a lot worse.

Q: Did you carry that for the rest of your life?

A: Did that come a perspective? You know, I try to tell myself that. (you know)
When I— When I start complaining about my life today, or yesterday or the day
before, and saying, “Oh my gosh, this didn’t work,” or “That is not right,” and so
forth, then sometimes you have to remember, it could always be worse. (you

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 35
know) There’s always something which could be worse. That has sort of
governed my life ethically (you know) and so forth. It didn’t make me change
things or what, but it made me accept something and saying, “Well, it may
[be/me] worse and it could be— could be worse. (you know) I’m still walking. I’m
still here. I’m in decent health. (you know) And those are our presents which I
got.” But the thought that things can be worse, you don’t have to be Jewish for
that. I mean, that’s sort of universal. Anybody who has any feeling at all, and is
not a complainer by nature, will know that things can be worse. And I was no
different.

Q: What role did luck play in your survival, and how did that shape you later in life?

A: I— If I look back at my life, at the 85 years that I lived, I’ve been very lucky. I’ve
always been very lucky and I can— and I attribute that simply not because of lucky
per see, I think. Some higher power held its hand over me. I mean, (you know)
I’m not a very religious person, and I don’t even give a— give it a name, but there
is a higher power which sort of protected me. Because I was very— several times
near to be dying. There was a time in the end of 1944 where I wanted to die. I'd
finally given up. And God sent me a sign that He didn’t want me to die. And if
you’re interested, I will tell you about it, but 1t changed me and so I felt that I’ve
been very lucky.

Q: First, what happened that you gave up?

A: Okay. Where to start? Briefly, the subcamp of Theresienstadt was— not built,
because there wasn’t much to build. It was— It came into existence because one of
the highest leader of the SS lost his headquarters. It was bombed to pieces. And of
course no respectable SS general could live without a headquarters. So he selected
a piece of land which 1s now near the Polish border, and decided to have a new
headquarters. And I volunteered to go there. And the time there was terrible. It
was the worst time in all these time, this— We went there in— I think I went in late
43, and stayed there for almost a year and a half, if I remember correctly. And it

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 36
was— We had an SS lieutenant colonel who was absolutely the most cruel guy.
And he would not give us— And what happened towards the end of 1944, I got
very ill. I got very ill. I had something which was called impetigo, which is a
vitamin deficiency disease where you have big blotches all over your body, who
seep all the time. You have a high temperature, and— You need to also remember
that we were cut off from all news. We did not know anything about assassination
of Hitler, attempt to assassinate him. We didn’t know where the troops were. We
didn’t know nothing. We had no newspaper, no radio. Nobody was allowed to tell
us anything.

And then we saw a sign. And the sign was the refugees fleeing from the

Russians, coming by the camp in droves. And we thought, well, if they’re fleeing,
then the war must be pretty much going towards an end. And it did. And so that
was a sign which we saw, which-which I said, “No, I don’t want to die. I want— I
want to— It must be coming to an end. It looks’— We had no hard facts. I had no
idea where the Russian army was standing, and so forth. But the German fleeing
west was an indication, they must have had a reason. And the only reason they
could have had was the Soviet army which (g) was approaching Germany. And so
it gave me new hope to say, “I don’t want to die. I want— I want to try to stay
alive,” even though I felt terrible. I had no hope left, I had no strength, nothing.

Q: Is that survival instinct in us? Is it primal, or does it vary from person to person?

A: No, for me the instinct to survive is probably primal. Survival doesn’t always
mean exactly dying or living. (you know) Survival can also mean different phases
of your life. (you know) You want to help your family, you want to be able to pay
college for the kids, and make them into decent human being. That’s part of the
survival. And to me, that’s primal. I mean, that is not acquired or anything. That’s
there. Having survived myself, I wanted to do that for my family and anybody
else I could possibly do it for. So it’s definitely primal.

Q: Would you consider yourself an optimistic person?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 37

A: Would I consider myself an optimistic-optimistic person? That’s 100% yes. I’m
basically an optimist. I always believe that somehow the Lord has protected me
until now, he will do it in the future, and— Look what I got. I’m healthy. I’m 85
years and healthy. And if you don’t feel optimism about that fact, all the money in
the bank isn’t going to help you if you’re sick. So the fact that ’ve got my health,
and can do things like sitting here with you and answering your questions, that is
a reason for optimism, that is a reason for survival, that is a positive indicator that
I should continue my life as best I can.

Q: In your adult life, have you ever had periods of despair or depression?

A: Yes. I-I-I had— I had my ups and downs in my employment. And there was one
incident where the government has its own methodology of reducing people. They
have a bumping system. The seniority bumps lesser seniority, bumps lesser
seniority. And I found myself suddenly out of a job, from one day to the other. I
was terribly depressed, because with the— with the experience and knowledge I
have, it was very difficult to find a job. And I was— That was one of my greatest
depression time when I was very, very sad. And I had a heart attack several years
ago, and did not— You never know how that thing 1s going to go out, and I did
[that], survived that one. So yes. There are periods in my life where you begin to
doubt, when I had experiences which were primarily— not life-threatening
necessarily. A heart attack can be. But the one I’m thinking about, the loss of a
job, I took that very hard, because I worked hard, and it is not a person who fired
me; it was a system which pushed you down. (you know) And that’s something
hard to accept.

Q: And how did you get through that?

A: Well, again, I was very lucky. They found another job for me, which was equal
almost in pay as the one I'd lost, and they said, “You’re just what we’re looking
for, we’ll give you that job,” and there was— All of a sudden my immediate

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 38
problem to earn enough money for my family was gone. It was gone. So whatever
that is. Fate, God, you name it.

Q: And the job issue. . . [inaudible]

A: Ambition. Ambition which I mentioned before. I was a very ambition person.
And .. that is, if you are vice-president of a company, and certainly you— they tell
you, “You can stay in a company, got to be a mail clerk,” well, you’re still with
the company, you earn much less money, you lose all your prestige, you lose your
window in-in the building, which probably only one. So that’s-that’s a
tremendous impact, on me at least. And again I was able to overcome. But the
reason I overcame it is pure luck. Pure luck, and the fact that I had a decent
reputation, that people wanted me.

Q: When did you retire and what did that mean for you?

A: That was a very difficult decision, and I’m still angry with my wife. When-when I
had 39 years, and I was— in 1988, she told me that it’s time to retire. She wants
something of me. Now, this sentence you need to understand. I think very early in
our discussion I told you that I was married more to my work than to my actual
family. It’s not something I’m very proud of it, but that’s my nature. I wanted to—
Ambition drove me. So my wife was very much alone. I traveled all over the
world, I was always gone, I was barely home when my children were born,
because the Air Force sent me someplace. And so the idea that— (I’m sorry, I lost
the thread.)

Q: Your wife wanted you to retire.

A: Yeah. I— My wife wanted me to retire, and I figured I owe her. I owe her that— to
spend some time with her, more time, more present time. Was a great big mistake.
My daughter warned me, because I wasn’t ready to retire. All of a sudden you sit
at home. And the next day you sit at home. And the phone rings, and it isn’t for

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 39
you. And then the phone rings again. It still isn’t for you. While you’re used to
getting, “Mr. Behr, the phone is for you,” (you know) no more. It was for my
wife. And you feel an emptiness creeping into your— into your [mind/life]. It did
in my case. I had a real emptiness which-which I— no matter how hard I fought it.
So I looked for a job. I was still in Dayton, Ohio, and I found one for a contractor
where I worked for a year until they closed shop. And that kept me going for a
while. (you know) And then I taught school, which kept me going, which was
constructive, was something I loved to do. And so it wasn’t for the— certainly for
the money, because they don’t pay-pay those schoolteachers, adjunct teachers
very much. But it—- My retirement was much too early. I was full of energy, I was
full of interest, I loved my job. I should have never listened. I should have worked
a few more years, until I would say I’m ready to retire. And— But I felt guilty. I
really felt guilty, and I thought I owe my family some time of myself, not job
number one, job number two, and then thirdly comes my family. So.

Q: How long ago was that?

A: 88. So I was (what) 66.

Q: And then what. Did you get used to it? Did you do something else?

A: Well, I-I had no problem very much because I worked for a contractor, and then
I— then I taught school. When I really felt the impact, when we moved here, to
Washington DC. I tried to find a position where—which I can teach again, like an
adjunct teacher. I tried to find a part-time job. But with the experience I had, that
isn’t very easy. (you know) That’s not a profession you can say, “He’s an
industrial engineer,” or— Who wants a broken down, old intelligence officer? I
mean, it’s— I mean that seriously. It is not something where the demand is very
high, unless you have a technical background to go with it—that’s fine—which I
didn’t have.

Q: Is that ultimately what led you to volunteer at the museum?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 40

A: Yes. Precisely. I volunteer (A) at the museum and (B) at the local hospital. I work
there one day a week, in-in the emergency room, and-and that-that led me to the
volunteer jobs I have. Because they were the only ones I could find without any— I
had no difficulty finding volunteer jobs. I liked them, and I stuck with it.

Q: Did the work in the museum give you a new sense of identity and purpose?

A: Definitely. Yes. The-the-the museum is basically very good with volunteers. They
appreciate it, especially to survivor volunteers, which are not that many left. And
the-the museum in fact restored to me some degree of pride, that I contribute
something .. to my own life as well as to other people. For example, on my jacket
I have a two little signs that I speak German and I speak French. And people
come up to you and say, “Can you help me? I-I don’t speak English.” (you know)
And so you really have a sense of fulfillment. The museum has furthermore
discovered that I’m a fairly decent speaker, and sent me out on various trips
throughout the United States to talk to children about—or adults, for that
matter—about the Holocaust, my own personal experience therein. So yes.
Definitely it has.

[Tape 14]

Q: What kind of racism did you see in America when you came here?

A: That’s a nice question. What did I see about [preyudism] and so forth? Well, first
thing was, remember, I wound up in Dallas? And about— I don’t know whether it
was a week later or ten later, I got an anonymous letter which was vicious, to say
the least, that— to get myself back home, and used a lot of four-letter words. “We
don’t want you here. You have no business being here.” That was my first
introduction to thing. And then slowly I began to learn that there is a hidden
language among Americans, which has distinct meaning as far as discrimination
is concerned. I think I mentioned already “Christian church nearby.” There were

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 41
ideas of— that rent restrictions against Jews. (you know) People told me that. I
hadn’t actually seen this. And there was a certain degree of discrimination.

Now, one of the stranger types of discrimination is that I was very careful to
say to somebody, “I’m from Germany.” (you know) Now, without explaining
between Jewish and Germans and all that, you had to be very careful. And I
happily lied about it and told everybody I was from Switzerland, who didn’t have
a need to know. German had of course Swe— They speak German up there. And
they all accepted it. That was great.

But the war was just over. Thousands of Americans died. Very many had
hard feelings, and sometimes even against the Japanese, but that were— they were
Germany’s allies and so forth. So you got to learn this in your experience. (you
know) Because what was I to say? “Who are you? What’s your nationality?” I
remember that sentence. Nationality or some didn’t mean anything to me in that
sense. I learned what people expect to hear then. So what do you say? You’re
German? That’s not acceptable. You’re Jewish? That was against my grain, to
advertise that I’m Jewish. So that posed a very difficult question, and I solved it
by just escaping it and saying I’m Swiss. So everything was fine. The Swiss were
neutrals, nobody hated them, nobody loved them, so there was no problem at all.
But I did indeed live through that period, until I got in the military. And then it
stopped. (you know) The military in this particular way, (the) whatever their
personal feelings may have been, there was nothing [personal].

Q: You were in America for the civil rights movement, McCarthy era, Cold War,
Vietnam War, women’s movement, etc. Any reactions to those?

A: Well, the one which got my most attention was the black— the attitude towards
black. The— I was— I mean, when I heard in— that in the South they had segregated
buses, of course it reminded me of everything. When I heard that they had water
fountains for blacks, water fountains for whites, and everything what I
experienced to some degree from— directed against myself and my own people, I
all of a sudden saw that. And it gave me a great shock. You know. I heard people

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 42
talking in Texas, not very flattering about black people, and of course that raised
very many memories. And remember that I said I was always worried—

Q: Start again. And remember—

A: I remember that the Holocaust was very, very much on my mind, and I thought:
How can these people do that? And in 1947, when I first got to America, it was no
longer— or not yet anyway, as much as it became later on, until 1954, when the
schools got integrated and so forth, some of this separation based strictly on color.
And I was really shocked. And I never heard much about it because the Germans
didn’t report that so much and— at least not to what I was aware of. And so this
attitude was, from that point of view, a real shock to me.

What was not a shock later on was the war you mentioned, the Vietnam War,
the Korean War. Those were things I could accept. I mean, that’s to me quite—
Not necessarily agree with it, but I understand where we came from, and I
understand what we’re trying to do. So that did not provide— Maybe a little degree
of sadness that people had to die again, but it did not come as a surprise, and I
thought that 1t was [America]. But the attitudes towards minorities was a real
shock to me, because I thought: Didn’t the— Didn’t the world learn a lesson, (you
know) what happened? And obviously it took a while before they learned that
lesson.

Q: Did it undermine your own sense of security and safety in America?

A: The answer was, to some degree, yes. I mean, I thought, well, if they treat their-
their minorities that way, what hap— what would prevent them to next day to treat
the Jewish minority (which is a minority, even though they don’t look like one)
the same way? And I had no one to talk to about it. See, I didn’t— That 1s a subject
which in-in Texas you just didn’t bring up with people you didn’t know very well.
And I didn’t know anybody very well. And so I held that back. I ate this into
myself, which made me sad. I mean, I cannot even use anything— not even angry.
It made me just sad, and question that a country which I admired so much would

do those things. (you know) And having experienced so much myself, I felt that
this was dead wrong.

Q: Did you get politically active in it?

A: No. I did not get reactive, other than my personal attitude towards minorities. My
first job was with minority people in a factory, and I treated them as courteous,
and I was looked at sort of by the other white people, when I sat next to for lunch
to a— to a (as they call it then) colored person, and I was looked at and they-they
did not approve of that. And you felt that and— But I got unhappy because I
thought that 1s so wrong, and I’m going to demonstrate that where I come from, a
person is a person, regardless of its appearance. In my little own way, I did that. I
also did it in the military, where there were blacks and lots of Latinos in those
days. So, yes.

Q: Your thoughts on immigration, and the relationship between immigrants and
minorities in America?

A: I’m just as puzzled as most Americans are of what to do about immigration. I
immigrated with all the legal requirements fulfilled: applying for a visa, filling out
questionnaires, getting interviewed by the consul, you know, and I do not really
condone the idea that we have millions of illegal immigrants here who just
sneaked across a border, and here they are. And basically I am not for an amnesty.
But that’s one side of my brain. On the other side of my brain says: My God, what
are we going to do with 12 million people? We can’t send them all back. They’re
needed here. They pay taxes. They-they are honest. They— We have them here
where I live. All-all the physical labor practically is done by Latinos. And they’re
very honest, they’re very nice. I have not seen anybody being— So I don’t have a
good answer. I really do not have a good answer. Neither does Congress, and
that’s why we are in that mess, because we don’t know really how to get out of it.

Q: Are you skeptical that the immigration issue can be xenophobia as well?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 44

A: I don’t think so. I really do not believe that’s the case. I think that people, decent
people are honestly wrestling with that question. How did we let them in? Well,
we didn’t let them in. They came in. And so we’re now facing a fact that— I think
that most Americans I am in contact with would like to find a very decent answer
to the question of what to do. On-on the one hand, you don’t want to reward them.
(you know) You know all that. And-and on the other hand, you don’t want to kick
them out either. So basically my instinct was, they should come in here legally.
But send them all back and have them all apply for a visa, takes longer than I will
have— 12 million people. So I don’t have— If I had— If I had to make a decision, I
would find a way to keep them here, and legalize them, whatever methods is it.
And I wish that Congress would have agreed to the proposal the Bush
administration made to keep them here and allow them to stay, and legalize them
to the degree that they don’t get expelled. (you know) Maybe apply for a visa
while they’re here, while that visa is pending. (you know) And so that is what I
would do. I would say, you can stay but you need to apply for a visa, you need to
pay for it, and while-while that is working, you can stay here. And many of the
Latino families have American children. They were born here.

Q: What generally are your thoughts on Affirmative Action?

A: Oh, like I told you before when I talked about Dallas, Texas, and the experience I
had, how they treated me, [Affirmative] Action to me is justified. I mean, under
certain conditions, but basically and overall, to give a minority who has been
suffered a privilege to be accepted by eliminating certain conditions which would
have handicapped them, I’m all in favor for it.

Q: Is there inevitably some lasting identification with those who are marginalized or
discriminated against?

A: Well, it’s theoretical. It’s not a practical thing anymore, but it’s theoretical. I’m an
immigrant. I came from a foreign country. Ill give you an example. What deeply
bothers me (and that’s in answer to your question) is when people come to this

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 45
country and don’t learn English. I mean, when I came to this country, my English
was nowhere near what it is now. And one of my first ideas was, you’ve got to
learn the language. I did everything in my power to become fluent in English.
And I noticed that some of the immigrants do not make that determined attempt to
learn German. I get— To learn English (excuse me). I work in a hospital, and I see
foreign families, whether Latinos or Asiatics, come in, and a 6-year-old kid comes
and does the interpreting. “My mother has pain in her right leg.” She doesn’t— She
cannot say it. She’s been here for years but she still cannot say it. She uses her
child. Makes me very unhappy. I mean, I would have— But if my idea would be
prevailing, and these people can stay, [1t’s] under one condition: you must learn
English. Age is no excuse.

Q: Why is that so important to you?

A: If you want to integrate yourself in a society, in my opinion, number one priority
is to communicate. And if you don’t speak the language, you cannot
communicate. Communications, whether it’s a marriage or [adaptation] in a
country, 1s of tremendous important to learn the society in which you wish to live,
or the marriage in which to live. You’ve got to communicate. And unless you
learn the language, you can’t communicate. It’s no use to read Spanish or French
newspapers: would tell you what’s going on, but you cannot even verbalize it in-
in English. And that’s wrong.

Q: Are there political issues that you do feel strongly about?

A: Can I drop the political aspect? I don’t want to really answer that one, (you know)
because there are, and I don’t want to talk about that. I will gladly talk about
social issues.

Q: Okay.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 46

A: And as far as social issues are concerned, they concern me very gravely. For
example, factors which have nothing to do with the Holocaust is health insurance.
Now, in Germany health insurance mandatory. You pay a lot of taxes, you accept
it, but it’s mandatory. Everybody’s got health insurance. I grew up in that society,
notwithstanding the Nazis, that everybody had health insurance. And to have a
country which struggles with the idea to give health insurance to
everybody—we’re struggling with this, we have discussions about it—that
shouldn’t be. We should only discuss how we can do it, not why we can do it or
whether we should do it. (you know) And so those are [the] troubling issue which
I— which I really have.

And I see strata of societies which are vastly different, from the very poor
through the very rich. We do have a middle class, no question about it, but it’s not
easy to work your way up if you’re in a poor strata, to join the middle class. Not
easy at all. Education is a major factor in that. And the opportunities are there for
education, but again, if you don’t speak the language, you can’t use it.

Q: Death penalty? Any thoughts?

A: Well, I’m basically against the death penalty. But then I need to look at my past.
If the Allies hung the people at Nuremberg, did I feel bad about it? Not for one
second. In fact, I would have helped them string them up if I had to. But then you
mellow. (you know) There was a hatred of those people who were instrumental in
killing us, whether 1t was Hermann Goering or Ribbentrop of whoever it was. I
had no pity for them. I had no pity for the other people who were condemned to—
Not some of the people who were at Nuremberg. And there were a number of
trials [and] people. So that death penalty went away.

And I still, in my own mind, struggle. Where do you draw the line with-with
where you support the death penalty, where you stop? When you read something
about brutal murders and so forth— Basically I would in all circumstances avoid it
if at all possible, because life in prison without parole can be .. worse than the
death penalty sometimes. (you know)

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 47

Q: But you understand the impulse for the call for it?

A: Oh, I understand the impulse why we have a death penalty. Should we do away
with the death penalty? Would there be a vote, and a nationwide vote which you
can answer as yes or no? Do away with it or not? I would probably vote: do away
with it. (you know) But again, these are very personal feelings, and you can hold
any number of arguments against it. (you know) People do very brutal things and
totally unnecessary things out of vicious ideas and— Why should these people live
so they kill more people? (you know) But—

Q: At 85, you’re very healthy, but you’ve already witnessed death. Do you feel any
more or less prepare in terms of your own mortality? Has it impacted your
thoughts on death and loss?

A: Yes. (you know) Every once in a while, and more-— less “once” and more “while,”
Pll keep thinking: your day will come. I do think sometimes about dying. And it
immediately reflects my thought: What would happen to my wife if I die? What—
My children can manage. But my wife needs me, and I know that. And it is that
thought; it is not my own existence. Is my lack of opportunity to support my wife,
to help my wife— And I do a lot of things for her, as she does for me. But any time
I think about dying (which is inevitable; it’s going to come), and— What would it
do to my wife? (you know) What would it leave her with problems and concerns
and worries and things I’ve been taking care of all my life? So the thought is very
definitely there. And as each (1) year clicks by, it comes to just a little more vivid.
(you know) I’m thankful that I’m healthy, I hope to have a few more years, but
the thought 1s never from— completely from my mind.

Q: Is there any fear?

A: Not so far. So far, it’s been so that I— I cannot even envision. I mean, I’m not
afraid of death. I tell myself, as long as I can die quickly. I-I’m very afraid of a
lingering illness, where the quality of life diminishes so that you depend on other

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 48
people, that you are no longer able to take care of yourself. That’s what I fear
really more than death itself.

Q: Have you done your healthcare proxies and DNRs?

A: I’ve done as much as I possibly can. I exercise as much as you can in my age, and
I do it regularly. I watch what I eat, and— I must confess that I smoke a pipe, and I
still do, and it’s either my toothbrush or my pipe, and I don’t [going] to give up
both of them. So I do as much as I can to stay well. (you know) The rest is up to
my higher power, and there’s not much I can do. I do what is in my power to-to-to
stay well. But whatever— What life has in store for you, you need to accept, (you
know) even if it’s difficult.

Q: Had you had any experience with death before the Holocaust?

A: Oh, my grandfather died. I had a personal tragedy and— Not very much so, I must
say that— But I did have death, and I knew that people were dying and I’d been to
some (what they call) your viewing, you know. So you see the person you just
used to know shortly before as being a vivid person, lying up there. But basically,
in my young age and until the war started, .. that I was somewhat removed from
death, because we didn’t— I didn’t have a large family. And so we— I heard a lot
[about] rel- relatives who died, but personally experiencing [that they suddenly]
was very seldom.

Q: But during the war?

A: Well, during the war it changed completely. A human life was nothing. In
Theresienstadt, my first job was to collect dead bodies. I mean, if anybody ever
seen piles of dead bodies, I mean, not in a newsreel, not on television, but people
who are [ruthlessly] put on top of each other, and people who died from
starvation, are not very pretty to look at. Is nowhere near what a viewing looks
here, where people are embalmed and look very nice and have good clothing on.

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 49
People I saw die or dead were nothing more than a piece of (I can’t say human) a
former human being, which I had to carry in a wagon outside the city to be
burned. (you know) So what you do, you lose all respect for death. You lose all
empathy and you— You only care how heavy is the body, because I got to lift it.
And so what you see in movies sometimes, or in theaters, or read in books, death
became ugly, even though you had nothing to do with the killing; but under the
condition we lived in, the-the—

Theresienstadt city was a city which had about 4,000 inhabitants, not
counting the military. They crammed 60,000 people in there. Now, just imagine
this. People died. They didn’t even have room to die sometimes. And that was
bad. It was really, really very bad. And the— your— You were supposed to treat
death respectful. You know? Respectful of the person who lived and achieved his
duty, all gone. Survival and everything else wasn’t important. And if it meant
carrying dead bodies outside the city, you just did it. It was just another job.
That’s all. But compassion, sadness, pity, to be very honest with you, all gone. All
gone. There was nothing. My heart was cold towards the dead body. My emotions
were dead, and I am nowhere near where you can glorify the-the person’s death
and remember only the good things and all the— I didn’t know most of them. They
were dead. They were just other prisoners.

Q: And now?

A: Well, the answer I can give you: I didn’t have a death, since in my family I-I had
not— I had a cousin who died, who was very ill, for him— for whom death was
probably a relief. And he was in a home, and so that was good. And that’s all I
had. All my other relatives were gassed. They were gone. And you ask now, but
see, that’s only memory.

Q: And your mom? Did she die after?

A: My mom died in 1949, and she had cancer, and it was sad. But her quality of life
had diminished very much after all those years in a camp, and so I took it. She

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 50
was fairly young. She was only 51 years old. And it made me feel more sad. I felt
like almost I neglected her. (you know) I should have done something to keep her
alive. (you know) And of course it wasn’t possible, and so it’s— It’s a milestone in
my life, but it’s gone. It’s over. It’s finished. I don’t like to dwell on it.

Q: Having your mother there, and being almost responsible for your mother—

A: Oh, definitely.

Q: What dimension did that add to your own experience in the Holocaust?

A: What the dimension is? That I nearly prostituted myself, meaning that I did
everything to get some food for my mother. There was only one place where you
can get food: in the kitchen, in the ghetto kitchen which cooked for all the
thousands of people. There were several of them. And I needed to get in there
because my mother was going—my stepfather as well—they were rapidly going
down with the food they were having. It was never enough. And I finally did
something which is difficult to describe. I-I became friends with a Czech man
who was already in a kitchen. (you know) And the relationship between Czechs
and Germans was not good. And these were both prisoners. That is like in today’s
prison where you have gangs. I mean, if you— 1f you expand that, you had one
group of German Jews and you had one group of Czech Jews. The Czech Jews
ran the ghetto, no question, more or less very well. They had of course all the
good positions, one of which being— There were several of them. One, you could
be a Jewish policeman, and you could be working in a kitchen. That was all
Czechs. And I sa— I-I met the guy and I wined and dined him in that— but not
literally, but I sort of— For example, the Czechs always believed the German Jews
helped get Hitler elected. We didn’t stand up. Oh God, we had arguments. We did
not stand up to the Germans when Hitler tried to become chancellor, and they
blamed us. It was our fault that Hitler ever came to power, and that they are now—
have an occupied country, and they are sitting in a concentration camp. So I began
to admit this. I said, “Yeah, we could have done more.” And that was strictly a

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 14 ROBERT BEHR page 51
psychological attempt to get this guy’s friendship. And sure enough, we became
sort of— not friends but acquaintances. He liked me, he was older than I am, and
he was a chief of one of the kitchen. And finally I told him, I said, “Look, I would
love to work in a kitchen for you.” I didn’t want to work for him at all, but I told
him. And so I sort of pros— myself, prostituted myself mentally by saying things
which I really didn’t mean. And I got the job. I was in a kitchen, and I could take
some food home for my parents. Not legally. That was strictly forbidden. But we
managed. And I was able to save my mother’s life by that. (you know) So.

[Tape 15]

Q: When did the reaction of the American Jewish community to Holocaust survivors
change?

A: Well, it did change. But I- What I’m going to give you as an answer is a very
personal opinion. I mean, there may be historians who will violently disagree with
it. So be it. But my opinion is that the whole relationship between the Christian
world and the Jewish world in America changed drastically due to the Six Day
War in Israel against the Arab states. Those enormous unexpected visit—victory in
six days, where the Israeli army defeated Egypt and Jordan and Syria and came
out completely as a victory, suddenly put Israel on the map like never before, with
the possible except of 1948, when the-the United Nations allowed Israel to exist.
Not ever since that time was Israel suddenly in the minds of so many people.
Suddenly there was a little tiny country with a bunch of refugees who resettled,
and they beat the hell out of— out of the vastly superior (numerically at least)
nations. And I almost felt that the attitude of the Americans began to change.
There was a certain degree of respect. May not be love and admiration, but
admiration did play in it. They said, “My God, look at those guys.” You know,
Moshe Dayan with his black eye patch. You remember that? These became
heroes, folk heroes. And Americans are very attuned to people who do good-— do-
do brave and good things, and become their— Americans are not ignoring this.
[They never say], “Eh, what’— No. Americans admire this. And suddenly there is

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 52
this tiny little state which is in everybody’s mouth. And-and Israel began to get
admired. And I think that a lot had to do with the change of attitude, even
politically. I mean, our government supports Israel, (you know) and-and
financially, militarily, and commercial— economically. So this was did something
which none of us could have ever achieved without it. That was a past. That was
gone. [You ....] here. So forget the Holocaust. That’s fine. You’re here now, and
now this war. And the victory of that war, in my personal opinion, electrified the
American people. It really did. And from then on, so many things changed of the
political and social and economic and military attitude of the United States
towards Israel. It’s remarkable. And so I think that’s—that was the trigger.

Q: Did you find, after that people were more interested in your story?

A: Yes. All of a sudden .. people— Jewish people were in demand as speakers.
Suddenly, ten years later, we start building a Holocaust museum. (you know) It
put Israel and the Jewish people on the map. And maybe rightly or wrongly, we
were associated. (you know) We were Jewish, and so there were the Jews winning
that war, and even though we didn’t personally fight in it, we supported it, and the
people began to get respect. And that respect it gave towards the Israeli people
transferred itself to some degree to the Jewish communities, not an individual
necessarily, but Jewish organizations, and there was interface between Christian
religions and rabbis and so forth. And so, in my opinion, a whole new, very
favorable association originated from this. Now, again, that’s a very personal
opinion. It’s not from somebody’s writing or anything. That’s just my own
evaluation. So right or wrong, that’s what I believe.

Q: Did you find that more and more people started to identify themselves more fully
as Holocaust survivors?

A: No, I wouldn’t say that. I would say that maybe identify them as Jews. (you
know) There were Jews like me, who never wanted to admit to anybody that they
were Jews. Remember, I told you earlier in our discussion that I would never

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 53
volunteer that I am Jewish. Now all of a sudden it didn’t matter so much.
Somebody said, “Oh, he’s Jewish. He’s related to these guys in Israel who fought
that war.” (you know) And so while there always will be anti-Semitism and there
will always be people, but the general population, in my personal experience, I no
longer hesitated to tell people I’m Jewish. I mean, I really didn’t. And I— while I
don’t volunteer it, but when I’m asked, I don’t hem and haw around it. I said,
“Yes, Iam.” And thinking back of what these guys achieved there made me
proud, because even though I’m not Israeli, but I’m Jewish, and there is a
common bond, see?

Q: Does the state of Israel have any meaning to you?

A: Does it have any idea? I’m very happy it exists. I’m very happy of all the refugees
they took in from Russia and from Ethiopia and all the— all the thing. I think the
Jewish state is something that deserves to be supported by our government, which
it does very well. And it is a stabilizing factor— could have been a stabilizing
factor in the Israeli if they wouldn’t make the mistakes they’re making now about
the occupation. There we go back to the ’67 war. (you know) To me, the war was
over, there would have been a peace treaty, and there would have been this. Little
did I know that you have a fanatic minority in Israel which feels that they have
(quote, unquote) the “right” to occupy Palestinian lands. That I don’t agree with
that at all, (you know) but that’s after the war and it’s hindsight. (you know)

Q: When did you first publicly start to identify and talk about being a Holocaust
survivor?

A: When I joined the museum. That’s the first time [I ever]}- You see—

Q: Put that together as a full idea.

A: I put this together because, you see, “Holocaust survivor” to the average
population doesn’t mean anything. It really— Go to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 54
tell them you’re a Holocaust survivor; maybe [you have] a small group of people
who know exactly what that is. What Holocaust? What did you survive? So there
was not the general acceptance that there was a Holocaust. I mean, it’s being
denied today. But the general ..... was just simply ignored. Didn’t know. And so
my awareness and promotion of the idea came actually when I joined the museum
as a volunteer, where suddenly was emerged (you know) people who did nothing
else but think Jewish. They weren’t even Jewish. They were just working there.
But they promoted the idea and they supported it, they spread it out (you know)
to— the museum was built, and (it) I lost the shyness. Because if I had believed
what I used to, I wouldn’t be sitting here. I really would not be sitting here.
Because to talk about my Jewish experience was not something I ever wanted to
do, until I joined the museum.

Q: How long ago was that?

A: I joined the museum about 4 years ago.

Q: What has that meant to you, to start talking about it?

A: Well, it— It became slowly— not right away. It became slowly a mission, the
mission to spread the idea of the Holocaust. Now, it started out very-very small.
That means you had individual visitors who would ask you a question. (you
know) Sometimes when I was upstairs, they would point to an exhibit and want to
know what that is, and how come. And the museum had special about book
burning, for example, you know. That was a wonderful experience because so
many people were curious about it. And so the idea of being able to promote the
idea is actually what did it when I saw it in the Holocaust museum.

Q: Are you friends with other Holocaust survivors? Was that a world you would
have wanted to fit in?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 55

A: Well, again, I have to be personal. No, I don’t have any friends. I have
acquaintances, but no friends. I told you, I’m a very difficult person to make
friends. And for example, when I volunteer, I know several of them. We never
have any social contact. I don’t have any social contact with them. We are very
friendly and interested when we are in the museum, or when there are common
activities from the museum, but as to a personal relationship (my wife visits your
wife, you know, we get together to go out for dinner), that has not happened. And
again, that is a personal criteria. My wife and I are— you may not believe it, but
we are rather shy. And we do not, especially my— due to my wife’s health, we do
not mingle very— I-I’m not a mingler at all. And— But we-we are, when we are in
the museum, very good colleagues and so forth.

Q: Is there any part of you psychologically that has been unburdened or freed?

A: Yes. I told you. What-what has been— As far as psychologically unburdened, I am
no longer afraid to tell somebody I’m Jewish. I mean, I don’t, I think, tell you, if
somebody says— I would never say, “I’m a Jew.” Never, ever, ever, ever. I would
say, “I’m Jewish.” And the idea is that I find the term (even though it is strictly
personal) “I’m a— I’m a Jew” like something discriminatory. I mean, there-there is
a difference, as you know, maybe understand that, there is a difference in my-— in
my eyes, in my feelings. Other people may think that’s stupid, that’s the same
thing. Well, to me it isn’t. So I’m no longer to say— oh yes. “Are you Jewish,”
somebody would say; I would say yes. Before that, I (would) probably wouldn’t
have said yes. If a stranger asked me, for whatever reason, I would have said no. I
would say I non-denominational.

Q: Do you think a place like a Holocaust museum has a purpose? “Why have one at
all,” some people say.

A: Well, whoever says that has not learned a lesson from history. The museum, like
the Vietnam memorial, like the World War II memorial, the museum is one
demonstration of the honor of a major political event. It isn’t necessarily because

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 56
it happens to be built in America, but there is one in Berlin, there is one in other
cities. They have— The Holocaust Museum has a mission to transmit the idea of
the tragedy of that period. Can you imagine, they had an Armenian museum? I
mean, so many Armenians were killed by the Turks, allegedly, and nobody
honors it. Nothing. I mean, it’s just people who are of Armenian descent who
promote the idea that they were wrongfully accused and murdered. We don’t have
to do this. We got a physical, monumental evidence, where people can go and
visit and learn that— The museum has a fantastic library where you find all sorts of
material if you’re interested. And more and more people come, because it’s there.
It wasn’t there before. Take the Holocaust museum away, and you got to go
through the Library of Congress, you got to work your way through, and to
probably find the same books. But they’re not consolidated, they’re not
linguistically organized. They have people trained there who—Says, “I would like
to do a research on a Ukrainian city, and I need some material.” (you know) You
probably find it in the Library of Congress, but it’s not going to be that easy. And
so the museum has definitely a mission.

Q: Your thoughts about Bosnia, Rwanda, Darfur?

A: Well, it started actually— My-my major reason started with the Cambodian thing
up there under Political Pot, when he killed 2 million people. (you know) And
my-my very sad feeling. And I really mean that. I was hoping that by May of
1945, when our war was finished, the Second World War, that that would be the
end of mass killings. I mean, murder will always happen. But the idea of massing
killings for ethnical— for ethnic reasons or for-for the tribal hatred, like in
Rwanda, I mean Darfur now, which is all tribal, I mean, that’s to me very
disappointed. I did not like the thing in-in Bosnia, and I-I was sort of sad that
Yugoslavia was split up, because you see, it’s funny. As long as Tito was alive, it
was a one country and so on. (you know) And when Saddam Hussein was alive,
that was one country, and no— Now the only guy who murdered was him. And so
then as soon as he was gone, the country fell apart. So I-I don’t know what the

answers 1s. That, you know, we always talk about the international community.
Well, that’s-that a bad term because the international community is you and I and
him and her. You know. So it’s not that we all speak with one voice, even though
we should sometimes, but we don’t.

Q: Has the world changed since the Holocaust, then?

A: I think so. I think the world has changed. The world becomes cognizant. Look of
the effort we’re making to stop the civil war in Darfur. We really make a sincere
effort through the United Nations to stop that war. (you know) The Holocaust
definitely had an impact, except that the impact is limited to some countries and
some small— France right now 1s going through a great wave of anti-Semitism.
And they should know better. And so it’s the idea that as the world learns
something about it, of course they [earn]. Are the listening? That’s something else
again. You know. There’s a great deal of difference between learning and
listening, because if you listen, you feel obligated to do something. Learning, we
learned about Rwanda, and of all the killings, and we didn’t do anything.

Q: Do you think each of us is capable of good and evil, in some way the rest of us
might not understand?

A: The difference— I think— Most people, in my opinion, understand the difference
between good and evil. What my— What some people don’t understand, that in
their mind, in their activities, evil dominates the good things. I don’t know if I say
this right. You have people who kill. I mean, individual. Nothing to do with a
holocaust. But people who murder a pizza delivery man. They know that’s wrong.
But they’re not listening to their conscience. And I do not think that one can ever
change this. Human nature is difficult, and human nature is complex. And to have
suddenly a world where everybody is friendly and amiable and listening and
receptive, that’s a dream. That’s a dream. I don’t think we have it, I don’t think
we ever will. But that’s something which I think we have to live with. And all we
can do is try to minimize the evil and promote the good.

Q: Tell me about your one friend and your relationship.

A: My friend is a gentleman with whom I worked for many years in the Air Force.
And he retired and stayed in— He’s an American, naturalized as I am, from
Germany, and he served in the Air Force with me, and then he married a German
lady and retired in Germany. He lives there now. Got great problems with the
exchange between the US dollars and Euro, but that’s neither here nor there.

He-he’s a good friend of mine because we have very much in common. He
likes history— And the strange part about it that some people cannot understand:
He’s German. He’s not Jewish at all. He’s German. He was drafted during the
war, and he was in the navy, in the German navy for about 5 months before the
war ended. And he is— We often get into a political discussion. I said, “Your
father.” “What about your father (you know) and your grandfather?” (you know)
And he tried to convince me that his grandfather and his fa— his— primarily his
grandfather were— and his father, were not ever Naz— National Socialists. And I
said, “Well, you’re just one of many. There weren’t any.” And so I like his
attitude. He condemns what the Germans did. He literally condemns it, and he
means it. (you know) And we have intellectually an awful lot in common. (you
know) And so he’s the— what my wife calls my favorite Nazi. And he’s of course
German, was in the military and all that, and so we use that nickname. I always
address him as my favorite Nazi. And he hates it. So that’s nice.

Q: Does he have insight about why he was vulnerable to his own participation?

A: No, he was drafted. He was drafted in the mili— towards the end of the war, and
went like everybody else, and was assigned to the navy, and became a cadet, to go
to officers candidate school, and then the war ended already. (you know) But his
whole background is very German, (you know) and proud of it as— His father was
a man with a “von” in the middle, (you know) which means blue-blooded, (you
know) and-and I think he— He never really told me his name was “von Rossbach,”
and he dropped that. (you know) So he dropped the “von” and cut that name out
when you— okay.

Q: When you talk to young people about your experiences, how do you hope it will
change their world views? Or do you think it will?

A: Frankly—

Q: And refer a subject back.

A: I— Will-will my activities change the opinion of the world I talk to? Middle,
young, shall we say, eighth graders on up to graduate students. I hope so. I’m not
convinced that they would physically do something about stopping, but certainly
the seed is there. If they pursue it in any form or shape, in a manner that you read
books about the Holocaust, that they talk to other people about the Holocaust, that
they’re aware of it, then I think the seed is there, and in many instances I think it
will grow. It will never eradicate hate crimes. I don’t think that will ever happen.
But I think that many of them will think, will think and when a disaster strikes,
like killing in one of the African countries for a tribal necessity and so forth, they
will— they will understand better now, since they know what could be the end
result. Six million dead. It starts with maybe, when the Nazis came to power, they
arrested 20 and beat them up. But on the next day, 30. And (you know)
Niemoller’s famous saying. But the-the seed is there. And with any degree of
luck, it will grow. To what dimensions it will grow, I don’t know. I don’t know. I
won’t be around. But that’s one of the reasons the museum, as well as myself, we
hope that the seeds were sown will germinate and grow into something where
people actually said, “We’re not going to do this,” or “We’ll support this in order
to stop that.” (you know)

Q: When you speak, what do people ask you?

A: Ha. That’s a good question. The best question I ever had was from a young kid
and he asked me, “How many people did you ever kill?” And so I told him I-I
wasn’t the killer. I was the victim, not the killer. But the question they ask are
basically the same. First question I usually get is: What did you do when you

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 60
came to America? That’s one of their standard question. The second standard
question is: How do you feel towards the German people? That’s the second
standard question. Okay. Third question 1s: Do you ever went back to Germany?
And do you talk to Germans? And that’s so— the three standard questions. And
they want to know sometimes details about the camp. What did you get to eat?
Where did you sleep? And what— Did you have a tattoo? And so those are pretty
much the standard question. But the first three, they’re almost standard, almost
standard. How do you feel about the Germans, and that sort of thing.

Q: You interrogated Nazis after the war, with the Air Force. Did you feel hatred or
revenge? What happened to that in you?

A: When I first did it in 1947, I very definitely felt that anything we can get them,
they deserve. (you know) Any punishment they can get them. See, I was only a
screener. The formal interrogation— I screened whether the person was in the SS
or wasn’t. He—- The Americans and the British, but I’m sure the Americans,
created a questionnaire where all the Nazi organizations and subdivisions were
listed. And people had to fill those out. So there were some organizations [in it]
were nominally Nazi but they weren’t. Others were. And so my job was to flush
out who did what to whom during the war. And you got to remember that the be-
the worst thing about the thing is that there weren’t any Nazis. That whole
German people unanimously and individually decided, “Me? Never Nazi. Him,
you go to ask.” (you know) And it was terrible. They just absolutely will not say,
“Yeah, I made a mistake. I followed him. I believed in him.” Very seldom did you
find it. You find it in literature. But face to face?

There’s an excellent movie out called Downfall. And that movie is the last
week of Hitler’s life. And it introduces the person who was instrumental in
furnishing the information, which was Hitler’s secretary. Now, she lived with him
day in and day out. In her introduction in that movie, she said she had no idea
what the— what the Nazis did with the Jewish people. She knew that the Nazis
didn’t like them; they knew that they deprived them of work, and-and some

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 61
degree of comfort. But that they actually evacuated them, she knew that too. That
was only to work on road construction or whatever the case may have been. But
that they put them in the death camp by the thousands, she never knew. And now,
you’re going to believe this? She was Hitler’s secretary, [Kristol/Traudl Junge].
And she said that outright in the movie, (you know) after it was [found], and— So
that’s the attitude you’ ll find. “It wasn’t me.”

And then you have mitigating circumstances, if I may say that. Every civil
servant in Germany during the time had to belong to the Nazi Party. All
schoolteachers were civil servants. There were mass admission to the party,
because they wanted to keep their job, so they had to apply. Could you condemn
those? You— Can you put them in the same bucket? So what I’m trying to say 1s,
there are various degrees of guilt. (you know) If somebody joins a party in order
to keep his job and feed his family, well, I’m not so sure I want to put him in the
same bucket as some SS guard who beats up Jews for fun. So yes, they were both
Nazis, but within the party— And one needs to be objective about this, because
there are people, Jewish people in particular, who condemn them right out.
“They’re all bad.” Well, that isn’t the case. And so I always try to judge the
person by what duties he perform or she perform within the Nazi organization,
because some of them really, they were just pushed in there and they had nothing
to do with, other than being nominally party members.

[Tape 16]

Q: The impact of your wartime experiences on your spirituality?

A: I need to— The spirituality of my family as well as myself is very limited. Ours
was not a religious family at all. Not in any respect. And especially after my
mother got divorced, she did not in any form or shape encourage me to be
religious or adhere to Jewish religious traditions and so forth. So it was a minor
matter. We-we had really— We were Jews nominally. We were Jews by
registration, if you will. The— (you know) The Germans have a line item in their
birth certificates. That’s how they knew who was Jewish. You have to list your

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 62
religion. And they-they knew right away. And so we were nominally Jewish. But
as far as actually being a Jewish person who adheres to his religious belief by-by
practicing it, that wasn’t the case at all. Not in any form or shape.

Q: Did your wartime experiences strengthen or weaken your belief in a God?

A: It makes me question it. I mean, the unfallibility of the good Lord, who can do
anything good, bad, or indifferent, makes—made me doubt, made me very doubt. I
always admired the Jewish prisoners who were with me, that those people who
firmly believed in their God and prayed. And I deeply admired them, but I
couldn’t. I questioned. I questioned, I doubted, and I had little if any respect from
the higher power, from a God (if you wish). And it-1t’s changed after the war,
only to the effect that I thanked the higher power that made me survive. And— But
as to the misery which happened and the tragedies that happened, I had very
mixed emotion about the benevolence of God and—or a higher power or whatever
you want to call it. I know of religious Jews who, in the middle of all the misery,
celebrated the holidays and knew when they were, and firmly believed and
prayed. I could only admire this. But it didn’t— I couldn’t. I mean, it was— I was
never religious before, and I was certainly not religious after.

Q: And now?

A: Well, I-I basically do not believe in organized religion. I do not personally (and
that’s strictly speaking for myself) that if you go to church or you go to
synagogue, and somebody tells you to open page 235, and we all now sing on the
right page, last paragraph— That to me 1s not religion. That’s how the Army,
again, who tells you what you should do. Religion, you must do in your heart. I
feel closer to my Maker when I’m alone in the woods someplace, and the stars are
out, or the sun is shining. Then I know I can communicate. I can’t [communicate]
in a crowded synagogue, if you will, where everything’s regimented, every step is
practiced. That’s— 1s not for me, for other people, and will never be ..........

Q: Do you believe in an afterlife?

A: Frankly, I have never given it much thought. That’s one of the things I’ve never
particularly considered, and— You ever seen the movie Gone with the Wind?
“Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.” I really don’t know if I’m interested in
afterlife or whether I’m [coming back]. If I had a choice, I would say, “Oh please,
no. One is enough.” And I would not want to be resurrected as a chicken or
something else. (you know) That’s— You have to have a mythical belief in that,
and I don’t have that. And I don’t have no desire to feel that I will be resurrected
at one time or another into a human being in a different country, on a different
circumstances. But I don’t have that.

Q: When you think of the young man who came over on the boat and saw the Statue
of Liberty, and you imagined that life then, where are you in what you could have
imagined and hoped for yourself?

A: Well, obviously, I had very mixed emotions when I saw that Liberty. On the one
hand, I was afraid. A new country, a language I didn’t really understand, and an
experience— my mother back home, no one I knew, no one I could talk to, and I
should perhaps give you one brief detail. My biological father was in New York.
And he was the one who helped me to come over there, in addition to the Jewish
community and the Joint Distribution Center. And my father died while I was on
the ship. I never saw him again. And so I got to this country having lost the major
support I was hoping to have, and— even though we’d been— my mother’s been
divorced for many years. But I was still fairly close to him, and he lived in Berlin
as well. And so it was a great shock. So I came— The boy who come, the boy you
mentioned, who came to New York, had very mixed emotions. I didn’t even know
that my father was dead. It was only when I landed, when I was handed a message
that the had died. So it was somewhat-— On the one hand, you have great
anticipation. On the other hand, you are worried that you cannot hack it. And the
third one is, you don’t know what is going to face you. So it was a— basically a
hopeful arrival, but mixed with apprehension, because it’s not easy to get to a new

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 64
country where you don’t know the people, you don’t know the customs, you don’t
know the language, and so forth.

But that— My feeling towards my higher power were not impacted by that. I
strongly believe that God saved my life, and nothing else did. And even though I
wanted to die, he wouldn’t let me. And so [from]|— But there again, I was hoping
that—that life would be good to me and get me through this, because what else
could there be? Because what I went through (be) last four-four, eight years, [1f]
you will, nothing was compared to that. So whatever happened in America
couldn’t be any worse.

Q: How do you think the Holocaust experience impacted your choice of career?

A: Well, it impacted it in a sense that I first of all joined the military, which has a
built-in mission. Within the military, I choose intelligence, because first of all I
thought I was qualified for it, and secondly, I knew that the Holocaust was
something you want to prevent under all circumstances. The job I did was as an
intelligence [officer], in those days, during the Cold War, directed mainly towards
the countries Soviet Union and its allies. And they were not exactly the most
lovable people towards the Jewish people either. (you know) I mean, that sort of
thing. So being able to now (A) to defeat them if necessary, or to withstand
attacks by them, would in some ways help the Jewish people in-in the Soviet
Union. (you know) And it never came to a war, luckily, but that was sort of my
motivation towards the intelligence work, to do what I can. I’m a linguist, and that
helped. So I got accepted.

Q: Did you have any overall belief in justice or setting some wrong right?

A: Well, if you look at it in general, then I must say that my belief in right and
wrong, and good and bad, was in America, as I lived here, formed by what I saw
and heard and believed. Not everything I heard was true, but much of it was. The
things were better than I thought they would be, and the tremendous amount of
freedom. I mentioned already that nobody asked me if I wanted to move and

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 65
where I moved to. That was something so unknown to me, and so wonderful that I
could do that, that my attitudes towards life in general, my particular one 1n-in— 1s
or has been something like a wonder, you know, school really marvelous. Wasn’t
always very happy. I was very unhappy at times and very lonely and everything
else. But that was my own choice. (you know) Nobody made me go to America.
Nobody made me work in a factory up there. So that is my own choice. So you
learn from your experience and you become a mature human being which can
face reality, probably far better prepared than it used to be, where everything was
dictated, edicted, and directed by a hostile government, where you had no choice
to even think: is it good or is it bad? It’s always bad. You knew.

Q: The meaning of becoming an American citizen?

A: The choice wasn’t even mine. First of all, I wanted to become an American
citizen. But the work I was doing required a clearance, a secret clearance, later a
top secret clearance. And that could only be given to American citizens. So the
Army shipped me and my wife and-— to the States to get naturalized. It was a
wonderful moment. I— We-we were naturalized at different times. I was nat-
naturalized in 1951, hers was later. And when you raise your hand and you swear
to be an American citizen, and to obey the Constitution, which was different than
the Germans, who swore an oath of obedience to a person (Hitler), well, this one
was a document, which was the foundation for American democracy. And you
swear to uphold that. It was a very proud moment. It was a very, very proud
moment. I was there with-with a witness who swore that he knew me, that I was
an upstanding citizen. What he didn’t tell the judge there was that the met me two
hours before for the first time. And he was a military sergeant who was directed to
come with me and swear to my honest upbringing and honest character. And he
looked that judge clear in the eye and says, “Yes, sir, I know him for ten years or
longer.” And I thought, well, good. And-and so it was a very proud moment. It
was-— It was great. It was— It was something—

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 66

And of course the first thing you do, like all naturalized citizen (I don’t know
anybody who didn’t if they were old enough), you want a passport. You know.
The citizen oath and the document you get, which is a very nice formal type
document that on such and such a date you, Robert Behr, were naturalized by
Southern District Court of New York, and so forth, that was fine. But what you
really wanted was a passport. So the first thing I did, I applied for a passport. And
I was so proud when that document came. Now I really felt I was a citizen. With-
with the oath and the document, I knew I was; but feeling it took that little blue
book in my hand and saying “American citizen.” And that was a page in there
where it says that all persons having contact ... are requested to assist Mr. Behr,
Robert Behr. I mean, it was just-just a piece of paper, but it was tremendously
meaningful. It was— And you’ll find if you talk to other naturalized citizen, they
all want passport, even though they have no intention of traveling, but they want a
passport. (you know) It has a tremendous meaning. It still has today. I’m over in
Paris, or in Berlin, and I see the American embassy with a flag. It does something
to me. It-it’s not just “Oh, I have to go in here, and it’s another security and I have
to go through this and this.” This is my country. (you know) And even though
we’re not always universally liked, people don’t even like Americans, at least per
se, but for individuals they usually have a great deal respect. But when you see
the flag and you have that passport, talk about belonging, you really do. And you
feel it, and it’s there. And I don’t think I exaggerate. It’s true for me, but Ill bet
you dollars to donuts that’s true for many, many immigrants. It gives you
something which is—

Why do we stand up when we see the flag? Respect, isn’t it? It’s just a piece
of cloth. The Supreme Court said you can burn it. Nothing will happen to you. I
too-totally disagree with that decision. It’s not freedom of speech. To me, that’s
much more. People who take America for granted do not impress me. People have
died for what we are today. From the Revolutionary War, to the 1812 War, to the
Civil War—you know all that as well as I do. But people have died for that flag.
And to say you can burn it, or you can ignore it, to me that’s something— I lived

https://collections.ushmm.org

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 67
for that flag, because I wanted to come and be a part of that thing. And with the
little passport, I did it. Well, okay.

Q: Have you ever served on a jury?

A: Yes. Yes, I did.

Q: Tell me about that. Did that mean anything to you?

A: Do you want me to tell you about a rape trial?

Q: Not the details, just the idea of serving on a jury and how you exercised your
citizenship in that way.

A: Well, I was called, and— right here in— I was once in-in-in Ohio, I was called, and
I served, and it was a theft story. And I didn’t really have any great emotional
feeling as now that I’m accepted to serve on a [jury]. That would be lying. It was
something I had to do. The law required me to do this. The laws are different in
each state. In Ohio, it’s stricter than here. And you went, you— in, and you’re
hoping it wouldn’t take too long, because I was working still. But it didn’t give
me any great sense of patriotism. I mean, I would be lying if I say that. It was
something you had to do, you went through it, and when it’s over, it’s over. You
know.

And [had a rape trial here in Rockville, Maryland, where I was in the jury.
And that was quite emotional. The only redeeming factor was that the jury almost
unanimously was convinced of the guilt of the accused. (you know) Of course he
had a lawyer, and the lawyer said that wasn’t so, and— You have the details. But it
was, again, not something which made me proud to be an American. No, it didn’t.
It was just a job as a citizen you have to do, and that’s it.
Q: How did you respond to 9/11?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 68

A: No different than millions of other people all over the world. It was a day I had to
pick up my daughter from the hospital. She was there for—

Q: Would you begin with “On September 11"?

A: Okay. (how) Eleven-thirty, to me, was what it was-were to most other people, a
day of horror, a day of things. And what I had to fight from that day on, and really
literally fight, 1s an ingrained suspicion against Muslims. Remember the day? I
think it was either on the day or in the evening or the next day, when my wife sent
me to the store, and I saw a woman with that scarf over her head. And it almost
rubbed me the wrong way. That may have been a totally innocent woman who
wears that for religious reasons, or for tradition, and it brought in me almost ..
repel— repulsion that I-I— I said, ““What are they doing here? I mean, They—Those
are people, they killed 3,000 people.” In those fir-early hours it was still 3,000.
And so that-what that day had a— had to fight it. I had to fight the very system, the
very problem I was faced with, that people condemned you without knowing you,
because of your religious or ethnical-ethnical background. And here I was, doing
exactly the same thing. I had no idea who that lady was. She may have been the
nicest person in the world, but she— to me she was a Muslim, and those people
had just killed 3,000 innocent people in New York, and she disgusted me. I said,
“Why couldn’t she go to the store and take it off?” Well, then I thought, maybe
you ought to admire her, that in spite of the general feeling of the public against
Muslims, she wore her religious belief on top of it. But I couldn’t— The admiring
was secondary. The gut feeling was: I hate them. I really detest them. And so that
was my reaction for them.

Q: And now?

A: Well, we’re going to get into political philosophical. I think that the mullahs—

Q: Did it shift at all, that visceral feeling?

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 69

A: That visceral feel did not go away. It transcended its— from a personal antagonism
to a person I see on the street, towards a political antagonism on a broader picture.
I’m— Ino longer feel bad or-or offended by a person who wears a burga or
something here, if you will, and—but— That’s gone. I mean, I’m long over that, and
I respect them as I respect anyone. But it transferred itself to the broader picture
of the Islamic world which is out to destroy us. So that’s how it stands.

Q: How do you think your background and experience have shaped your view of the
future?

A: In what kind? What do you mean by future?

Q: The world view in terms of the future.

A: Well, what it’s done to me, having seen what Hitler got away with— You see,
there is always the memory. Hitler occupied the Rhineland, he occupied Austria,
he occupied Czechoslo— the Sudetenland, he occupied Czechoslovak, all without
firing a shot. Nobody—the French, the British, the Russians—nobody stood up to
him. Nobody. He got away with everything, and that is what I think and
remember. The world is relying on the United Nations now, that-that’s to-to solve
its problems, and we do not stand up to people. We-we do not— We talk. Oh, we
talk. And we’re brilliant where we talk about, and our Secretary of State travels
and meets with leaders and so forth, but we’re not going to tell somebody, “We
give you 36 hours or we’re going to nuke them, we’re going to nuke you, or throw
bombs on you,” whatever the world you want to be. Like we did in— finally on 1
September 1939, while France and Britain said, “If you don’t get out in two days,
out of Poland, we’re going to declare war.” And we did. That’s how World War II
started. Now, we don’t do that. We try to be diplomatic, we try to be—negotiate,
we do that— And that sometimes worries me (you know) and that I don’t see
America being tough enough, regardless of what other countries think, to do the
things we believe are right. We don’t. And again, that’s a personal opinion, may
be debatable, but I think sometimes we ought to stand up for what we believe, and

not just in Congress or in the White House Rose Garden; we ought to actually
make it [true]. Now, we did that in Iraq. We marched in there under false
pretenses. We got— We were lied to and we were misled to, and so you have to be
careful what you’re doing.

Q: Do things still trigger memories of your Holocaust experiences?

A: I don’t have very many physical things about it. I think about 1t sometimes and I
get reminded of it when I see, for example, when I see poor people, and
homeless—

Q: Reminded of “it’’? Start again. What can trigger memories?

A: I try to avoid having memories of my incarceration. I really don’t know- It
sometimes comes back. For example, if you get a questionnaire because you
applied for a job or a credit card or whatever, there’s a sentence in there, ‘s a
question in there: Are-are you or have you ever been imprisoned? What do you
put down there? Do you put down there yes, and then start writing two pages of
explanation? Or do you simply say no? So you see, it pursues you. In the normal
course of events where we have today a society which is extremely curious, you
have to fill out a questionnaire when you apply for a job, and they want to know.
It’s perfectly all right. But I don’t know what to answer. So mostly in that
particular case I’m inclined to say no, I was not in jail, because it wasn’t that type
of jail.

Give you another example how that comes back. I applied for a clearance, or
was asked to apply for a clearance. And in that, you have to list all your relatives.
This is very [easy because] I don’t have very many. One question, where was
your— These people rubbed me the wrong way. So I put down— Where was your
father born? So I put down Russia. But it isn’t true. See, what is true is that he
was born in East Prussia, which was occupied by the Russians in 1945, and still
is, which is now Russia. So his-his hometown was German at the time he was
born, and is Russia now. So what do you put down?

So the past comes back to haunt you, to— coupled with the requirements

today to strip your soul and bare your soul, [heart], because people have a right to
know about yourself. So it’s never far away. It’s never far away. And so the-the—
whether it’s the war or [with] the-the-the question told you about “Have you ever
been arrested?” Well, of course I’ve been arrested. (you know) But that’s not
what they mean. And you know. And it-it follows you, because the world changed
so much. My father was today born in Russia, but it wasn’t Russia at the time he
was born. (you know) And so I-I live with a split personality, if you will, because
you come into a lot of things which you can’t— which you don’t want to explain.
And yet you don’t know whether you should lie or—

Q: [not recorded]

A: So the quest— In answer to your question, of course it’s individual, because how
do you find love and devotion and characteristics which you like? Well, usually
you find them by accident. Everybody finds their spouse usually by accident,
unless they grow up together (that happens) and they get married, and that
becomes a good marriage or not-not becomes a good marriage. But in my case,
most of the people met their spouses by accident, and then you go back and do
this: Why do I love that person? What is it in her that attracts me? So you began
to look at the thing, and it could be sexual, it could be emotional, it could be all
sorts of things. It could be a combination of things. But somehow you got to
crystallize that, because what— when you have a friendship (in my case, I look at
it) which is purely sexual and doesn’t have any intellectual background, then you
can go with your wife to bed but you can’t talk to her. And you see, that’s a sad
thing, because sexual ambitions go away, but spirituals remain. And that’s where
it comes—becomes of importance. And I always begin that way. To me,
something— I want something lasting. I want to belong with somebody. Now
we’re back to where we started. I want to belong to somebody. And in order to do
that, I’ve got to have an intellectual background.

My wife is European, I’m European. I’m not even sure. I’ve often thought

about: Would I be happy with an American girl? And I don’t mean anybody in
particular. I have my doubts. Not that American ladies or women are worse, but
they have different— their upbringing, their characteristics. They’re not better or
they’re not worse; they’re just different. And without going into details, I found
so many ladies I met who are married, good marriages and everything, but there’s
a difference between them and a European woman. And again I want to stress, it’s
neither better nor worse. It’s just different. Culturally, education-wise, habit-wise,
you know, that sort of thing. (So, I hope I answered that.)

Q: The word “choice.”

A: Choice. Well, choice, you know, is a very broad range of things. You have
material choices (you want to buy something, you want to buy this television set
or that television set), you want to— it can be spiritually, you want to cho— you
want to choose that lady over that lady. So choice is a very partial endeavor. And
it goes back to what I normally do before I make a choice. If I can, if I’m rational
enough, I analyze what the options are. I analyze a little bit. If it’s a material
thing, I look at what other people write about a TV set; or if it’s a choice of a job,
then you ask yourself, will I be happy in it? So choice 1s a process of evaluation.
And you can do it in writing, which sometimes helps. You sit down and get your
thoughts, and then you reorganize it and say: What is the best outcome if my- if I
make choice A, choice B, or choice C? If you— If you spontaneously act to make a
choice, very often it’s the wrong one. (you know) It’s not whether you want a
hamburger or a cheeseburger. That isn’t very difficult. But when it comes to
human beings, when it comes to jobs, when it comes to psychological things, then
choice is something you need to treat very carefully. And I do that. I try to be no
spontaneous but selective and analytical, and then I make my choice. Doesn’t
always mean it’s the right one, but at least I try.

Q: And is it even more complicated when the absence of choice was so powerful? To
have it is also something that’s changed over the years?

Tape 17 ROBERT BEHR page 73

A: Well, choice in a ghetto is very, very small, because there were— usually weren’t
much options you have. And there was not much you can evaluate it, because you
knew what you wanted. You wanted to survive, that means you got to have
something to eat, (you know) and so forth. When the war was over, and when I
began to enter life, then the—the process of analyzing choice started. I really did
not have, in my young life before and after the camps, did I have the wisdom to
use choice as an analytical incentive—only after the war. Should I go to America?
Would it— Was that the right decision? Should I go into the military? (you know)
Those are choices which impact your life. And so it wasn’t just survival. It was
now the future. And so choice for me is an analytical process which I do as best I
can. (Quit writing.)
