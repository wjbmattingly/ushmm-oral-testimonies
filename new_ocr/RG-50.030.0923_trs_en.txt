SHIMON SCHWARZSCHILD
April 23, 2017
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Shimon Schwarzschild, on April 23", 2017, in Manhattan, New York City,
New York. Thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today, and to share
your story. Before I ask all of the questions related to your bio, could you tell me,
how do you pronounce your name properly? I’m not sure if I got it.
Answer: That’s wha — thank you for saying that, I was going to interrupt you. The
different parts of my family pronounce it differently. I pronounce it in a more
German way, which is Schwarzshield(ph).
Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay.
A: Cause it comes — it means black shield, or black coat of arms. However, other
parts of my family have gone to Schwarzschild. So I am Schwarzshield(ph),
Shimon Schwarzshield(ph).
Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay. And tell me, was Shimon your name at birth?
A: It wa—1it was my name at birth, and then 1-1— my parents, who were Orthodox
Jewish in a small town, had two lifestyles they lived by. They h — they — they had
their Jewish names. My father, for example, was Abraham, and they had their
token to assimilation, their Germanic names, and his Germanic name, if you’ll
pardon the expression, was Adolf.

Q: Oh no, really?
A: And in my case, I was born Shimon, but — but my Germanic name that I lived
for my whole lifetime in Germany was Siegbert.
Q: Siegbert.
A: And then when I came to this country, I changed it to Bert. And one day in — of
course in California, where else, up in a redwoods trees, I had this flash that said,
you've always liked the sound of Shimon, and Bert Schwarzschild is so guttural,
and I went to all the bay — I-I went to, almost instinctively to the banks, to the social
security, everywhere, and I took back Shimon.
Q: And about —
A: And that’s about 20 years ago, or longer.
Q: Oh, so when you were in your 70s already.
A: Pardon? I was —
Q: So —-
A: — yeah, in my 60s, maybe.
Q: In your 60s.
A: Or somewhere like that.
Q: So — so you had lived a great portion of your life as Bert.
A: As Bert, that’s right.

Q: Wow.
A: I—so, when I Google myself, the-there’s a life at Bert, and a li — and mor — the —
and a more recent life at Shimon.
Q: And just a question of curiosity, I hadn’t heard that before, though I’m sure
many, many people did so, that you have a name that 1s reflective of Orthodox
Judaism, and then another name that is more assimilation —
A: Germanic Siegbert, like sieg heil. I hate to say it, you know.
Q: Can you tell me, wa — was there a formal way? Did you have to se — did your
parents have to have formal documents that had one name, or could they have both?
Beca — I ask this, because later —
A: Well, when we first came here, I was Siegbert.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and —
Q: That’s to the uni — United States?
A: —I was in the navy, and they used the name of Siegbert. And I — and believe it
or not, when we came to this country as refugees, we had enemy a-alien — we ha —
we were classi — enemy aliens, and we had an enemy alien I.D. card with my
Siegbert on it, and we were not allowed to leave 25 miles of Jersey City, or have a
shortwave radio, which 1s kind of an interesting thing about —

Q: And how long did that last, this enemy alien —
A: It lasted pretty much until I went into the navy, at maybe a — 18, and became —
and then my parents became derivatives — got derivative citizenship paper. I’m not
sure exactly when the enemy alien category stopped. It was there for the war, I
believe, for the duration of the war. So I was in the navy for the duration of the war,
but — but we were classified as enemy aliens.
Q: Do you think you were an enemy alien while you were in the navy?
A: No, I think — I — I don’t know what my status was then wa —
Q: Okay.
A: — it opened a lot of doors, because once I was in the navy, then my parents were
— that gave me citizenship in some strange way, and then my parents were able to —
they exped — were able to expedite getting citizenship papers. They —
Q: And in Germany, do you know whether in Germany there was a way of
recording both your Jewish name, and your Germanic type name, officially, or was
that they had to choose one or the other?
A: I think that we were in Germany. I was only known as Siegbert, and my father
was only known as Adolf. But what happened is, there were also Jewish records,
but what happened, what I understand from — from the archivist who — who
rediscovered, and gave me my family tree [break]

Q: — and were allowed to have land. You know, they — they weren’t allowed to — I
mean, in general, under the Russian empire, it was a different system of land
distribution, and who owned it. Jews managed estates, but very few had — were
farmers themselves. But it was another form of exclusion.
A: I think that — that exclusion also went on in — in my region —
Q: Yeah.
A: — because even though my parents were cattle dealers, and their parents — my
father’s father was a cattle dealer, they didn’t have big amounts of land. They had —
they owned a house, in — in the village of Dettingen. And then my grandfather mo —
bought a house in Wertheim, and that’s where my father and his brother moved to,
to continue their — their cattle business, even — even though this meant — in those
days, ha — being a cattle dealer meant going on a bicycle every morning —
Q: Really?
A: — to all the villages, to find out who — what farmers were — were interested in
selling a cow, or what farmers were interested in buying a cow. So my father — there
were no cars — he would go out on a bicycle to — and I would sit on the bicycle if I
went out with him, to these different villages. And he would have, in each village,
he would have a no — a non-Jewish schmoozer.
Q: Really?

April 23, 2017
A: A man who was like his — his eyes and ears. And the first thing he would do in
the village, he would meet with the schmoozer in a beer garden, and then the
schmoozer would tell him the latest — what farmer had his cow, wanted to sell it, or
wanted to buy one. And then he would get — the schmoozer would get a commission
Q: I was going to ask, yeah.
A: — if my father bought or sold a cow that he had told him about.
Q: Now, did your father also have competition?
A: Yes, yes, there were other Jews who were also cattle dealers. There weren’t that
many in our region, but every Wednesday, there would be a marketplace, right near
our house, by the river, where all of the people, the — the cow — the cattle dealers
would bring their cows, and farmers. And then you meet th-the — the — the people
from the bigger cities, who were — worked for meat packing firms would come, and
there would be big negotiations, and I would hear them ar-argue over price, and
then there would be this — I would hear this gigantic clap. There were no invoices,
and no purchase orders, and once that clap took place, the lives of the people were
behind this — this transaction.
Q: Oh, how interesting.
A: And that’s how the cows were bought and sold in — in the —

April 23, 2017
Q: How interesting.
A: — when I was a kid. And then — and my father would so-sometimes argue, they
would get to so many marks —
Q: Okay.
A: — and before they would clap, he would also say, and 10 marks trinkgeld for the
children, which meant, a additional 10 marks for my savings account.
Q: And did he get it?
A: And they would argue over that, and they would be included, and then I would
feel good, be — I never saw the money, because it went into a bank account. But it
would include five or 10 marks of trinkgeld for the children.
Q: How cool is that?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: You know, it must have been like a — I can imagine, as a little kid, to be
accompanying your father as he does his business is a very important role. And then
to witness this is also interesting, cause for kids, everything 1s interesting.
A: I know.
Q: Yeah.
A: And actually, you know, my biography that I’m writing, I — I — I’m titling it,
“Drinking Krambambuli.” And you probably have never heard of krambambuli,

but what would happen is, when we got to a village, and you got into a tavern, I
would be thirsty, and — and — and there was a— ye — he would sometimes buy me a
soda, called Sharbaso(ph), which was the name of the company.
Q: Sharbaso(ph)?
A: Sharbaso(ph). And we — when I was in Wertheim the last time, the e — the
deputy mayor actually showed me an old advertising, with the name Sharbaso(ph)
on it, 1t doesn’t exist any more. Which was a name of an early pop — pop drink.
Q: What did it taste like?
A: Well, it was sweet. I don’t — I’m not sure any more whether it had bubbles in it. I
think it had bubbles.
Q: So it’s carbonated.
A: But — but — but then he would say, every now and then, either it wasn’t there, or
he didn’t want to spend the money on it, and he would say to me, drink wasser wie
das liebe vieh und denke es ist Krambambuli. Which translated means, drink
water like the dear cows, and think it is Krambambuli, and I never knew what
Krambambuli was until recently when I Googled it, and I found fe — [break] —
and he was depressed, and he never — he — he never really learned the language. It’s
a real reversal. My mother was the ballbuster, was up from six a.m. to midnight,
working and cleaning the house, and sh — when we came here, she became

emancipated. She found a job within days, whereas my father was lucky if he could
keep some job in working in a butcher store, a baker, move around sacks of
something, or a night watchman, he had a night watchman job, until some burglars
came in and — while he was asleep on one of the department store beds, and — an-
and — and he was fired from the job, I remember that. My father was — had a hard
time in this country, and my mother was a ballbuster here, she — she worked from
10 in the morning til six at night, and took care of all of us, and cooked the suppers
in advance, or e — so my father, who would usually be — often home and
unemployed, would heat up the stove — the — the meals for us when we — when we
came home from school.
Q: Wow.
A: Yeah. So — so —
Q: That’s very sad for him, yeah.
A: — so he — he was a very nostalgic, and very, as I said, romanticist. I wouldn’t say
that he was a happy go lucky person; he wasn’t. He was in World War I. He was —
he was injured, and he — an-and he kind of had some physical suffering and pain,
from broken ribs that he — he had not — not — not in a — 1n battle, but he had to take
care of some horses, as a soldier, and one of the horses —
Q: Kicked him?

A: — kicked him in the ribs. And — and so — so a lot of people saw him as sad and
sardonic. But on Friday night, when we — because we were Orthodox, we would —
he would — we would lie on the couch, and he would — we would sing songs, and —
and — or he would tell the stories.
Q: That was my next question, is, was he a storyteller?
A: He was a storyteller also.
Q: Yeah.
A: A-And — and he would often read the stories, you know. But — but he also told
stories, yeah.
Q: Wa - and was this a difference from how he had been in Germany? From how
you remember him from Germany’?
A: You mean when he came here?
Q: Yeah. In Germany, was he a different type of personality?
A: Yes, yes. He — he still enjoyed being home, he was not a — you know, he was not
like some of the other Germans in the town, who were always walking to the
marktplatz and drinking beer in the — in the taverns. But — but in this country, he
became very sedate, and in the sense that he — he would not want to leave the house.
And — and if we wanted to go to a movie house, my mother, who was so full of

energy, would literally push him off the couch, push him towards the door, put a hat
on his head, to — to — to get him to go out with us.
Q: That’s so sad.
A: And — and he would feel secure at home. He wou — he would have a stamp — he
had a stamp collection, and he would work on the stamp collection, or — he wasn’t
much of a reader. I think it was more a kind of a form of depression, you know. He
would say — one of his favorite phrases that I remember is, das wasser hat keine
balken, you know.
Q: The water has no —
A: Locks to hold onto for s — for life support. When we talked about going out — he
would not vote. Well, of course, Jersey City had a very crooked mayor. But he
would not vote, and the only — and what would happen, he’d be — he would allow
himself to be intimidated. The ward [indecipherable] come to our house, and
would insist that he go, and he literally would push him out to the precinct voting
place. And that’s the only ti — because he felt all politicians were crooks. But he
would allow himself to be somewhat bamboozled, you know. Yeah.
Q: Sad.
A: But he was a very gentle father, and I appreciated that — that side of his. He
actually, finally did find a profession again, because his brother and he — his brother

was a housepainter, and they went into partnership again. They were partners in the
cow business, and they went into partnership painting apartments in New York
City. I didn’t know the exact nature of —
Q: Of course not, but —
A: — 0-of — you know.
Q: — but you wanted to be part of, you know —
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: — like — like you wanted to be part of your brother’s stable.
A: Because I had been such an intrinsic part. Before the Hitler era, and propaganda,
I would spend a lot of time in their homes, I would do things with them. We — our
town would be flooded every year, and I have this vivid memory, the water from
the river would come into the streets, and we would put on — we would put on our
stilt — we would take stilts and we would play in the water, or we’d bicycle through
the water, you know. We did all kinds of kid stuff, or we would go up to the
haider(ph) where — and we’d scale the walls of the castle. The castle was broken
down. We did things that now are so verboten —
Q: Yeah.
A: — it isn’t even funny. They reconstructed the castle, it’s called Klein Heidelberg,
small Heidelberg, you know. And it’s now beautiful, and there are concerts and

musical events, and restaur — restaurants and everything in that castle. But when we
were there, was a ruin. And there was fences — a hole in, that we would go to. It
wasn’t even covered. And the — and we were told that — there were all these
folklores, that the — the robber baron for our castle would kidnap rich merchants,
put them in the bottom of this dungeon until they got ransom, and if they didn’t get
ransom, they remained —
Q: There.
A: — remained there. And we used to go and throw rocks down to — and — and — to
see this [phone ringing] — that’s okay — to see how long it would take for the rock
to hit bottom, you know, in this dungeon. [break] — the glass making factories
there, and — and so they had been expropriated, and they had been refugees, and
they had experienced some of the problems that it — Jews had. So they were
amongst the — a major initiative to fund and bring back the Jews to Wertheim.
Q: How interesting.
A: Yeah.
Q: How interesting.
A: And I met many of them, and one of them, who was one of the big glass
manufacturers, and was the founder o-of — which is now a very famous glass
museum in Wertheim, they — they offered my family this wonderful mansion

overlooking the castle, and provided us with a VW convertible, because they
happened to be on vacation, and they just turned it over for us to utilize. And — and
— and — and you know, and the other Jews who came back. When I came back — w-
we didn’t all come at once, so there was just maybe like a — a half a dozen, or a
dozen families who were wined and dined, and — and — and — and we were hosted
by all these different people in Wertheim, but many of them from the — the
community of — of the —
Q: From Dresden, yeah.
A: — the east r — the east German emigres — emigres to Wertheim.
Q: Well, you know, that — that’s also a story in itself, is that relationship between
west Germans and east Germans. And —
A: Or was it a —
Q: Wessie and Ossie.
A: That’s right.
Q: Particularly when there was still the wall there, and the different world
experiences that they had, the different views of one another that they had. And
depending on when these people came from Dresden, whether this was right after
the war, or before that wall became impermeable. But yes, there was a different
sensibility, you know, in that country, which is one of the tragedies of it. Let’s turn

now though, to another — a factual thing, just so that I can anchor this. Were — did
your parents also come back during that time, or was this just you?
A: Very — it’s very interesting. My brother and I each received invitation. The
mayor had actually visited my mother and my brother, and — and — and my mother
fell in love with him, actually. But when — when — but my family took the initiative,
I took the initiative. My brother did not, and he refused to go back. For him, it was
more an emotional thing. But he had — he had actually gone to Wertheim as a G.L.,
he was part of the occupation force — forces that occupied Frankfurt, and — and he
actually went t — past Wertheim, but he emotionally felt he could not return. He
also — wa-was a lack of forgiveness involved, also. And my uncle, the uncle I was
telling you about, he consider — called me a traitor for going back. I felt like I had
unfinished business in Wertheim. I had as much unfinished business in Wertheim
as the people who were dealing with the guilt complexes had, in inviting us back.
And I felt that I wanted to get past that.
Q: So I have another —
A: And it was — for me, I felt it was like a transaction —
Q: And —
A: — for me to go back, and — and revisit the place I had left.
Q: And did you find that unfinished business, and were you able to finish it?

A: Yes. One of the things that I pondered over, and — and I hope — well, if you get a
chance to read my memoirs, I wrote a poem called “Return to Wertheim.”
Q: Do you know it by heart?
A: I think it’s important, you know, maybe I should — I — I would love to read it, it’s
short.
Q: I would very much like for you to read it.
A: I'd love to read it and — and then talk about it, because it — it sums up —
Q: Let’s do that.
A: — the range of feelings. Can I do that now?
Q: Absolutely.

or just luck, that within days after my moment of rec-reconciliation, I should
receive an invitation to return to Wertheim, as a guest of its mayor and its
residents, who until now, I had rejected and renounced. I returned to Wertheim
with apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To
rediscover the aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I
reconnected with my classmates, who I had seen last, when they shunned me, as
they were dutily — dutifully indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from
which I and other Jewish students were excluded, where they were shown drawings
of evil looking, long-bearded Jewish men, sucking through straw — straws, a baby’s
blood, with glee. Now I reconnected with my child within, with the pain I’d felt
then, as one or another turned away in mid-play, remembering that I was a Jew, an
un-Aryan, too. Now they celebrated my return, at a special class reunion, the 10
year olds transformed into buxom women and beer bellied men. They listened in
disbelief, astonishment, and sadness, to — to my last experience in Wertheim, at
their hands. Quite different from what they remembered, or their consciences
allowed them to remember. The gray haired women sobbed, tears streaming down,
understanding their part in the tragedy, realizing that they too had been robbed of
their childhood innocence, feeling — feeling so long repressed, and hidden from you
— from view, by them, me, us. I’ve returned to Wertheim a half dozen times, have

been welcomed by friends old and new, have received and given outpourings of
hospitality. But occasionally uneasiness and paranoia seizes me, especially when I
see old strangers, my age, still envisaged them in a Nazi Brownshirt, or a black SS
uniform. I resist blurting out, did you leave your uniform at home? Still imagine
them once marching and singing [speaks German]. When the Jewish blood spurts
from the knife, then we will all be free. Deep physical wounds leave permanent
scars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of
flaring again. My return to Wertheim enabled me to revisit these wounds and scars,
to look at them closely, to pay attention to them. But also, to see them in
perspective. I can better deal with them now that I’m more at peace, accepting that
for better or worse, a part of me is German. The German of a Hitler, Goebbels,
Bormann, but also the German of a Beethoven, Goethe, Einstown(ph) — Einstein,
and Heine.”
Q: Thank you.
A: Yeah.
Q: Thank you. What a journey you describe in your poem, what a journey.
A: Well, it — I was amazed at myself when I wrote this, actually.
Q: Did it take you long?

Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild
April 23, 2017
A: No, it didn’t, you know, really it didn’t. Well, I did a little bit of maybe making
some corrections, but by and large, the whole thing came out because I remember
that when I read it, I read it in class, you know, we were like in a class, and the
teacher asked us to read it, and she said that’s a very powerful poem, you should try
to get — read it to others, you know? And I did actually do that for a while, in
California. Shortly after I read it, I did go to a couple of poetry classes, where I
read it. The “Synagogue of Laudenbach(ph)” is shorter.
Q: Okay.
A: And it’s different, but it’s also a tr — a true experience, based on a real
experience that I had in the village of my mother, when I went back.
Q: Okay.
A: Do you want me to read it?
Q: Yes, please.
A: It’s called the syna — “Synagogue of Laudenbach(ph).” “I walked in a dream,
past the empty lot, where once stood the simple, one story synagogue, victim of the
flames of Kristallnacht. I walked past my memories, memories of singing, praying,
chanting, of running, shouting, laughing, respectfully dressed in my young boy’s
finest, coming and going in the house of God. Now, 40 years later, not even a wall,
rubble, or — or ashes remain, to validate my childhood. The lives of those who

congregated each Sabbath, or the lives of those who destroyed it, except the
bittersweet and awesome memories, and the sterile, white, clean spot, where
emptiness cannot ease the terrible deed. The synagogue of Laudenbach(ph) is
gone, but memories linger on, with Jewish survivors and Nazi’s collaborators alike,
those few that are still alive, contemplating their own imminent departure, their own
past, present and future, and the final judgment being made in the hereafter of their
lives. Sequel: I walk past that empty, holy spot, to the modest cottage across the
street, where my grandparents once lived, and cross the street to pr — to pray, their
house still standing, as a witness to the past, the sweet and terrible past. Except for
the old man in the doorway, who is quizzically eyeing Karl and me. My German
friend and neighbor of my childhood, who had driven me to Laudenbach(ph) to
help me revisit my childhood memories. Here’s Jacob’s(ph) grandson from
America, Karl explained to the old man. He wants to visit his grandfather’s house,
with your permission. Could he look inside? The old man’s face went ashen. He
trembled, tottered, almost collapsed, then shouted, I paid Jacob(ph) for the house in
full. I bought it in good faith, a long time ago. He shut the white, picket gate, to
keep out the visiting demon from America, who had come to — to — to devour him.
Afterwards, my friend Karl explained, no doubt that man had been a loyal Nazi,
rewarded with a purchase of the house, bought cheaply, through blackmail and

intimidation, after the terror of Kristallnacht, after the synagogue was torched. I
left Laudenbach(ph), resolved never to return, but carrying with me forever, those
bittersweet memories of a synagogue that once existed, and the simple, sharing,
country Jews, who were once part of my life. Goodbye. Auf niemersehen(ph).”
Q: Wow. Auf niemersehen(ph), can you tell us what that means?
A: Well, I’m not sure whether it’s appropriate, but wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen
means goodbye, and I just — I just sort of brutalized it, the word, and made it made-
up, niemersehen(ph).
Q: Well —
A: Wiedersehen, you know, goodbye means to see you again, that’s the German
expression of goodbye.
Q: Yeah.
A: See you again.
Q: And in — auf niemersehen(ph) means what?
A: Means, I will ne — I — that’s the last time I’m gonna be there.

Q: When you went back, and you met with these former classmates, you mentioned
earlier that it was like therapy.
A: Yeah.
Q: Was it therapy, or was it something that just had some of the effects?
A: Well, it was therapy in the sense that I — I — I related my experience there, and I

women who started sobbing around me.

Wertheim and to all the towns in that region, and they picked up all of the je — the
birth records of the Jews and took them away. And they took them — my friend the
archivist said they probably took it to a warehouse in Frankfurt for that region,
which got saturation bombed, and they never found the records again. So he put

Baden and Wirttemberg. And — and he ordered that the Catholic rec — birth
records be in the Catholic church, the Protestant birth records in the Protestant
church, and the Jewish records in the Catholic church, because the Catholic church
was a minority church, you know, Lutheran —

played a lot with children, even though we — Orthodox Jews, we didn’t live in an
Orthodox community, as such, you know, we were spread out over the town, so we
did a lot of playing with — with non-Jewish kids, who were cro — who lived to —
down the street, or across the street from us. So during the week we did a lot of
playing wi-with — with other children, and on — on Saturday we’d be at home, we
had an old phonograph. My father — we’d get together on Friday night. We would
sometimes walk to a— a—a-— to the river, where we would bring a — breadcrumbs
to put in the water for the fish, or something like that. Although I think that was
more associated with Passover, I remember — I’m trying to remember it. But we
didn’t do very much, there was no movies, there was no — we would sometimes
visit other Jewish families.
Q: Were there many in that time?

rabbi, who I couldn’t stand — I didn’t like, but —
Q: Why not?
A: [indecipherable] Sichal(ph) was his name, Sichal(ph). He was — he was very —
a hard taskmaster, and very disciplinarian, like all — like the teachers in the — in the
public schools. And I remember him taking a girl in my class, who was also
learning Hebrew with me, over his —
Q: Knees?

thing. I’ve never forgiven him for that, you know, although I don’t remember being
hit by him, but I remember him hitting her, and — and — a-and — and — but I
remember the — the positive things about going to the synagogue was the singing
and the chanting, and being — and usually with — always with — with my father and

your father did, or less so?
A: Well, she was always — I mean, she spend most of her time in the house, if — far

we did have the help from some of the — from a woman, someone from the villages,
who sometimes came to help. Bu-But — but her main — her main domain was the
house and the children, and family. And that’s why I felt she became emancipated

she was extremely pro-life, she was extremely war — generous to us as growing up
children and young men, you know. I had a hard time sometimes with it, because

this fantastic castle. And we would — we would — I would — I — that — I’ve forgotten.
See, and I’m glad you asking. I spent most of my days with other children, no —
Jewish or non-Jewish, mostly non-Jewish, because other than — somehow, there was
the Jewish community in the synagogue, and there was the Jewish rabbi that we
took lessons with, but there was not a strong community that — where children
interacted with each other.

because all these children, when — when — when Hitler came in power, and these —
a-and the Nazis started prevailing, they would go — we all went to school together,
from different parts of the city, but they would go also into eugenics classes, where
they were taught to — about the inferiority of Jews, and they — and they stopped —
slowly stopped playing with me, because — because they were told that they — well,
they — I remember one day — this — this is very vivid. It’s in my biography. I
remember one day walking to school by myself, because the school wasn’t that far
away, and — and — and there is — there was a — like a glass covered stand in front of
the school, with a newspaper inside, and the newspaper was “Der Stiirmer.” And
on the front page, there was a picture of a group of long-bearded, black clothed
Jews with prayer locks, sucking blood from a baby in the middle of the — of them.
And — and so, that’s the kind of propaganda that they were subjected to. And so,
slowly, every — they started — stopped playing with me. This is towards the end,
before we left, in many — over many months. And every now and then a ca — some
kid would play with me, and then suddenly remember that I was Jewish. And I
remember that, and I remember sometimes the — I was jealous also. That’s the other

A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Okay. So please, the — the Wertheim poem.
A: Okay, it’s called “Return to Wertheim.” “I’ve made my peace with the past,
my peace with the Germans. Not with the SS trooper — troops who goose-stepped
past our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on
cobblestones, singing, no, shouting in 0 — in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts
from the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the
cells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome
words, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the
memory of that night, and by — and by my masochistic instinct to remember the
event, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that
was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys,
Indians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America, in Depression, but
breathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us
working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers 1n a strange
land. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything
German, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the
town’s Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the
gravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a final

insult to the dead. Wasn’t it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of
the living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in
true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned
everything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. I refused to
buy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a
German car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I
confronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil,
to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans,
shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all
universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to
the realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of
the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that
occurred 100 years ago, right here in California, a bounty on their scalps. Right
here, in the good old USA, the land of Washington and Lincoln, the land of
Wounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious
decision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I
experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults
at me, without ever bothering to know me. A heavy weight lifted from my
shoulders, the good vibes that I now felt, must have echoed, reverberated,

ricocheted around the world, and must have found the psychic antennas on the roof
of Wertheim city hall, must have been received and heard by Josef Scheuermann,
Wertheim’s democratic mayor, who was scouring the world, searching for the
town’s 100 living Jewish survivors, out of —’ [break] — group therapy, they — and
you know, I didn’t learn very much about how the — what happened in their lives.
Tha-That maybe — maybe if I should go back again, that would be something I sh —
really should explore, except not — there’s only one classmate left, and he is sort of
my friend and host. And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and —
and I — I —I s— don’t know what a lot of the people were doing. They were all
caught up in — in their lives. My br — the one classmate who’s left was — was in —
conscripted in the army, was sent to Russia, was — became a prisoner of war for two
years, or three years, he was in a Russian — the worst possible condition Ru-Russian
prison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don’t know whether
he joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody did. Ye-Ye-Ye —
I remember that even as a child, if you — if you wanted to — th-the — the bully boys,
the Brownshirts, would boycott stores, Jewish stores. We had a MH — a department
store in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-I-d was the name, Max(ph) Held was the
owner, Held was the department store. And they would have the Brownshirts in
front of the Jewish businesses, to censor, or — anybody who — any non-Jew who —

who went into the store. And they would economically get back to — at them. And
of course, Hitler passed all kinds of laws; one in particular had affected my father,
that if you owed any debts to a Jew, you didn’t have to pay back. So my father, his
business depended on the — the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a
cow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a — when the — when the crops
came in. So — so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father,
because they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And —
and I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in
the morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of
our house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a
farmer standing there, with a cow. Because he did not — he wanted to transact a sale,
but he did not want to be seen by anyone —
Q: But he was doing it.
A: — selling — doing a transaction with my father. And that was the economic side of
it, you know. This fre — person, Karl Stahl(ph), he — he comes from fa — he was
right across the street, he — he was a carpenter, he had a carpentry shop, and I
practically lived there. You asked me what did I do from morning to night, I often

along our street. That’s why I didn’t have a th — I can’t remember much of a Jewish
community, other than going to the s — to the synagogue to pray. I — there was very
little playing that I did with Jewish kids, because a — because my — the community

And the man identified himself, his name was Becker, and he — he had a Jewish

him to divorce his wife, he refused to do it. They stripped him of his office, and he
became a factory worker, and they took his wife away to a concentration camp. And
so he — when he asked my brother for help, he didn’t know whether his wife was
still alive or no — or dead. And my brother helped him, and in some way, through

made him more distrustful, and maybe paran — more paranoid about who they —
who the Germans were of that day, and what they did, or didn’t do against the Jews,

Q: When you saw the reaction of your former classmates —

make contact with someone who survived, must have had — well, it only — it isn’t

Q: Well, you know, one of the reasons that I focus so much on this — and we’ ll

issues, Sometimes personal issues, emotional issues, psychological; I don’t know
what words to put on it, that ar — that are so universal. When an individual, as part
of a group, experiences betrayal and trauma, and cruelty, and repression, you lose
faith. And part of the issue when a person survives that kind of experience — and
I’m not being very specific in it, but somewhere where you lost faith, and felt
betrayal, is how do you regain it back?

brewery, you know, as part of the outings they took us to. And there were these two
reporters from the local newspaper, who came to cover it. And you could see they
were literally yawning. What kind of an assignment is that, listening to these

middle-age Jews talk about Wertheim, you know? And — and one of them was
sitting — well, they were both sitting near us, or next to us, and we started talking.
And when we — when I started describing the — my ex — my experience as a child,
and what happened, etcetera, they became so absorbed, that when the — it came time
they had a deadline to go back to the paper, and they did not want to go. They said,
you know, the trouble is that our parents taught nothing, say nothing about it, and
you’re telling us everything that we’ve never heard. That — that was such an
interesting thing.
Q: Did that help towards the forgiveness? Is that what you —
A: Pardon?
Q: Did that help towards the forgiveness? Because —
A: Yeah, in a sense.
Q: Okay.
A: It was like, here were these young people — the ol — the old people never talked
about it, because they were — had their — they were carrying all their guilt around.
And the young people, their sons, their children, never heard — never heard about it.

youth egging my classmates on to try to beat me up.

obscenities. The older ones, usually, but they were trying to inculcate my

Jew any mome — we — we left Orthodox — my parents, when we came here, it was

Jewish temple, but — which you could walk to if you had a half hour or 45 minutes
to walk. And — and — and of course, we never rode in Germany, on a — in a car or
bus, and so at the beginning, they didn’t, and we didn’t. But then we slowly, the
practicality of it was that we started taking the bus, or — or go — or if someone
picked us up to go to the temple. My mother kept milchtig(ph) and fleishtig(ph)
initially, and she never — she — and that ultimately went down the — the drain, but —
but we — we — she never brought any pork, or any —
Q: Shrimp, yeah.
A: — bacon or — we had Jewish bacon during the whole time we were there. But they
gave up every — every other part of it, and — and in a sense, so — so did I and my
brother. I— we — in my life, I— we all — I had been — I have gone to shul, or to a
temple for high holidays. In California I did it almost every year, even here, for
some reason, because Naomi is not at all practical Jewish — relig — religious, rather.
She’s Jewish, very much openly Jewish, you know. We — we — we — we — lately —
we have — we have Passover. I — I’ve been — I was invited to the first Passover — the
second night, by relatives of mine who are Orthodox Jewish, still. My — my cousin,

went there — I remember one situation where we went there, and they would close
all the shades, and curtains, because you were not allowed to have a shortwave set. I
don’t know whether that was a Jewish edict, or whether that was a Nazi edict, you

because about three months ago — oh, no, was six months ago. I had been to
Wertheim, and the Wertheim did a major story on my return. They also un-
unveiled a Jewish section in the Wertheim museum, a whole floor about the Jewish
community of Wertheim. And I would like that biography I’m giving you to go
there —

When I went there, the director of the museum took me on a personal tour with a
bunch of my classmate and other people, and — and I was very appreciative that they
now had something to tell the story of the Jews of Wertheim. But I felt it was a
very static exhibit. And I said — I remember saying to the director, you know, if
you’re gonna have schoolchildren come there to tell the story, it would be useful if

parents and great-parents, they all came from that same town. And one day — but he
did have a — somewhat of a temper, my father. And one day, not long before we
left, a Nazi, a Brownshirt — they — the Nazis were already coming into our place.
They had a thing called eintopfgericht.
Q: Eintopfgericht?
A: Yeah. I don’t know whether you’ve ever heard of it, even.
Q: No.
A: During the height — during even at that time of the Nazi era, even though it was
the early era, they had a thing called winter health.
Q: Okay.
A: But it was a —I had learned since, it was a disguised way of hoarding for the —
for — for war.
Q: Okay.
A: Hitler was hoarding for war. They had warehouses, geographically located. And
they would come, I’m not sure whether it was once a week, or once a month. There
would be some Nazis coming, and they would — and you had to cook a so-called
eintopfgericht, which means a one-pot —

Q: Yeah.
A: And all of the hypothetical savings of food that you didn’t use because you had
an eintopfgericht, they would pick up to sto — warehouse. And they would be
uniformed Nazis who would come. Now they — they didn’t come to hound Jews,
they — they didn’t come just — this was not a Jewish thing, this was everybody.
Q: So you cooked them a meal?
A: You — no, you didn’t cook a meal. You cooked yourself your meal on a— ina
One pot service, meaning you made the meal in one pot, like a stew, or something.
Q: Okay.
A: And whatever, hypothetical you saved — and I don’t know who decided, and who
measured —
Q: So you —

Food that you — could be stored —

father. I don’t know what the — what the words were, at the door, and my father
punched him in the face.
Q: Uh-oh.
A: And he was jailed for two weeks. And of — you know, at that point, all — all the
Jewish people there, they — they saw Hitler as some bizarre phenomena, especially
in Wertheim, because those people had been there for multi, multi, multi-
generations. It would blow over. It was a thing that would blow over. And they —
and — and some of them laughed when my father — and my father decided he did not
want to s — that was when he first decided he’s not going to stay in this
environment. And we had — we had only one distant relative. It was the widow. She
was a southern Jewish belle, who was married to a distant cousin of my father, who
had already died in Jersey City. And we wrote — that’s the only American address
we had. And so, my father or my mother wrote a letter to her, Aunt Bertha, and —
and asked if she would get us a visa, because this is yel — total misunderstanding of

most people. They think, why did those 900,000 Jews, why didn’t they just go, you
know?
Q: Yeah.
A: Even if you wanted to go, you can’t go unless you have a — a legal document, to
allow you out. I mean, after Kristallnacht, some people would flee. And if they had
non-Jewish friends who would hide them, they would find their way across the
border. But no — normally, you couldn’t go. So sh — sh — he sent this letter asking
for a visa, and she had to get it translated, she — she —
Q: She didn’t speak German.

anything?
A: That’s a story. You were not al — Jews were not allowed to leave with any
money. We were able to have a lift — we had a small — was a crate, where we had
some of our belongings. We didn’t bring furniture, but linen, and you know,
belongings of that sort.
Q: Household things, yeah.
A: Yeah. But the law was very strict about money, or valuables. And what
happened is, my Uncle David, and unc — the uncle who lived in Wiirzburg,
accompanied us to the ship in Bremen, at Bremerhaven. And my mother decided —
well, we took along — we had some gold coins, maybe five or six. And she had put
them in a cold cream jar, to — and we got on the train from Bremen to
Bremerhaven, and there were these Nazi guards going back and forth on the train.
And my uncle had come along just to escort us to the ship. He — he didn’t leave
until two — two, three years later. We got him the visa to — to come out. This 1s the
uncle, the famous uncle I was telling you about. So he came along, and my mother
got s — really scared. And in the last instant, she took out the gold coins from the

Q: Works.
A: — doing — work ethics, doing it yourself. So we never — we never asked for — I
don’t know whether we even would have taken a penny from her. Well, what she
did do is — there was a bachelor relative, who lived in Jersey City also, and she
didn’t invite us into her beautiful home, for whatever reason, you know. But he was
a bachelor, and he had an apartment. So, for the first two or three months, we were
live — able to live in a — 1n — in — in — 1n a small room that he had in the apartment.
And she also believed strongly in starting school right away. So, two days after we
arrived, and my brother and I spoke absolutely no English, she took us to the public
school nearby. We enrolled, and we started school.

he was in the sixth grade in Germany, | was in the fourth grade. They put him into
the fourth grade with me, and they gave us seats next to each other, so that we could
whisper — whisper to each other. And we learned the language that way, within six
months.

Q: Okay.

Q: Is what was it like leaving your home?
A: Yeah, okay. So, my uncle came and took us by car to his home in Wurzburg,
and from there we ultimately — he went with us, by train. But as we were leaving, a

there for another almost two years, until we managed to get them a visa to go. And

Jews leaving, you know —

the German government ultimately paid for it.

African-American I saw; she had a livery — a uniformed chauffeur, Conrad.

Pierce Arrow, where my aunt was sitting in her beautiful, black suit. They drove
away from the ship, and when they got to Times Square, I became totally
nauseous, and Conrad s — had to stop the car, so I could get out and vomit at Times
Square. That was my first experience of Times Square, vomiting there. An-And

Q: Normandy.

Q: Wow.
A: So he was in the occupation of Normandy, and for some reason, maybe because
I was German, maybe because of fate, they sent me — I — I was put on a ship, I was
assigned to a ship that was in the — in the Pacific.
Q: Did you —
A: Oh, I didn’t — I— I didn’t go right away. What happened is, when I was in boot
training, they give you this gen — gee — general — GCT, general classification test
that your whole life in the military is dependent on that. And I got a very high
grade. So they send me to what was then the hottest kind of training, which was
radar and electronic technician training. So for one — almost one full year, I was — I
was going to navy training schools in Chicago, and Gulfport, Mississippi. And
then I was flown to Hawaii, and I was we — was sent to an advanced radar school,

was go — |] — they put me on a plane that flew from Honolulu to Okinawa, during
the height of the Okinawa fighting.
Q: Oh my God.
A: And I was assigned to a special unit that was made up of two pilots, and — and
about five specialists, radium and radar man technician, and — and two officers. We
were known as a fighter director team, and we were assigned to a destroyer that was
called a picket ship, which — which goes in a little circle on the outs — they — all
around the island of Okinawa. That was the time of the kamikazes, who were — and
—and they were early warning ships for kamikaze suicide planes. So I was in this
team, and my job was, I would be in the — the raid — the room which had the radar,
was called the CI, combat information center. And I would have a dual earphone
on, and I would watch the blips on the radar, and if — and if — and when we saw a —
an approaching kamikaze, I would man — I would maneuver that our pilots would
scramble from the airport — from the air — airfield in Okinawa, and my job was to
maneuver our plane until it would make contact, radar and eye contact with the
kamikaze. And then they would say, tally-ho, and my job was over. And — but you
know, it didn’t always work as beautifully as it sounds, because there were many
kamikazes who crashed into picket ships, because they knew that the picket ships —
these were destroyers, all the way al — all in different spots around the island. They

April 23, 2017
knew that these picket ships were early warning ships. And up to that point, I saw
the whole — my whole navy duty being on destroyers and all that, as being some
romantic, interesting, new experience. Until one day. What had happened — I hope
I’m not boring you by all this, but —
Q: No, no, no, no.
A: — there was a terrible tragedy during the war, that probably most Americans
don’t even know about. And that was that a flotilla of American ships, in the Straits
of Mindanao, which is off the coast of the Philippines, had lost — okay — ha —
Q: Had lost.
A: — got caught in a — in a typhoon. They had been — they had already lost most of
their fuel, and the typhoon lasted so long, that they lost their forward motion. And —
and many — many of the destroyers and warships capsized. And there were over
5,000 American sailors and so — sailors who lost their lives. That’s what I heard the
figure was. I haven’t — I need to Google that, I haven’t Googled that. But as a result
of that, the navy passed a special, ironclad ordinance that any navy ship that gets
below 40 percent of its fuel, 1t must go get refueled, because of that disaster. And
so, my picket ship were — ha — went below 40 percent. We immediately headed for
the island to get refueled. We were just over the horizon when the pick — the —
another ship had been sent out to take our place, got a direct hit from a kamikaze.

The Vichy guards allowed them to escape. And they made contact with the
underground, and they were then distributed to different monasteries, and different
places. So my cousin was shifted from one place to another during the war.
Whenever the Nazi presence became too worrisome, they would move him to
another place. And ultimately, he was in a camp in the Pyrenees at the end of the
war, and we got him out. But he — he — I — I don’t know whether because or in spite

Q: No, no. No, not life enhancing.
A: Yeah.
Q: When did you first learn of the thing called the Holocaust?
A: You know, I don’t think — I don’t think I learned about the Holocaust until the
end of the war, you know. And I often — it’s not that I berate myself, but I wa — I
wonder now about the relative insensitivity of our whole fa — my whole family. We
were struggling for survival, this was the Depression. And it wasn’t just that my
father didn’t have any profession, other than cows. It was like pe — it was very hard
to find any work and to — an-and to survive. An-And we, other than these individual
stories that we had, like getting our f — getting our relatives out of there —
Q: That’s quite something.
A: That’s — yeah. Now, the relatives we got out, they all were pre-Kristallnacht.
And there was one terrible tragedy of my Uncle Dave, th-the — the uncle, his — his —
his wife’s sister was 1n a — lived in a town called Spangenberger(ph) —
Q: Spangenberger(ph).
A: —I forgot — Ursula was her name, Ursula. And she developed an acute appendix
when she was maybe 17, 18. And they would not allow any ambulances for Jews

until the morning, and she died, as a result of the blood poisoning from the
appendix.
Q: The burst appendix.
A: So, we had those kind of — I remember that personal tragedy, you know. We
didn’t hear very — we didn’t — we were not — and trying to get our own relatives out,
and trying to survive and helping them to survive.
Q: That’s quite a full plate.
A: That was really our major plan in life, you know.
Q: That’s a full plate.
A: Yeah, yeah. And — and I — I —I found out about the intransigence of our — of the
Roosevelt administration and some of the anti-Semitic actions, or inactions, really,
much, much later. Much, much later. At the time, I do know that we worshipped
FDR, and I still have good feelings about him, in spite of his failings, you know,
and — and some of the negative things that he did. We — we often go to the FDR
museum here in upstate New York. But — but we just didn’t — we heard about this —
we knew about the personal tragedies, and we were trying very hard to get our
relatives out. We knew tr — these things were going on. Of course, we had our own
experience, and that was earlier.
Q: Yeah.

A: But it was really — it really was self-centered. My parents were self-centered.
The on — the only thing is they adored FDR, and we had a picture of FDR on the
wall, you know. But they were not into any kind of altruistic endeavors.
Q: You know, I do — from your description it’s almost apologetic, but everybody
who has gone through some sort of hardship like this, is inevitably self-centered.
People say that you can start thinking of others when you feel secure, and you have
food on the table, and a roof over your head.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: That’s when you can start thinking of a larger picture.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: So, it sound perfectly normal, perfect —
A: I have to go again, I’m sorry.
Q: Okay, that’s okay.
A: This kind of — [break]
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, th-the question was, yeah, when did you find out about the full scope of the
Holocaust, and for you the question was, what motivates people to look beyond, or
not look beyond their own circumstances, if I paraphrased correctly.

A: Mm-hm. Well, I can’t remember the exact moment. Remember, I was — I was in
the war, I was discharged from the Pacific in the early part of ’46.
Q: Okay.
A: And that was already — VJ Day happened —
Q: August.
A: Yeah. And — and although we were not — in the navy we were not deprived of
reading papers, newspapers and things. I — I— I was not — I was not into any
political or social awareness — I ha — I hate to say that about myself — at that time.
Oh yeah, tha — that came later, because actually, at some — I was called back during
the Korean war, and — and I actually had an incident where I wa — where I—I pa—I
passed on some political magazines to a— a fellow sailor, and he — he took the
articles so — too literally, and one day when he — when they were at a battle station,
he said something abou — liberal, politically liberal, and another — the petty officer
in — in charge called him a communist, and he punched him. And — and we — you —
it’s like punching a superior officer. And the captain of the ship then came to me,
and he said, I cannot tell you wa — what to read, I cannot tell you not to subscribe to
“The Progressive” magazine, but I’m asking you not to pass it on to other people. I
don’t know whether you know “The Progressive,” do you? It’s — I love that
magazine, I still do, even decades and decades later, you know.

Q: So, did —
A: That was — that was in 1950, though.
Q: Did Walter come back with stories of what he saw’?
A: He didn’t — he didn’t — he told me some stor — he — he didn’t g — there were not —
the o — th — other than the detail of the — of — of the — Mr. Becker.
Q: Becker, mm-hm.
A: And I think — I th — I think that, you know, he — he didn’t come back with many
details to me — with me. A-And, you know, and when I think about it, there are a lot
of insens — things I was insensitive to. I should have taken the initiative and — and
asked him, but who knows where I was in my life then, when he — when I came
back, and he came back. He didn’t — he must have had stories, but he — he — he
never got to — to write anything down. I’m the one who — who is doing it now, and
whatever little I’m a — I’m able to write down in my — in my memoirs about his
family, as well, you know. He — he didn’t — he didn’t — there was a phrase — his wife
is still alive, Vicky, and — and we are very — you know, we’re close. She lives in
Cherry Hill, and — and I visit her from time to time. But — but he never shared a lot,
it — with her either, if — 1f he had stories about his German — his German
connections. She had her own story to tell, because she was an Egyptian Jew who
fled Egypt, you know.

Q: Oh wow.
A: Yeah.
Q: Oh wow. Are there — we’re coming close to the end of our interview. I wanted to
cover these main points, and you’ve done beautifully. Thank you so much.
A: Thank you. See, I think it was — it feels a little disjointed, but —
Q: It’s not.
A: — life is that way, you know.
Q: Yeah. Is there something I haven’t asked you, that you think is important, you
know, in connection with everything that we spoke, and the events as well as the —
the topics, and the interpretation of it, that you’d want people to know about, that
you’d want to underst —
A: And you’re talking about my — my experience in Germany’?
Q: Your experience in Germany, your family’s experience, and then later, how you
processed it.
A: Okay. Well, my li— you know, I mean, the sense of forgiveness and conciliation
took me a long way, and I really feel — I don’t feel uncomfortable about it. A-And —
and — and because of my involvement with — with the world’s problems, I ha — I’ve
gained — I’ve gained actually, a strong respect for the present day Germany. And
especially their attitude and their actions in terms of taking in refugees.

Q: Like from Syria, what is going on today?
A: Yeah, and — and I saw — experienced that in my own town. They actually cleared
a building in the police academy that they used for recruits or whatever, as a — an
area where they took that — that mini-region took about 4,000 refugees. And they’re
— and — and they’re distributed, not just in Wertheim, but to other towns in the area.
And it’s — it’s become a con-controversial issue, to some extent.
Q: Sure.
A: But — but — but — but I— I have a strong — I have a strong respect for them for
doing that, and — and in a sense, it’s a strong respect for — for — for the postwar
Germany to reconc — to — to — to visualize the horrors that took place, and to ta — to
try to reverse any of such a thing from happening now, you know. I — I know that
there’s a lot of political struggling going on there, as well as every place in Europe,
and I’m — I —I—I-—I re —I think I’m moving away from your question —
Q: No, but that’s —
A: — and generalizing it a little bit.
Q: But that’s okay, that’s okay.
A: But — but I — since I changed careers, and I — I di — never — I never went on to
that, I changed careers because I didn’t want to accept any more money from the
military, our military. And I found one day I had my own — I had a business with

five other engineers, and — and I started re — noticing that almost every purchase
order we got, including — this is for just scientific instrumentation that we sold, it all
had either — the Department of Defense was paying for them all. And I finally
decided I had been — I had gotten a salary twice already from the military. I didn’t
want anything to do with it any more. And I just — and I o — I had been an
environmentalist, so I just totally changed careers, and — and — and I — a-and — well,
I’m getting back now, it’s just sort of a long way.
Q: That’s okay.
A: And I really respect and admire Germany for their taking a very strong green
policy there now, 35 percent green, and we talk a lot here, and we’re less than five
percent green right now, a-and with Trump, who knows whether that will go up or
down.
Q: Yeah.
A: And — and so I’ve developed a — a — a real respect of — for — for — and I — and
they’re fighting the same political battles we are here now. The new — the new
Germany, and the new Germans, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: They have their despotic, and they have their right and their mid — their left, and
— and we don’t know what will happen.

Q: I thank you.
A: Yeah.
Q: Thank you very, very much.
A: Well, I don’t know whether that was the perfect note to end, but —
Q: No, it 1s.
A: Yeah.
Q: I mean, in many ways it is, because so much of what your story is, is that leaving
Germany, coming back to Germany, the role that it played in your life, and how to
— how to — I’d — understand it, the — the pro — you know, what — what it is that you
had to — the various paths you had to take to get to where you are. It’s not an easy
one. And I very much appreciate your perspective —
A: Thank you.
Q: — on it.
A: Well, I — it — it — it feels disjointed, but I didn’t pre — you don’t prepare for this
kind of thing, you know.
Q: No, no, no.
A: Yeah.
Q: And every person is an expert in their own life
A: Yeah.

Q: So you can’t really read up.
A: Yeah.
Q: You know? You’ve known it, and you — that’s what we want, 1s we want to hear
your — your words, your views, rather than citing, you know, a footnote from
someplace.
A: Well —
Q: So, I will say then, in conclusion — unless you have something else to say, I have
a concluding kind of statement.
A: Well, the only thing is, I think my German experience helped me to be
compassionate about all species and all wrongs that are committed. And I can’t fix
them, I’m only a single person, and I’m in — pretty much getting to the end of my
life. But in a way, in a way, my experience at the hands of the Nazis helped me in
maybe becoming a better human being.
Q: How ironic. But it’s 1— how tronic from that kind of a source, not that you
became a hu — better human being, but —
A: Yeah, yeah. And certainly, I’m not dealing with cows. And I often think, you
know, in a perverse way, I guess I can thank Hitler for me choosing another career,
at least.

Q: — come the first —
A: Who knows?
Q: — the n" generation of a new cow [indecipherable]
A: Maybe. And — and you know, that’s a pretty profitable business.
Q: That’s right.
A: Even though I’ve become a vegetarian, that’s the other thing. And I think that’s
why I’m still here, so.
Q: Okay.
A: Pm—T’ma-—I’m sort of a— I’m not an Orthodox, religious vegetarian. I
sometimes become a flexitarian.
Q: I like that term.
A: My mother, who — my daughter, who is visiting me in about three days, is a
vegan, so I almost cringe when I see her —
Q: Okay. Well, you’ve taught me new —
A: — prac — practice her — her — compared to mine.
Q: Well, you’ve taught me two new words, flexitarian and memoroid.

A: Yeah, and memoroid. Okay, well they aren’t — I can’t take originality — maybe I
can for the flexitarian, yeah. The memoroid, my wife pointed out. She heard
someone else tell me, so.
Q: Okay. Well —
A: Yeah.
Q: — once more, thank you. And I will say that, with that, this concludes —
A: Well, I appreciate it very much, having the limelight, my God, and — and you are
very — and both of you are very adroit.
Q: Thank you.
A: Now, what happens to —
Q: Hang on a second.
A: — these very powerful words that you’ve recorded?
Q: Well, what happens is that, as — they go on the internet, unless you wouldn’t
want it there.
A: Oh, they go on the internet, okay.
Q: But it goes on the internet through the museum’s website, and you will get a
DVD copy as well.
A: Oh, that’s great.
