Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Jerzy Gléwezewski, on May 7, 2013 at the Kosciuszko Foundation in New
York City, and I would like to thank you, Mr. Gl6weczewski, for coming to speak
with us today. And I’d like to start the interview, like we always do, at the
beginning. I’d like you to tell us a little bit about yourself, starting with the date you
were born, the place you were born, and please pronounce your full name for us.
And Ill — then we’ll go from there.
Answer: All right.
Q: Okay.
A: My name is pronounced Jerzy Glowezewski, that’s in Polish. In English,
Glowczewski, to make it easier. And I was born in November 19, 1922, so 1am
over 90 now. And probably what we discussed with you is that I’m one of the last
living witnesses, not to the Holocaust, but to the times of the Holocaust, as
witnessed by many of us who had to escape, occupation of Poland was by the
Germans and the Soviets — Soviets. And we found ourselves in different parts of the
world.
Q: Well, let me interrupt for a second. That’s a wonderful introduction, and we will
go back even further, because we will get to that central part of the experience and
the reality of what the two different forces were, and how they played themselves

out in Poland. But let’s start far more individually. Tell me a little bit about your
family, your father’s name, your mother’s name, their occupations.
A: Well, my father’s name was Kazimierz Glowczewski, or Casimir in — in
English. And he was from an old family who was probably a landed gentry
sometime in the 18" century, our area. And they found themselves also refugees in
— in the 1770s, to Warsaw, when the part of the country in which they lived, which
is Pomerania on the Baltic shore, was taken over by the Prussians. And that was
the beginning of the big, tragic Polish history, was through stupidity of the rulers
and of the ruling classes, they run into the situation where the Poland was divided.
It was once a very —
Q: Large.
A: — flourishing Polish-Lithuanian kingdom, very large, enormous amounts of
territory, from the Baltic to the Black Sea almost, which was a magnet for many
foreigners who were written down as refugees or immigrants. Because Poland had
a unique in — in the European history, system of elected kings, and — and the
parliament.
Q: For the Middle Ages, unheard of.
A: Unheard of. Unheard of even during the later ages. So Poland was an open
country. I always compare it to America, although 300 years later, but 1t was a

country of immigrants. We had many, many nationalities, and foreigners as far from
Sweden, Scotland, Spain, tracking down, looking for freedom of location to live,
education, religion, and — and speech. It was — but that also requires some kind of
rules.
Q: Yeah.
A: And they — the — they were so e-e-enchanted with the freedom that they forgot
that there are rules also, they have to contribute something to thi-this country. So
they did not pay taxes, for instance, they did not care about the army. So the Polish-
Lithuanian army was minimal, in — compared to the neighboring countries like —
Q: You’re talking about the 18" century.
A: Eighteen — na — Russia. But this is why so many people were displaced during
the — and my family was one of those, on my father’s side. On my mother’s side,
entirely different story. My grand-grandfather was a Napoleonic officer —
Q: Oh my.
A: — who went to Moscow with the Polish-Lithuanian army, to occupy Moscow.
And they did, but then they were defeated by frost, and again quarrels among them.
So they retreated. My — my great-gran — grandfather was wounded on the present
Belarusian border, and was saved by some people who lived in a — in a landed
manor. Landed gentry in mano — manner. And returned to France when Napoleon

was gone already. And he was so di-disenchanted with the re — resurgence of the
royal family in France, that he returned back to Poland where he met all the other
people who were also some kind of revolutionaries, too.
Q: They were sort of like 19" century revolutionaries.
A: Yes, yes —
Q: Yes.
A: — well, Napoleon arose —
Q: We — 1858, yes.
A: — from the revolution.
Q: Right.
A: French revolution.
Q: Right.
A: So there was this spirit of — of revolution. And he brought his two out of his
three — his five children, he brought two sons to Poland. And one of my gra — my
mother’s father is — is the — is —
Q: Son.
A: —1s the son of that — is — yes, of one of these Frenchmen.
Q: Well you know what — one thing that strikes me right away, is that you can trace
back your family to — across two or three centuries. Not many people can.

A: Yeah.
Q: They know that there’s thi — so this must have been mo — something that you
learned about at home, you know, that your parents told you, that was in the air, that
— you know, how did you fi — how did it become known?
A: F-First of all, I collected all this materials from the family, and members who
were alive after the war.
Q: Okay.
A: And saved this in form of loose leafs, handwritten stories. And then I collected a
lot of photographs. I have at home many albums, which I redone, sa — taking back
the history of my family to 1840s. Why? Because our [indecipherable] story
unusual.
Q: Yeah.
A: In Warsaw, our house and our apartment survived the uprising and the war.
Q: No kidding?
A: Oh yes. So that’s why I return after the war.
Q: Okay.
A: Because my family was survived, and my mother, my — and — and th — the home
is here, our business, which was a big lithography, painting —
Q: Well, this I wanted to ask about you.

May 8, 2013
A: Yes?
Q: I— I wanted to — to learn more about how your family supported itself, whether
or not both of your parents worked, and — and tell us a little bit about that.
A: We — we had a— we — my parents met soon after — I think right in ’21, soon after
the big celebration after the — the victory of the — the Bolshevik war.
Q: Okay. Against the Bolsheviks.
A: Against the Bolsheviks, yes. And my father — I have a — photographs of him in
the uniform, on a horse, but — but I think he was released quickly, because he
inherited from my grandfather, a big lithography and — and painting works, one of
the biggest in Warsaw, who specializes in painting, scientific albums —
Q: What was it called, the company”?
A: Artistic lithography of Wladislaw(ph) Glowezewski.
Q: Okay.
A: My grandfather.
Q: Okay.
A: Was born in 1843, and I suspect that he was fighting 1n this 60 — in 1860s in this
— one of these crazy insurrections, where the Polish-Lithuanian area a — gentry
actually arose against the tsarist, you know, with pistols and sabers against the
Russian army. And so that was one of these tragic events in the history. Because

May 8, 2013
there is a big gap 1n his history, which I suspect that is — not to mention anywhere,
because it for — afraiding — yeah, they were afraid of talking about this, after the
[indecipherable] in °69, or something like that.
Q: Yes.
A: But I saw his photographs in some kind of a patriotic, you know, uniforms and
thing. So — so that’s — that’s — that’s this part of the story, but — so my father
actually inh — inherited all this business, very — one of the most well-noted painting
works, and, after the World War I, and he met my French mother, because all
[indecipherable] were French citizens from Napoleonic times.
Q: Oh, wow.
A: But all the women who married lo — lost their French citizenship. So men
maintained this. So, I have this French connection, which was our life, until
recently.
Q: Did you have siblings?
A: What?
Q: Do you have siblings?
A: I have one daughter, yes, here — here in New York.
Q: Excuse me, but do you — did you have brothers and sisters?
A: Oh, no, no, I’m — sibling, I’m sorry. Yes, I had one brother, but he died.

Q: Is he older or younger than you?
A: Younger, three years of — yeah.
Q: Okay, so he was born in 1925.
A: Yes.
Q: You were the oldest son.
A: Yes.
Q: The oldest child.
A: Yeah.
Q: How would you describe your childhood? Is that too ba — large a question? How
would you describe your childhood?
A: Childhood?
Q: Yeah.
A: Well, there were two phases. One was extreme pleasantness, and ease, and well-
being, after the World War I, because of my father’s ability to run this business
expanded. But unfortunately, he was killed in a car accident on September 1“, 1929,
10 years before the war was — the second war.
Q: But you were just a boy?
A: I was a boy, seven years old, and of course, I barely survived this crash.
Q: You were in the car?

Interview with Jerzy Glowczewski "
May 8, 2013
A: Yes, I was in the car. And so, hard times arrived soon after, because next month
after this accident, the Wall Street went bust in New York. And since my father
had many, many business connections and plans and — and ec — of expansion, that
loans, bank loans, property bought on credit and all that, collapsed with the — with
the crash in New York; worldwide, grand dep-depression descended. And here is
really a—a very interesting, to me at least, the story of my mother —
Q: Yes.
A: — who did not have any special education. In fact, the World War I prevented her
from finishing her high school even, because as a French family, they were
evacuated from — from Poland to Moscow.
Q: To Moscow’
A: Yes, because they were French, and the Germans were coming and occupying
the Russian held territories in 1915.
Q: That’s right.
A: Until they — they stopped confronting the Russian army, and what they decided
that, let’s not fight any more, let’s make a revolution everywhere. But th-the French
citizens who were evacuated to Moscow stayed there until ’16 — 1916 - 717, but
then the revolution erupted in Russia, and they were again evacuated through the

[indecipherable] the northern sea, to France. And they came back to Poland in
1919. That’s where my father met my mother.
Q: Wow, it was fascinating even up til that time.
A: Yeah.
Q: So, your mother is — is faced with a very heartbreaking task in 1929.
A: Yes, she — she was a very beautiful young woman, surrounded always by elegant
men. And they returned to Warsaw in 1919-20, and met my father and began a
very happy life. And so I was born in — under that period, but, you know, few years
later, it — the tragedy struck, and my mother, against wi-wi — advice of everybody;
family and friends, and acquaintances well placed here and there, decided that she
will run the business herself. So she began to work alone as a worker in her own
establishment. From all the stages of production, you know, from the lowest
[indecipherable] and afternoon she was sitting on — behind my father’s desk, with
the accountant and business manager, and was learning how to run a business.
Q: Amazing.
A: Amazing.

which my mother was taking, and beginning in 1973, which I was taking. All these
albums survived the war, and are here —
Q: Wow.
A: — on 66" Street.
Q: What happened then?
A: Well, she pulled out an — an amazing feat of courage and — and goodwill from
people around, she saved the business, and actually established a very prosperous
life, and married for the second time in ’37, when she — when she was sure that
everything was going to work well. And —
Q: What was the name of her second husband?
A: [indecipherable] Zhontkoski(ph).
Q: Zhontkoski(ph)

to behave, how to —

A: Yes, very. Although, not really physically, but emotionally, yes. Because I was
lacking this paternal connection for — for seven, eight years.
Q: And th-these are crucial years in the development of a child.
A: And he came, and I was — I was a troubled boy, yeah, I was — I was not doing
well at school, I was kind of a little hooligan, I must say. And so, when he married
in 30 s — °37, in ’38, they — me and my brother were kicked out of the house, we
went to a Jesuit boarding school, which was —

Q: What kind of — yeah, what kind of memories do you have of the time that you
were there at that Jesuit boarding school?

A: It was a— a—a-—a-—almost a miraculous decision to sa — to save me, you know,
because I — I got straightened out. And it was just when the war broke out, when we
were — were on vacation after that first year with the Jesuits.
Q: So the war broke out after your first year of boarding school?
A: Yes.
Q: Tell me, how did the war — how did you learn about the war happening? That is,
when it happened, the day that it happened, where were you?
A: Well, prior to that moment, we were well instructed by our history teacher, who
sported a big scar on his cheek, like that. And the rumor was that he was serving in
the cavalry in ni — in — during the Bolshevik war. And he took part in a — last
probably in the history of mankind, cavalry charge between the Polish cavalry and
the Marshal Budyonny cavalry of —
Q: Of the Russians.
A: — of Russians.
Q: Yeah.
A: Who were moving from the south, from the Ukraine.
Q: Well, certainly for the 20" century.

A: The last — last cavalry, yes, charge.
Q: Yeah.
A: I think — I think several thousands — thousands of cavalry was involved on both
sides. So — so he was very much aware of the dangers of the war, and he, during his
history classes was explaining to us what the present situation and — and — may
bring. And one day in April ’39, we were gathered in the auditorium where we used
to have a theater productions and so forth, there was a lo — radio and the
loudspeakers connected, and we heard the announcement of the foreign minister
from the Polish parliament, the same refusal of accept Hitler’s request to give in to
the — to German reg — demand of some — some territorial — and we were, of course,
cheering in support, but this teacher told us, boys, you don’t know what is going to
happen, but everything is not going well. So you can cheer, and — so w-we — we had
the sense that somebody warned us, of course not — so we — the vacation came later,
in — on June or July, and we had the great time during vacation. And — and then
suddenly we were called back from the vacation on the — on the Baltic, on the
beaches, we were there, by — by somebody send a car with a driver, return
immediately and so forth. And — and as we were driving back, somebody bought a
newspaper and there it was, and I thi — this is — this is the date I know, it was
August 234, ’39, where there was a big news that the Hitler made a pact with the

Soviet Union that there will be no war between them. And that was the — the
invitation for the - Germany to invade. There will be no intervention of the
Soviets.
Q: Now, did that — did people understand that instinctively? When they saw the
news — [technical interruption, break] We — we were at — you find out — ah-ha,
my question was, you read in the newspaper about the agreement between Hitler
and Stalin, and did people instinctively then realize that this is bad for Poland?
A: I—I don’t remember how people — because we were ki — you know, I was 17
and a half, and there were two girls with me, and we were driving to —
Q: They’re much more interesting, of course.

Q: Yeah.
A: — or a week later, 23"? Yeah, eight days later, we were woken up at five o’clock
in the morning by the air — air raid sirens. And — and then, of course, I — we run on

and I saw one plane being downed. And then of course, we run to the — to the radio,
and there was this announcement that th-the war has started, and the president had a
statement, and my brother said no, it’s fine. We are not going to school. So that was
— that was the reaction.
Q: Yeah. And did you go back to school?
A: No, no.
Q: So you had only one year at that Jesuit school —
A: Yeah.
Q: — but it did what it needed to do.
A: They did, yes, yes, yes.
Q: Okay. So what happened —
A: And of course, all the — all the — all the drama that developed the next few days,
you know, the declaration of war by England, and France, and everybody was
looking at the plane, where are the French planes coming, where are the English
planes? Where — where is the aid, where is this, and so forth, how many days can
we do it alone? You know, this type of thing.

deteriorating physical situation around, people fleeing, you know, and roads full of
refugees, and so forth.
Q: What happened with your own family? How did things develop within your
family, and for you?
A: Well, there was a — there was a — a— an unfortunate, or fortunate, I don’t know,
uphill on the radio, some kind of a military person, pronounced that 1n order to
formulate new units of the army, all men able to bear arms should move east.
Q: Right.
A: Somewhere between Wilno and Lwow, on that border, since Soviets are not
going to interfere, and the new units will be formed there. And we need more
volunteers and so forth. So, we parked — unfortun — fortunately we had our cars, and
we parked this — and some friends, you know, and cavalcade of motorcars, full of
men. We left Warsaw at night. The roads were jammed, and my mother didn’t
want to go, and my — she kept — my brother was 14. Said no, I am here, I have a —

refugees, with chickens, goats, canaries in the cages, you know. On bicycle, and
motorcycles, on foot. It — it was a — it was a scene of complete chaos. Plus the
German planes were strafing and shooting on — to dec — on the columns of civilians
escaping. They were escaping nobody knows where. East. Most of them were later
caught by the Soviets and deported to Siberia.

dead people from the street, col — you know, this type of horror stories. We had no,

close, and they actually surrounded Lwow, so the gentleman in charge of our group
decided we have to move out quickly, because tomorrow the German will encircle
the — the city, and it will be it. So we left at three o’clock in the morning —
Q: Well, how were the Schiffmans(ph), were they — they must have been quite
nervous.
A: Oh, we — we asked Schiffman(ph), of course, to join us, he said no way, we are

Q: At — at this Zamos¢, at the place —
A: Oh yeah, well, we stopped on the markets square, which was actually empty. I
don’t know, maybe refugees were going the other way. Yes, because we diverted
from the main track where everybody was moving. We diverted to another place,
we had somebody to leave over there on the road, one of my uncles. And we were
look around, and then came a little Jewish boy with the — with the — with —
Q: Payos.
A: — side curls, yes, and — and had the white apron, and — and — and he said,
gentlemen, can I— you need — you need some help. Please step in, we have food, we
can wash and so forth. So we went to this corner, kind of a wine cellar, under the
arcades of very beautiful, gorgeous, historic city square. And I remember the — the
name was called Festendik(ph) in the Polish letters.

about my stepfather and — and him, he was inquiring, what — what does — what is
happening, what is happening? I don’t — we don’t have any paper, no papers,
nothing, no radio. Well, we think that we were escaping because the Germans are
behind us, you know. And — and — and then, when we were leaving, after you know,
refreshments and food, he didn’t want to accept any money. He brought a bottle of
Tawki(ph) which is an old, old musty, you know, dry — de — an ancient bottle. He
says, this is the oldest bottle I have in my wi-wi — cellar. Will you be kind enough to
drink with me this, you know? So we drank, too. And he says, remember me
always. And he didn’t want to leave. He said, look, this is ordained by the God, and

living in — close to the Slovak border already, or Romanian border. And
[indecipherable] and — and then we — we — we repaired old cars, and things like
that. I was making drawings of all these activities, and — and then Mr. Byger(ph)

so wi — they were told to evacuate to Romania, because the French are flying the
planes to Romania. Again, naiveté. So they lost all the — that — but these pilots were
with us, finally we’ve crossed the border when somebody came on a motorcycle
dressed half in the uniform, half in civilian. And he said, the Bolsheviks are over
there, 10 kilometers from here. I escaped. The Bolsheviks? So, then the commotion,
and the Romanians opened the border, and we crossed.
Q: So, until that point, they wouldn’t have done it?
A: Hm’?
Q: Until that point, they would not have —
A: I wa — no, because they’re the bo — this was like s — a small border crossing, not
used by many.
Q: Okay.
A: So they didn’t know what to do, and they were waiting for the telephone —
Q: Instructions.
A: — yeah, yeah. And so we were standing in front of that barrier, and the whole
column, couple hundred trucks, full of equipment, mechanics, and pilots. And this

Royal Air Force museum wanted to know, ho-how did you manage to get 15,000
Polish pilots in England in °43 - ’44?
Q: And it was —
A: While the French only had 300? I said, ask the French.
Q: And they — it was because they were able to cross the border at that time?
A: Because — because this was the only — the only segment of the Polish armed
forces who could — who was most precious, because they were very well trained,
with experience in fights during that two weeks of war, three weeks. And they were
immediately formed into squadrons in France, when they got from Romania. The
Romanians closed their eyes, looked the other way, and they all went by train,
through Yugoslavia and Italy, which was neutral still, to France. And some wents
to the Middle East. And later, an — a year later, I followed to the Middle East.
Q: So tell me, what happened to you, and your stepfather and whoever you were
with in the small group?

look — walk, and ask for someplace to stay. And there was a little — a young man
walking alongside, and — and talking something to — to them, in broken French. So
they said, no, no, no, they didn’t know what he was talking about, thought he was
begging, or something. But he was persistent, he was foreign, and they couldn’t find
any — anyplace. A hotel? Never — never heard of a hotel in Falticeni. And he was
saying — so they finally followed him, and he ca — they know that he was the son of
the owner of a beautiful, sort of bourgeois villa, with all these paintings, you know,
all the naked not — nymphs bathing in the streams, you know, flowers, you know,
thick gilded frames, crystal chandel — chandeliers.
Q: In the middle of such chaos and war.
A: Yes. And he — in this Falticeni, a very rich, local Jewish family gives us this
shelter because they son found us, and he considered that this is honor to do this,
and duty. And then they found it — we found this black woman housekeeper, who

Although they were living very well. Romania was rich with oil. The Ploiesti oil
fields, which we crossed, were pumping oil all the time, and that’s why Germans
finally occupied Romania, to get their oil. And Bucharest was amazing city, much
more — maybe not that historical, but much more beautiful than Warsaw, frankly. It
was planned very well, it had the Arc of Triumph on the — on the — on the big
square, like in Paris, you know, big avenues full of trees and st — 1-1t was — it was

They got visas. We were 1n contact with my uncles who lived in France then, my
mother’s brothers. And they were both in the ar — French army, but they were
writing very, very dramatic letters. They said th-the French do not want to fight. So
I —I don’t know what to advise you, frankly. It doesn’t look good here, so why
don’t you stay in Romania? And about New Year’s day, 1940, we finally received

stans — censorship and so forth, very vague about [indecipherable] said, we are
fine, I hope you are too. Let — let’s wait til spring, you know, this type of saying
stay there, do not come back. So we knew a little bit, but that was the last contact
we had with my family until five and a half years later. There was no — no — no way
to com — communicate. So we stayed. My father got involved with some kind of
intelligence work, with some Armenians from Lwow, I believe, who had contacts
with the — with the Soviet s-sphere of — so I believe that they were working on a —
what’s happening after the Germans invaded, or occupied Romania actually, after
the fascist school, and what was happening in the Soviet zone, and they were
contacting this Polish government in — in — in Paris, and then in London. There
was a ki-kind of network of spies, and Polish had — government had a very well-
established network there. So a friend of ours, who was one of those people before
the war, engaged my stepfather into this and some other people; I was kind of
witnessing these gatherings, were always very funny, very fancy, who dressed
around. But that was the cover of some meetings, which later, after the war, my

of his past, he was also in the inter — military intelligence in — in Italy, where the
Polish army came from the Middle East, yes.
Q: So you even started going to school there?
A: And then I — then we d — he discovered that there is a public school being formed
in Bucharest, and that’s where I went, because I still had two years to go before the

spring. The king abdicated, King Karl abdicated, and he f-fled with his mistress,
Madame Lupescu, which was known before the war, through all the newspapers,
all over the — Europe. And — and his son, Michael became the king. But he was
again — but he was already degraded in his power, and there was — the — the General
Antonescu, who was the military leader of this coup, and that’s where the — the —

my two friends, two girls who were Jewish in this school, and — and they wanted to
arrest us once, on the street, because we were assoc — we were — we were associated
with Jewish girls. And I have the names in the book.

Romania.

A: By the Polish government 1-in exile. Probably in London by then.
Q: So, if your stepfather was involved, does he — would he — did he have some extra
information?
A: He — he — he had — it was all organized for us, but it was — it could not have been
organized for everybody who was with us, because we left Constanta, which is a
port on the red — Black Sea, in luxury, on a — a cruise ship, Transylvania. And
there were about 600 people there, all Polish refugees. And we met many of them
whom we knew from Bucharest, from cafés, from streets, from cinemas, and so
forth. So, I —I still say this is one story that is not explored how this was organized,
this whole evacuation. Somebody bought the whole ship, and — and we didn’t have
any money. We were living in a very luxurious apartment, yes, with the Otis
elevators, electric then, and they had the Mercury car, Ford, waiting for us on the

again, six 0’clock in the morning on the station, and somebody gives a bag, and in

I find 600 people on that — on the boat. I made lot of sketches in my notebooks, of
these evacuees. It’s a caricatures I was drawing you know, what they were doing,

evacuation, a boat across the Bosporus. A villa on — on the shore of — Sea of

everybody to the station, railroad station on the Asiatic shore. Tickets for the — for

weeks there, again, sitting on the beach, eating oranges from the trees, a novelty.

you finish the school. He was accepted, although he had category D. But he was
some kind of clerk situation.
Q: Tell me, what does category D mean? Okay.
A: Un-Un-Un-Unsuitable for military service, probably.
Q: Oh, great.

A: Anyway, he was put in some kind of a clerical work, and I saw him very little,
except that he and — and this Polish officer of the intelligence, rented an apartment,
with two bedrooms. In one, I was sleeping, in the other, his young wife was
sleeping. And in the middle was kitchen and bathroom. On the [indecipherable]
street in Tel Aviv — in Tel Aviv. And that’s where we were living. He was coming
sometimes to visit us. He was already in Alexandria, I remember, in Egypt,

the high school, I — I followed — that I — I — that’s what I am describing in the book.

the shore of the sea. We didn’t know what was happening, but there was German
invaded Greece — Greece, you know? And so there was a — always that something
may happen. So we were defending British empire there, on the beaches of — near
Haifa. And — and later they packed us in the — in the train, and took us to
Alexandria, and nearby in the big camp of the Polish brigade, who was already on
the other side of Alexandria, on the west side, and here we on the — on the

was mostly marching in the sand — after that, many other sort of events, excursions

brigades against a crack Italian division of Bersaglieri. It was the famous
duches(ph) unit. They paraded by running. And — and that was — and actually,
actual — this — this action by the Polish brigade, opened the — broke the front line of
the German-Italian forces. So they retreated past Benghazi, and we were sent to —
to — to Sri Lanka, which is then shore — shore — shore area of — of Libya, where
there were a lot of agriculture lands, where the Arabs were expelled by the Italian
colonists who lived in the little huts. And that’s where we stayed. Ah, there were
many things of war I forgot about. Is — I spended fi — four, five months in the
desert, and then we were finally retre — rem — ordered to go back to — to Egypt,
because it was too long to stay on the front line.

suddenly there came an — an — an order to make a choice. Either you want to
continue the officers’ school, or you volunteer to go to England, to air f — to the air
force, to the paratroopers, or to the navy, whichever. One, two, three desks under
the stands. One hour time to think about it. Go.
Q: Did you have a chance to talk with your stepfather about what to do?
A: No, [had no contact with him.
Q: He was still back in isra — in Palestine.
A: He was in — in — in —1n Egypt later. I knew that he was in Egypt. But — but that
was the — th-the first decision which I had to make on my own, and I chose the air
force, but then somebody said, any questions? How are we going to get to
England? None of your business. You will get there. Just say yes or no, which way
you want to go, one, two, three choices. Military secret, nothing. So again, one
transit come, another transit come, then across the Suez Canal, to — to the Suez
port, another waiting few days, and then there are big ships in the harbor. What are
these? Well, these are this, they brought the British army for General Montgomery,

were given Italian rifles. What do you — what do we need Italian rifles? You will
find out on the bow of the ship. So we were — we — we approach the ship, it was like
that, like a skyscraper, what is — Queen Mary, which was completely empty,
because this Queen Mary brought 10,000 Scottish troops for General Montgomery
for this offensive, and it was going back empty. So what about this Italian rifles?
Because you have 1400 German prisoners which you took in Libya. You have to
escort them. Where? Don’t ask questions. No questions answered, yeah. And we
had 1400 young boys like ourselves, from the Rommel army. Germans. And you
know, and they were down on the — at the bottom of the ship, on the third class. We
were occupying second class, where they removed only the beds, and put the, you
know, bunks, so more people can sleep. And that was the luxurious trip on board of
Queen Mary.
Q: Did you have any interaction with them?
A: Well, s-some, because we went to south a — through south Africa, and then
across the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro. And we didn’t know why, but three of them
escaped from the ship in the Rio de Janeiro, and they were caught on the beach by
the Brazilian police, and they were brought back. So, there were some rough
moments when one of the — our sergeant, who was fluent in German, interrogated

mostly Australians, must have given them a big wrench, so they can — they opened
the screws of the —
Q: Portholes.
A: — portholes, yes, which were screwed in. So that was a first. But then, from Rio
d’aneiro(ph), we went along the af — Americas coast, to New York. We didn’t
know where are we going, it was all secret, but we ended up in New York. And we
unloaded the Germans here, and — on the lower Hudson, on Jersey City, again in
barges. And on those barges, when we were sailing with the — our segment of the
prisoners, now we began to — to smile at each other. You know, we were about 19 -
20, all a — both sides. So they had some piece of paper, they wanted an autograph,
and I had some photographs, and some drawings that they made, gave — given to
me, you know, as a kind of exchange. And we handed them over to the Canadians.
Put them in the elegant passenger cars, and took them to the prisoners’ camp in — in
Canada.
Q: My goodness.
A: And we stayed for two weeks in — in — in — in New York, having a ball,
absolutely ball. We were the first unit of 300 Polish ar — uniforms men, for the first

this, for dinner, for a dance, and — and we stayed for just two weeks, and then sailed
on — on — in a big convoy, and then I decid — discovered that there are oh,
Americans on these ships. And then we — we — when we learned that America is in
war. And that was summer of ’42.
Q: America was in the war —
A: Since December 41.
Q: That’s right.
A: When — when — when we entered Tobruk, the officer told me, by the way,
America was attacked by the Japanese somewhere, the Pacific, and America will
join the war, hooray. And that was it. And then secrets. Nobody, no newspapers,
nothing, until New York, where I found out that America is in the war, because 11
huge ships were taking troops to — to England.
Q: Now, amongst the recruits that were with you, were any of those original Polish-
Jewish young men also part of this?
A: I’m sure they were, yeah. Now — now, there were 50 of us from the officers’

the General Sikorski and Stalin made a deal that Poland will help, if you release
the prisoners. That was before Katyn was discovered. But this young guys were
from — from — mostly from gulags and from prisoner camps. A-And we started to
talk to them on that fantastic journey from Rio de Janeiro to New York, you know,

A: Well, he — he talk — it took us 15 days. Thi — this whole sea strip from Suez, via

notes, and dates, and what happened then. Nothing important, but just as a
reference. I still have it.
Q: Do you still have the notebook?
A: Yes, yes, yes. This 1s only the — the trip, you know, the — the sea voyage. Well,
we were a big sensation for the American troops on that troop carrier, because they
were young boys like us, going for the first time to Europe, abroad, you know?
They were from Kansas somewhere, from Missouri, you know, soldiers, G.Ls.
And we were sleeping in hammocks because everything was removed to make more
room for troops, you know, this — on these transport ships. And eleven big ships,
and the escorts, two cruisers and several destroyers, on — on all sides, cruising all
here, you know, watching for the submarines and U-boats. So it was a
[indecipherable] pleasant, but mostly Americans were telling us, how is it in the
war? What do you do? You know? And we didn’t want to talk about the war,
frankly, we were enjoying the — the — the — the — the trip. So, you know. But I — I
learn how to jitterbug on that ship. I met many American soldiers who were trying
to say a prayer in Polish, you know? They remember what their grandmother what
told — told, you know? Terribly moving. Which I — moving now, but at that time,

and well, we were only 300, so there was some — somebody more than — than us.
And then we went directly to Scotland, to a camp near [indecipherable], in
northern Scotland, and we stayed there 10 days or something. We soon discovered
that every church has a dance hall, and twice a week there were dances at the
church hall, where you could meet a lot of lonely girls. But mostly we were being
interviewed. Not us, from the brigade, where we were — had all our papers and army
books and so forth, but mostly those who came from the Soviet Union. They were
grilled again and again, who they are. Later, later, after the war I discover
[indecipherable] you don’t know why, because the — the — the army intelligence
wanted to know who these people really are. There was no time to interview them

on the boat, and came. But the — the army wanted know exactly who they are, like —
like you are asking me now. Where they came from, the addresses and —
Q: Right.
A: — father —
Q: Right.
A: — and mother and so forth, you know, for security. Because there was already a
we — awareness that many, many Soviet agents could be smuggled this way.
Q: Yes.
A: So, they already knew that. So we stayed there, and then finally they — we were
separated into various arms forces, units that we volunteered for. Those for the air
force, those for the navy, those for the parachute brigades, and — and — and — and we
parted in different places of — and that’s where I begun about almost a year and a
half training in various, as it was called, stations of — of the air force. It was all
manned by the Polish ar — air force already, all instructors, all teachers. Except the
teachers of English were — were Polish people. And then it — it — it took us about
that time to — to reach the — the — the level where we could be transferred to — to the

and a half were people you first might have met at the Romanian border, as you
were fleeing Poland?
A: No, no, no.
Q: No.
A: It was such a mixture of — of people, mixing all the time. But I always had very
good friends, and one of my best friends was a Ludwig Gutmeier(ph), speaking
about the Jewish people, who was with me from — from the time the brig — I didn’t
know him at the time we were in — in Libya. We met on the boat, actually, in that
group. And he was a son of a — of Aba(ph) Gutmeier(ph), a very well-known art
dealer, and collector of Polish art, maybe better than this, in Warsaw. And he had a
sister, whom he adored, he had a picture of — of her sister, was showing. And he
escaped Warsaw during the, actually, German siege and bombardment, which
means about 10 days after me. How he managed to — to escape, I don’t know.
Because frankly, we never talked about this. Never. The discussions were about
today, right now, and what we are going to do tomorrow. But never — never

that’s the lesson, but — which I learn only recently, when I started to write this — this
— this — this books, this memoirs, were 50 years after the war when I started.
Q: Why? Why did it take so long?
A: I never — I was never interested in — in — in — in— while I was collecting all the
photographs, all the drawings of all these wanderings after the war — I saved
everything, without even thinking about it. It was only the first Polish book, there
were three books, these are condensed three books here. It was printed in Poland in
2003, and I probably started this writing about 2000, year 2000.
Q: Yeah, 55 years after the war.
A: And nobody ask me anything, and I don’t — didn’t ask anybody after the war,
and I came to the d— completely destroyed city, Warsaw, and we’re planning how
to spend the night — dancing night, you know? But nothing about — nobody told me
about the horrors of they went through, uprisings, and so on, the destruction,
prisoner camps. Nobody. So this Ludwig Gutmeier(ph) was this very good friend,
and he was with me on this first preliminary stages of tra — air force training, but at
one — one point, he said ah, you know, it takes so long. I want to — I want to — I
want to bomb the Germans. Said, how you going to do it? He said, well, I— you

bombers, there is a guy who looks at the target and pushes the button. I want to be
that guy. So he left area, because that was much more shorter training. And I met
Ludwig after the war, in Paris, where we spent a very exciting time. And in 1961,
when I came on the Ford Foundation visit to America, on my second day in New
York, I met him face to face on Madison Avenue here. Yeah.
Q: Amazing. Amazing. So, what were you trained for, and what was your job on the
plane?
A: I was pilot, fighter pilot. Which means, I was alone. My job was everything. And
I was trained to be a speed fighter pilot. And I was posted soon after the D-Day to a
Polish wing which consisted of three squadrons, 36 planes in France, on a field trip
— airstrip. And we were in so-called tek — tactical air force, which means we were
supporting the ground troops. If you saw “Private Ryan,” there is a — there is a shot
where airplanes are flying very low over this loop of Americans who are trying to —
to — to escape the encirclement. Well, that’s what we were doing. Air support to the
ground troops, and — and bombing from the dive — dive bombing.
Q: Okay.

few and — and sparse in those days, because the Luftwaffe was already — had the

broken back, during the Battle of Britain, and following years. Last October, I was
in Washington, I was asked by the museum of the RAF in London to be a keynote
speaker on a yearly gala they have in Washington, in Willard Hotel, which is the —
the luxury hotel, you know, on Pennsylvania Avenue. They have a yearly banquet
— gala banquet for the f-foundation a — foun — American foundation of the Battle of
Britain, where they are collecting money to build a monument at the museum in
London to the pilots who fought the Battle of Britain, in 1940 - ’41. And this was a

my friend Steve, air chief marshal Sir Steven Dalton, who sat next to me in all this
gala, gilded things and medals, the commander of the Royal Air Force of today,

who came to England in 1940, those who were emi —
Q: At the border.
A: — at the border, whom I ma — who were shipped immediately to England and
France, and later to England, we would not win this battle, he said, because our
numbers were dwindling. We had pilots after 15 hours in the plane, sent to this

Q: How many missions did you fly?
A: Hundred.
Q: A hundred?
A: Yeah, just hundred, yes.
Q: And do you — over what territories?

Kazik(ph) Becker(ph). There is the photograph of him, and he had this name of his
sister chalked on his cowling, you know.

A: I had couple more Jewish pilots, yes. Th-Th-They were in every squadron, there
was Jewish and like that.
Q: What was your last bombing mission?

there were Canadian force, and — and British, moving on the northern front.
Americans were further south. And the Polish armored division, the tanks, arrived
at Wilhelmshaven, which is the main base of the German Kriegsmarine.
Q: Okay.
A: Built in — in imperial time, and — and it was the — we were prepared to support
the — the — the attack of this British armored division on Wilhelmshaven, which
already surrounded by the Polish army. When I made my hundredth, and that was
the end of my tour — the tour was 50, that was my second tour. So you would — you
don’t fly tomorrow. Pack up, you can go. You have tickets and all that. And I was
very happy. But then, th-the next few days, they started this bombardment, and —
and it — and it — the war ended soon after that [indecipherable]. So — but — but — but
the capitulation of Wilhelmshaven was accepted by the Polish kal — kalner(ph) of
— of the arms division.
Q: That must have been satisfying.
A: And this is an amazing coincidence because the war started in Gdansk, by the
bombardment by Schleswig-Holstein, the German battleship of the Polish outpost
in Gdansk called Westerplatte, with W. And the war ended Wilhelmshaven with
the Polish troops bombarding the Wilhelmshaven. An [indecipherable]
coincidence.

A: Well, it — it — it — I was — I left this quadrant in April, and they were still flying
til they — til the first days of May, when the armistice was. And from — by that time,
I was in Paris already, with my uncle.
Q: So here — here’s another question. Of those hundred mission — hundred missions,
were there any that you felt more in danger than in others, or were each — all of
them equally alike?
A: Well, th-the — there were not all, because you know, sometimes you were going
on a patrol, very high up, escorting American bombers, the flying fortresses, few
times. But most of the real danger was because we were coming down on German
positions, which were very heavily defended by the anti-aircraft guns and machine
guns. And when you were coming down there, everybody was shooting at you. So it
was touch and go. And sometimes we are flying two and three missions every day.
Q: My gosh.
A: Because we were very close, you know, it lasted one hour. You took off, one
hour you were over the [indecipherable], you bomb, you — you come down, you —
you shoot, and you come back. So it was — it was a lot of the sum — you were —
found bullets in the fuselage. A couple friends were killed sa — many were killed

into shape after — after having been a troubled teenager, and when the war ended,
you were — you were a fighter pilot with a hundred missions under your belt. Were
you the same person? How had the war changed you?
A: No much. No, but in between, I had two years of the refugee schools in
Bucharest and Tel Aviv.
Q: Okay.
A: Which were a salvation, because since that time, I did not read a single book
during the war. There was no way. I read some English books when I learned. But
aft — when I arrived in Warsaw after the war, and wanted to join the school of
architecture, I was accepted without any tests, or anything. But my — my level of
education was zero, I must tell you frankly, zero. Because I did not have full cycle
of education like normal school. So I—I-—Is-—I suppose I learned myself.
