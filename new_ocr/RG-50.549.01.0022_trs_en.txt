have grandchildren so | am even more overprotective. But now we talk about it. As
soon as my kids, my grandchildren, not to my children. They start to go to school
and of course it came out, schools talk about it. | was able more to talk about it.
They called me, there's not, my children live in Connecticut and when they started
High School, even, when public schools they wrote about their
grandma. In schools, and I'm sure you know that they say, you know, you have
grandparents? Tell me about you're grandparents. They always say that my
grandparents are survivors but | don't know much about them. They called me into
Connecticut, to schools. | talked a little bit about it. | told them. They wrote about
my life. They always got A's, always got A's. When they graduated, my older one's
bar mitzvah, and it was like some kind of a Friday night, they called me, | went
there. | told them what | would like to do. They brought the whole school children.
| told them that | want to tell them how lucky they are that they were born here and
raised here and educated here. They didn't have to go through what grandma went
through. And how overprotective | am over them. With both boys | did that, both
boys. And really they take pride in me. They take pride in me for that.
Q: Let's talk about you're children and you're family life a little bit later on. Let's go
back to the stories that...
A: To the ghetto?
Q: . . . now you're beginning to talk to them about these stories. Why don't we
start?
A: Start to talk about the children?
Q: Yes, start when you were a child. Let's talk of you're experiences in the ghetto
and just give, first of all, you're name then, how old you were, and a little bit about
you're family and then we can talk about the ghetto.
A: Okay. Actually the war for me started in 1939 when the Russians came in. In
1939. | was born in 1928. My name then was Fagel Giterman. Fagel was my
Jewish name, Giterman was my father's name. A family of five, my father, my
mother, three children. I'm the oldest of the three. My brother was one year
younger, my sister five years younger. Also lived with us a grandma, my father's
mother, who was an old, lovely lady. And in 1939, when the Russians came our
lives started to change. My father was a barber, he gave the kids a good
education, he worked very, very hard. My mother never worked. In Europe, in
those years, women didn't work. They took care of the children and we lived in a
small stet-ill (ph) by the name of Lock-mul (ph), not far from Pease (ph), from Mun-
yeah-yetz (ph), it's a stet-ill (oh) but a nice stet-ill (ph), with a beautiful you-gont
(ph), beautiful, beautiful young crowd of people which, | didn't even know them yet

because | was what? | was born in 1928 and this was 1939, | was eleven years
old, right? About eleven years old. And the war started already. They sent us to
school. They put us like a year younger. | felt as a child that life started to be hard.
Anyway, two years the Russians were there. It wasn't too bad. Then, in 1942 |
think, the Germans came. As a child, | was a curious child. | use to, we had a
radio. Some people didn't have a radio, we did have a radio. We use to sit, my
father use to sit by the radio and listen what's going on the world. And | was hiding
and listening. | was unhappy. | was very unhappy. It made me very unhappy. |
cried a lot. Then they started to talk about they are going to go to a ghetto, they are
going to put us in a ghetto. We lived like, we had our own house, and we lived like
outskirts of my town. And they are going to put us like in the middle of the town.
They divided the ghetto, this is only what I've heard talking from the grown-ups.
Like their going to divide the town, not the town, but in the middle of the marrick
(ph) they use to call it, middle of the city or the town or the stet-ill (ph), and they're
going to put us in the ghetto. | remember what they gave us, a buggy and a horse.
They didn't give us, my father had to borrow it from the next door, a peasant, non-
Jewish people. But they had a good pull you put on it and | walked in the back. |
looked at my house. | cried. | remember like now. This was 1942, | must have
been fourteen | guess. | cried my eyes out. | looked to the house. | said, "where
are we going"? Anyway, they took us there. My father had a stepbrother in this
particular ghetto. There were two ghettos split in half and we were in one ghetto,
not far from the Shul (ph). And he had a big house, but they gave us a small room.
And this small room, very small, tiny, maybe, my father made bunk beds. And
there were five people, and my grandma was six, and they put another couple
there, an elderly couple, and they also had like a bunk bed. And that's how we
lived there. We were there from, it must have been around Pacer side (ph), before
Pacer side (ph). So Pacer (ph) is usually April sometimes, the end of April
probably. And | didn't know, there wasn't enough food. | heard my father talk about
trying to get together a young group of people that, they are going to make like an
uprising and they are going to go to the other ghetto. | was always kind of, as a
child | was hiding and crying and hiding and reading whatever | could put my hands
on, some books, reading. And my mother never talked a lot. She was a nice, quiet
lady. My father was a barber and he was a good barber. And him | think, and the
guy, the other couple that was with us, they opened up a barbershop special for the
Germans and also for the non-Jews outside of the ghetto. And he worked there.
So he use to bring in, probably smuggling, hiding, a piece of bread, a piece of fish
or a piece of because whatever the ration they gave to you it wasn't
enough. | remember after quite a while, my mother's walking around with a pair of
swollen feet. | said, "Ma, what is it?". "Oh, nothing my kin, nothing. Don't worry
about, I'm fine." Later on | found out it was from lack of food. She didn't eat.
Whatever little food she had she gave it to the children. And she didn't eat it, she

got swollen. She was only thirty-six years when she went to her grave. When they
killed her. Thirty-six years old. And then old grandma was with us. | was never in
the kitchen. | was never, there was one kitchen, it couldn't have been for ten
family's maybe, | was never in somebody else's rooms. | couldn't, | was just in
pain, pain, pain, pain. | couldn't, | was mainly in my room. | don't even remember
playing with children. | don't know why. | was just trying to get books and read and
read and stay in bed and read. There was no school, of course. | never went to
school there in ghetto. And my little sister, | don't remember. | can visualize them
very well now, but | never went to school in ghetto. Maybe there was some school,
| don't think so, if there was any schooling there. And one day, they use to send
people to work. What was the work? Later on | found out, at the end. That they
use to take a bunch of people from on ghetto, send them to a different, out of town
place or out of this, to another town, dig graves and that's how they use to kill the
people. They didn't know about us. They wanted my mother, my mother was a
very brave woman, and one German was like after my mother. So instead of
sending my mother to work, work means to dig the graves for other people, | went.
| went to dig these graves and | remember the graves, they was like long, deep
graves. | was in one grave, digging, and there were some other people digging,
and on the way back they brought us home in trucks. And it was like in the middle,
this work was always done like in the middle of the night, like from suppertime
around, before it got dark, until like the middle of the night.
Q: Did you know what you were doing?
A: No. | really didn't know what | was doing. Because I, | had a hunch maybe, but |
really didn't know. | had no choice. Whatever it was | had to dig the grave, | wasn't
the only one. Not directly, | didn't know that this is really for killing people, to throw
people in there. And we came home, it must have been about 4 or 5 o'clock in the
morning. The ghetto was already rounded, all around. There were trucks, there
were soldiers. It was like, the ghetto was barb wired all around and we looked
around and one German said, "Well, you're going to be killed tonight." And the
people that were with us, they said, "This is it. | think we're going to get killed
tonight." They dropped us off. We went into the ghetto. Everybody was up, it
started to get like a little lighter, everybody was up. My mother was up. Everybody
was crying and screaming. But they didn't take anybody yet on the trucks yet. |
said, "Where's my Dad?". Dad wasn't there anymore and my brother wasn't there.
And | couldn't stand the crying, the yelling, the screaming. So | went out of the
house and, excuse me for the expression, to go to the bathroom they had like
booths outside. And you go into that booth and it was like a hole with a seat in
there so when they dropped this came down, and | hid there. | hid, that's why,
when | saw Shindler's List, | saw myself, that little girl. That little girl who dropped in
the, excuse me, in the droppings of the people. | was there. And when | saw this, it

just, | was screaming. | was yelling, | was crying. When | saw the movie. It's true, |
was there. And | went in like halfway, | just wanted to drown and | couldn't drown.
All of a sudden, my mother came running after me, grabbed my hair, pulled me out
and said, "You can't do that, you can't do that." | said, "Ma, | can't go on that truck.
| don't want to be killed. | can't do that." Anyway, she schlepped me into the
house, she washed me off and | hid under the pillows. | went into bed and | hid
myself. | covered my eyes and | put this blanket over my ears. She said, "No, you
come out of there." She schlepped me out of there. She dressed me and she put
some clothes on me and she says, "Listen, my child. You're father and you're
brother went to the other ghetto. They might survive. They might not survive. But |
want you to go there. Get dressed fast." She dressed me, she put some shoes on
me, she put a school thing on me and | started to run to the other ghetto. Now why
didn't | say, "Ma, come with me."? Why didn't | say it to my sister? She was
running after me. She said, "Take me with you." | said, "| don't know where I'm
going, | don't know where I'm going."

[Mrs. Eisen overwhelmed at this point, unable to make out what she is saying]

She continues: Who's going to take care of you're sister, my great grandmother,
old grandma." She said, "You go. Maybe you'll save yourself, maybe." Anyway, |
started to run. The ghettos were closed, they wouldn't let me through. | started to
beg, "Let me through, let me through. My father's there." So one guy opened the
gate, | was the last person crossing from one ghetto to the other. And they opened
the gate, | crossed the street, the only one, and they wouldn't let me in there. So |
started to scream and banging and knocking and they let me in. | went into the
other ghetto, ten minutes later the ghetto exploded, like exploded. They started to
shoot into the ghetto. The houses were on fire. | saw my first cousin, he lived in a
house in the other ghetto, in the Rabbi's house, | saw the Rabbi standing, wrapped
in a talus (ph), his little children next to him, with their heads up. My cousin, her
mother was in the back yelling, "Schmish-oil, Schmish-oil, Schmish-oil" (ph). There
was another guy next to him burning, on fire. And they started the shooting. The
shooting came in like a hail. | didn't see my father. | didn't see my brother. | didn't
see anybody. All of a sudden, | got killed. | got killed, | fell and | see people, | look
around me. | see people lying dead with open mouths. Children, blood, flesh,
pieces ripped apart. And I'm just laying there. | said, | touched myself, | said, No,
I'm alive. I'm not dead. | fell, | don't Know why, but | fell and | touch myself. | got up
and a bunch of young, Jewish guys, | think you have it on the record, somebody
who was in the front there, ripped the gate and they started to run through the town
into the gardens, straight to some woods. Everybody ran. | was running, | was
running, | was strong. | got weaker. | still didn't know what happened to me. And |
was running. | was running after everybody, I'm looking, maybe I'll see my father,
my brother, nobody. | Knew my mother's not there, this | knew. And | passed my

house, we passed the house where | lived in, | looked at it. And | ran. And we
came to a place by the name of Prepitch (ph) and | said to myself, there's
something running in the back of me. There's something not right about, my
shoulders are getting weaker, I'm getting dizzy a little bit. | said, my back is wet.
And | looked, | touched my back, my behind, and I'm full of blood. A girlfriend who
lived next to us came over and she looked at me and said, "Fanny, you know you
are wounded. What's the matter?" | said, "I don't know." She said, "You're whole
wet back is ripped, the clothing is ripped, | could see an open flesh there." | said,
"Well, | must have got hit in the ghetto by a, you know, when they hit me." She took
off her kerchief from her head, she took off her shirt, she had that little shirt
underneath. There was water there, the name of the place called Prepitch (ph).
She dipped this in the water, she wiped me around, she cleaned me off and she put
this around me and | was okay. | mean, there was a wound there. | didn’t know
anything else anymore. And that's it. And | was on the Prepitch (ph), unfortunately
people are cruel, | guess when the Mo-ha-movis (ph) is in front of you you're trying
to save yourself not somebody else. And the grown up people took off. Nobody
wanted me. | was very skinny. | didn't look like, | was thirteen-and-a-half | think,
nobody wanted me. | was running after the young males, you know, they said, "My
sister, my brother, my father, my mother, they are going to die and | can't schlep
here with me, | can't save my own life. Go home." | said, "What do you mean go
home, the ghetto was on fire, where am | going to go? | can't go anyplace, it's
burning. Where am | going to go?" Anyway, | was on my own there with some,
one guy who had two small children of his own took me under his arms. And
another two kids, they are all alive, he died, never, he shouldn't have died, he
should have lived forever. And he got in touch with some kind of peasant guy. We
were there for about a week on this Prepitch (ph), for about a week. Do you want
me to...?
Q: So how many people, let me just go over, when you left there, when you ran
from the ghetto, how many people were you with? Were there many people
running?
A: Running, they were running for about, out of the Prepitch (ph) there must have
been around 500 people who ran away from the ghetto.
Q: And did people scatter? Did you go.. .?
A: But they scattered all over the places, all over the places. Some, then quite a
few weeks later, | was traveling, we had to cross the Prepitch (ph) with some kind
of a kayak or something, otherwise we couldn't be over. And this guy who took me
under his wings, he had two small kids of his own, one is my age and one a bit
younger. And he said to him, "Well, if you're going to take care of ;
you're going to us a little bit. | have like a big pot of gold hidden behind

my house. When the war is over, I'll give it to you." It's true, he gave it to him, but
this poor peasant got killed for saving Jews. They killed him. And we were there
for about eight days. This peasant use to come, like everybody took off in different
directions, nobody wanted the kids. I'm talking about the Jewish people. Nobody
wanted us. And he use to bring, every day, like a little fish, cooked fish. A small
piece of bread. It must have been for about 7 or 8 kids there and this grown-up
man. And this is how we survived this Prepitch (ph). And then he said, "Over
there, on the other side of the Prepitch (ph) there are partisans. I'll take you there,
but one ata time." It was like a kayak, a metal kayak. And he started to, one day,
like a week later, with that whole week. And the Germans was looking for us.
There was one incident. We were laying, all of us together, in the woods. | lost my
shoes when | was running, my feet were swollen. At that time they take off, like the
corn, and it is so hard, it's like needles. And when you run, when | was running, it
like went through and through my feet, and my feet were huge and swollen. And it
was cold already, it was September | think, it must have been September. When
did they take off the corn? September, right? After the ghetto already, you know?
So, it was the end of September, or October, no, September, the end of September
| think. And he says, and | was laying there hungry and some kids were swollen
already too, and he said, "I'll take you over there." And he took like two, three
people on this little kayak and he took us over on the other side. Little by little, it
must have been about 7 or 8 kids. This grown up man, and he should rest in
peace, he saved my life. Because nobody wanted me. My own people, they knew
me. "Why are you running after me? Go back to you're mother." | said, "I don't
know where they are. It's burning, how can | go back there?" Twice they left me
sleeping. | shouldn't say it but it's the truth. They left me on a stack of hay. | wake
up in the middle of the night, there's nobody there. I'm laying there all by myself, on
the Prepitch (ph), I'm laying there all by myself. | got up. It's dark. Where am |
going to go? | don't know, so | was listening quietly. I've heard some talking but |
didn't Know for sure if it was German or Yiddish, but at that particular point, |
couldn't care less. So | figured if it's Germans, they kill me, it's enough. If Jewish,
let's see what's going to happen. | followed the voices and | got it there. It was the
same people who left me laying under the stack of hay. Twice like this | survived,
twice.
Q: How did you meet up with you're father again?
A: This was quite weeks later. | was laying in some woods. Some people went
away, some people got connected with some other groups. There was a lot of
traveling Jews from different towns. Some grown-ups. They knew the way and
they went to look for partisans. | was laying there with another woman and she
had, like a little child, a little boy. And | think this, Romanofski's (ph) his name, with
the two girls. We were laying there in a ditch in the woods, and of course | had a lot

of hair, | had long hair. Skinny | was all my life. And now, after weeks of not eating,
| could hardly move. We were laying there. "Mommy's dying." All of a sudden we
hear, some people hear some talking, either Yiddish or German. So we gave up,
figure, look, whoever is going to be there, it's going to be there. If it's going to be
Jews, fine. If not, if it's Germans, you're going to be dead. They are going to shoot
us out like worms in this ditch and put us there, you know, get it over with. And they
came closer and closer and closer. | can hear now, the echo in my head. And they
were Jewish. And this Jewish, and there was a man, just a man. A few men.
There was a woman with one child, | think, too. And they came closer and | looked.
| didn't know if my father ran. | knew he was in the ghetto where it was the uprising,
but | didn't know if he ran away or he survived or he got killed running. Nobody saw
him running, you know, and nobody knew if, nobody saw him. | mean, | didn't see
anybody. All of a sudden | see my father. | start yelling in Yiddish, "De-tock-n-key,
de-tock-n-key (ph)". He backed it up and he looked, he didn't recognize me. He
said, "De-tock-n-key?". "Don't you recognize me? It's Fagel, you're daughter." He
just didn't recognize me. He grabbed me and touched me and opened up the hair
over my face, took it away, and looked at my face and he started yelling, "No, this is
not my Fagel." And he passed out. | said, "Oh my God, finally | found him and now
he got a heart attack and he died." He didn't recognize me. He just didn't
recognize me at all, | was like a skeleton. And lots of hair, the hair was all coiled,
like all over my face. And he passed out. He passed out, of course, we started to
yell and scream and put some, there was no water there. | remember we use to
squeeze down our food and take some moisture out of it and that's what we drank.
We survived, we didn't get poisoned. And that's what we did, and we tried to, and
he woke up and he recognized me, of course. And this is how he found me, this is
how he found me. And then he said he knew his way a little bit around and he said,
"Well, let's see what you can do now." And we started to walk. And in the morning,
when it was light, the peasants, they go to the fields. It was field time. And they
leave the house open. So we use to go into the house, grab a piece of bread, you
know, steal. Steal a potato. Sometime we went in, like during the day we would
pass by some fields and this was like September, there were like beets and
potatoes and carrots. So we use to steal from the fields and sometimes we stole
from the houses. If we saw a house standing there, nobody was there, we ran in
and we stole a piece of pancake, whatever it was on the table. And this is how it
was for quite a while, for quite a few months. And then my father had a profession.
He asked me if my brother was running too. He thought maybe he was running out
of the ghetto, maybe he survived. All his life he was looking for him, but he didn't
survive. Later on we found out what happened to my brother. He was running. He
ran from the ghetto. He got wounded very, very badly. Worse than me. And a
German caught him and he said to him, "Run. Maybe you could save yourself.
Run." My brother was working in a stable with horses in the ghetto, so he use to

bring in like little things from an orange, a piece of bread. And these Germans
recognized him. And he started to run and he was weaker and weaker and weaker
and he came to, like close to my house where he was born, and the peasants
recognized him. And believe it or not, they finished him off with sticks. They killed
him with sticks, they finished him off with sticks.
Q: At this point how much information did you have when you found you're father
again and between .. .?
[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]
A: ... to my ghetto. When | walked out of there, when | went out of that ghetto,
what they did. Like | digged graves for other towns. They, some other towns dig
graves for my hometown. And what they did, they put all those people on trucks.
Whoever survive. In my ghetto there was not killing, | mean, in the ghetto, there
was no fire there. What they did from my side of the ghetto, they took those people
like my mother, my sister, my grandma, my aunts, my uncles, they put them on
those trucks. They took them to this grave. They put them, they lined them up
close to the grave. They told them to put their clothes off and, an old lady of over
eighty years of age. Why? You ask why? They took off their clothes, they shoot
them and they threw them in, like rows and rows. They threw in one row, they put
this disinfectant stuff, | don't know what it is, like a white type of thing, they put it
over, then another. They killed another row of Jewish, all, they had to get
undressed. And shoot them out, throw them into this grave. This was going on.
Whoever was there, there must have been about 2 1/2 thousand people. | think in
these grave, | think in this grave, there is about 1,900 people in this grave.
Q: When did you, how did you find out this information? When did you find that
out?
A: After the liberation, after the liberation. My father also knew, like through the war
we didn't know exactly, but my father knew from some peasants. They saw it.
They were standing there watching. There was a lot of peasant people standing
and watching. And they saw exactly what they were doing. But, either they were
afraid of their own skin or they were happy about it and they didn’t care. And what
could they do if they did care? They'd shoot. But they saw something like this
going on, they could have been dead too. If they would say one word for the Jews,
he would have been dead too, the peasant. And that's, they finished it off. They

there. The peasants didn't touch, they had the goym (ph), they were afraid to come
close to it, | don't know. And we started to clean it up and we put it in bags and
then | saw little bones and | took off. | took off. I left my hometown. | lived in

Russia. So | was like on the Polish side of the border. And Swooz-ka (ph) was on
the other side. And | was liberated there, in Swooz-ka (ph).
Q: Let's talk about liberation. What were you doing? You were with you're father?
Tell me about what you were doing, what they daily life was like leading up to
liberation?
A: Well we were walking. We were looking actually for the partisans because the
peasants said that there are partisans. And being my father was a barber and he
knew a little bit how to sew, he didn't have ammunition on him. And we were
Jewish. And we had no other choice. | mean, we walked and we came across
some groups and, say they were partisans, and he got in touch with them, he got
connected with them. And they said, well, they'll take in my father. At first, like the
partisans in that area, they were organized from Moscow. They use to, they had to
obey Moscow's orders. And in real life they were not allowed to kill Jews, but if they
caught the Jews they killed them. They killed a lot of Jews, the partisans, a lot.
And we were walking and walking and walking, my father with his ;
but when he found me | was full of lice. | was like one lice from toe to head. And in
the middle of the night, | remember like now, we went into somebody's house and |
started to cry, this is after he found me, he said, "| have to save my child." She
looked at me, she said, an older lady, she said, "Oh my God, my child, my child.
What is it? What's happening to you?" | was swollen here, | wore the same outfit,
you know, it was hard already from the blood. And full of lice, | had a big head of
hair. She took me in. She was a nice lady. An older lady. She had like a big, how
you call it? Made out of wood where you bathe someone, bathe the children or
bathe a pig, who knows? She put in some water there. My father had his, this
machine that you cut hair off. First of all, the first thing he did he cut off my whole
head of hair. The lice were gone. They put me in this , how you call
it? In the val-it (oh) we use to call it. And they gave me a bath, he said, "But | have
nothing for you to wear. | can't give you anything to wear." She said, "I'm going to
give you some of mine." So she gave me something to wear, something what she
was wearing. Everything, | mean, panties, those panties. And she
gave me a pair of lop-chess (ph), it's made out of straw to put on my feet. And she
said, "| have nothing else. It's cold. How could you walk on that?" So she went
into her stable and there was a big pig there. And the pig was covered with a big
blanket, it's like a burble, how you call it?

Q: Burlap?
A: Burlap. She took it off. She said, "This will keep you warm." And she gave this
to me, they gave me a bath, they cut off my hair. And she said, "But you have to
live." And she gave me something to eat, and she said, "But you have to leave my
house. You have to go. Go, go, | don't want to see you. You were never in my
house. Just take off because they are going to kill me. The Germans are going to
kill me." And we took off. That little old lady, I'll never forget too. And we walked
again, the two of us, and two more people. And we walked and we walked and we
walked, and my father who use to walk daytime, we use to hide at night. We
walked and stole a potato. We stole carrots, in the woods, | mean in the gardens.
And he used to give the peasants a haircut because in those years they didn't have
those automatic razors and how to take a haircut. So they had pity, kind of, for us,
some of the peasants, non-Jewish people. And we walked and we walked and we
walked until we came to this particular place, close to , It took us
months. And the name of it was Lublin. And he said, "Look, | have a profession."
They said, "Do you have ammunition?" He said, "No. | don't have nothing. | don't
have a pistol, | don't have a, | have nothing." He said, "But | have a profession. |
could give you haircuts. | could sew. I'll make you jackets". You know, whatever,
jackets from the ship things. He said, "But | have a child with me." He said, "No.
We'll take you ." They wanted to take him in, but not the child. He
says, "Well, I'm not going without the child. Either you take us both. I'm sure she
could be useful, she could work." They had kitchens. They had, we lived
underground, like they call it in Russian , underground. And
there were only left over soldiers from Russia that they took off. When the
Germans passed by they were going and there was no war there actually, the
Russians they were running, in the Russia and the Germans just took it over, that's
it. It wasn't any shooting there. And so they said, you know what, they said, "We
have a town that, the partisans own it. There's no there. We are
going to put you're daughter in one of those houses. They are going to keep her.
But we're not going to take her in." There was no children there. And they did.
They put me in this peasant's house. For some reason, | must have been there for
quite a few months, | don't remember nothing of this particular house and what |
did. | must have been, | cleaned probably. | go to the fields. | went, as my father
use to tell me later on, why | blocked this out | cannot understand. | just remember
| slept on top of an oven. And it was so hot. Like, the cooking was in the middle
and the oven was like bricks. And this heated off the whole house. | slept on it. It
was impossible. This pain and this burning in my flesh I'll never forget. And also
this house had cockroaches. Lots of them. Lots of cockroaches. This | remember.
But the rest of it, what | ate, how | ate, | really don't remember. But of course they
needed my father for haircuts. He use to sew something, fix something. So they

because who knows? Here | am okay with the peasants, a minute later they could
give me out. You know, a German could come in or, but was
owned by the partisans. This town was owned by the partisans. So | was kind of in
a safe way but my father wasn't sure. And there was no transportation. | didn't
know where he was, where he is, if he's going to come back to pick me up or if he's
going to leave me there. Because | saw on the Prepitch (ph) how running people
left their children to die. | saw it. And this was in my mind. Some of them were
wounded, some of them were not wounded. And they left them and the parents
took off. And this was in my mind all my life, even when | came here to this country,
that my father's going to leave me. Which he never did. He was the best father.
He saved my life. Not just this time, there was other incidences, and the partisans,
true, they wanted to kill me. And he said no. But this was in my mind because
what | saw on the Prepitch (ph). The parents left their children. And one day, all of
a sudden a buggy came with a horse and two soldiers and they came into the
house. But! stayed. And he brought me like a little, he made it, he put it together
for me, from wool, sheepskins. Like a little jacket. And he brought me a pair of, put
together from little boots, you know? And he put me on that wagon and he took me

would have raped me, they would have killed me, they would have never taken me
in. They didn't need me. But they needed my father. Sometimes | use to even go,
they taught me how to use a, not the piece of rifle gun, but the long ones. The...
Q: Rifle?
A: The rifles. They taught me how to use it in case something comes up. They
didn't want me, but there was other two Jewish girls there. One was older than |
am and one was younger. Also because of their brothers. They had brothers. And
this is all, there were three children, Jewish kids. There was no females at all, they
were not allowed to have any females there. It was a regular army, organized
army.
Q: And what was life like with the partisans? Like, how many people were there?
Did you travel? Was their fighting?
A: We traveled, they were fighting. They were not so many fighting, they were
bombing us. The Germans knew that the partisans are there but it was town and

towns and miles with partisan, soldiers, armies, that the Russians left there when
they took off and they ran. And the Germans, they were so busy with the Front and
with the fighting, it was a real organized group, thousands of partisans, thousands.
And they use to, my father knew more, unfortunately my father's dead. But they
use to put bombs, when the Germans use to send, let's say ammunition to the
Front, into deep Russia, the partisans knew about it. And they use to put bombs
under the trains and stop them and just explode them. They shouldn't be able to
take it to the Front, the ammunition and the soldiers. They killed thousands and
thousands of them, thousands of Germans. They never made it into deep Russia
because the partisans really, so they tried to bomb us out. They tried, they kept on
constantly bombing. And in one of these bombings we ran and | lost my father. |

And my father, he was only thirty-six years old so he still was a young man, but for
some reason, | was younger of course, and | lost him. | lost him and | couldn't find
him. And we passed by a river. We passed by a river, | was like in the front. The
partisans, what they did, in order for the other to cross the river, because it was
really burning and bombing heavily, they put like ropes. Some partisans swam
through and they put a rope and two ropes on this side and this is how you pass the
river. A few of them passed, it was, of course, | think it must have been a very, very
hard thing to do, and having partisans with ammunition. | got hold of this thing and |

were stealing some food, because the partisans, the group fell apart. The majority
group was left behind. | was with just about a dozen people, maybe two dozen
people. Nobody wanted to take care of me, to give me a piece of bread, nothing.
But these two particular people, they just felt sorry for me. Whatever they got they
shared with me. And one night we were laying there in the bushes, it was cold
already, it was close to winter. All of a sudden somebody stretching like that, | said,
Oy-vey, what am | going to do now? It's going to, and he's sort of laying completely
like, freezing. They took off their jackets, he covered me. He covered me with
whatever he had, his jacket. There's some good people in this world, there really
are good people. And then | walked with them, | held on to them and they were
watching me. Until the other group of the partisans, the bombing stopped and we
got reunited. But my father couldn't find me, he really couldn't find me. Do you
want to hear the story, how he found me again? And we walked and we walked
and there was a, you walk daytime, nighttime and you stay hidden, and these two
people shared with me they're piece of bread. There was not really a partisan here.
The real partisans were left behind. And we came to a town and | was with them
and there was a doctor, not a doctor, it was a felcher (ph), a doctor. And people
started to get sick on typhus, stomach typhus. | was the only girl. | wouldn't say a
woman, | wasn't a woman, the only girl. And this doctor said to me, he said, "You
know what? I'm going to show you how to take care a little bit of sick people."
People started to get sick on the typhus, they were just dying under you're hands,
under you're feet. He said, "This town is from partisans, it's a partisan town. Let's
see what." And some other partisans came and | was with this doctor and he was
telling me how to put a bandage on, how to give him, there was no medications,
there's some tea. And we weren't, and the bombing started again. This was
already a few weeks later. And the bombing started again. And a bomb, | was with
the typhus people, | got sick on typhus. | got sick on typhus and the temperature
was running high and then when the, and they were laying on bridges kind of,

women, in the towns that, you know, look at me? There's no woman, there was
nothing. There was a skin and bone little girl. And they were not allowed. So |
slept like against the wall most of the time but with the rest of the people, they were
sick on typhus. And | got it, | got it. And | started to, | remember once they even
brought, they flew down from Moscow, packages of medications. They had

did you get here? When they were walking from the other side of the river and then
they crossed the river and then they came, the bombing stopped, and then when
the bombing started again and the town was burning, he kept on yelling, "| had a
daughter someplace, | had a daughter someplace. Maybe you saw a little girl?"
And they kept on telling him, maybe she's here, maybe she's there, maybe it's in
this house. And until he came where | was laying under this building. But | couldn't

was just before the liberation | guess, this must have been like six months before
the liberation. And we had bombing and bombing and the partisans more or less
had started to fall apart. But we belonged to the group yet, and they wanted to kill
me, the partisans. He was schlepping me on his back and he said, "Well, if you
drop her and any Germans get her, she might talk a little bit. Maybe she knows
anything, | mean, she knows something." And they just wanted to kill me. And |
heard that, | wasn't unconscious. Maybe sometimes. And he said, "No, you will not
kill my daughter. If you want to kill her, first you have to kill me so | wouldn't know
it. Then you could kill my daughter." And they didn't. And he schlepped me, he
schlepped me on his back. | was walking with a big, not a cane, but a big stick of
wood, and after the liberation yet | was walking with that stick. | couldn't walk. And
this is how he saved my life. We were liberated not far from So-you-sk (ph). When
we got there, there was no government at all yet. They didn't have any government
yet. But there were no Jews yet. There was, for about three or four days, there
was no government at all. It was like, the Germans took off and the Russians came
in and there was no government yet. And finally | guess the government got
organized, the Russians, and they. | remember walking with this stick, with my
father's help of course, and there was telephone poles and on every pole there was
hanging a German with his head down. On every pole. | don't Know if | should tell
this or not. On every pole. The partisans cut some Germans or some peasants
that were involved, who was a policeman and he killed Jews or he was a policeman
and killed partisans, who was a guy who was with the Germans, you know? They
caught him and they hung him up. They were hanging. | remember when we
came to Sloo-sk (ph) that was the first day | think, but we just walked in there and
they had caught some Germans, the partisans | guess, Germans, Poles, the others
who were involved in the German government, and they threw them all, certain
things | remember well, certain things | don't, | just don't remember, but this |
remember. They put them like in one, big mountain of people, living people, alive.
They were crawling on each other like worms. Some wounded, some healthy. And
the partisans said to my father, they said to him, "You know what? You have this
rifle. Why don't you hit them? Hit them in there. Give them for you're wife, for
you're son. Give it to them." My father gave one hit and he passed out. He can't
do it. So they said, "Come on, how about you? You're a young girl." | must have

my stomach, | started to throw up. | couldn't hit one German. | just couldn't. And

house. | got out, | just sneaked out. And | asked for some food. On the way back

out of me. They threw me back into the ghetto, they could have killed me on the
spot. They threw me back into the ghetto with a swollen face, beat up. Not the
Germans beat me up, the Poles. And here | couldn't hit one German. | couldn't.
My father couldn't, he gave one hit and he passed out. There is Jewish people for
you.
Q: Let's talk a little bit about how you got to the DP camps and what they were like?
A: Well we were liberated in Swoot-ska (ph) and my father was always a Yiddishist
and he said, "Well let's go to my home town." He met a woman in Slot-skol-sa (ph)
and we knew that my mother's dead, and we went to my hometown and then he
went to a bigger town in Pinske (ph) to look for some more Jews. Pinske (ph), in
Pinske (ph) a few people survived, not too many people. And another town by the
name of Wo-nin-yetz (ph) and they were talking, there was the hagga-nah (ph) and
there was the Brig-ha (ph) sneaking and looking and trying to organize Jewish
survivors. My father, | really don't know how he found out about it, he found out
about it and he got in touch with some people and he said, "You know what? There
is a way, they are going to take us to Israel from here. There is the Bra-han (ph),
the Haga-nan (ph), other Israeli organizations. And they are going to somehow get
us out of here and we're going to go to Israel. My father had two sisters and a
brother in America. But he didn't remember the address, he didn't remember
nothing. | mean, he lost everything that was left in the house before we went into
ghetto. And there was no way of getting in touch. But with the Hagga-na (ph),
Abra-ha (ph), | really don't know which one it was, they organized the left over Jews
who ever survived. And they were going to send us, we had to go | think to
Bialystok, to some organizer. This was the main place where they tried to get some
Jewish names and Jewish people and he went there and he registered kind of
there and then he came back, this | remember, and then we went, they smuggled
us, it was 1945 yet. We were liberated in 1944, in Sou-Iska (ph), a year before the
regular liberation. And they smuggled us as Greek Jews to Lodz. We came to
Lodz, very well organized, they put us in a Kibbutz (ph) being we were partisans

and soldiers. They put us in a camp by the name of Ba-hack (ph). It was not a
camp really, it was more like a group. And we came there and were registered
there, they brought us there. | think they gave us papers...
End of Tape 1.
Tape 2
Q: This is interview with Florence Eisen, tape 2. Okay, we were just talking about
after liberation.
A: Yeah. And from there they smuggled us in, we're not allowed to speak any other
language but Hebrew, | guess. | was the only one who knew a little Hebrew, how to
speak Hebrew. But by then already my father remarried. He got married in Swiss
government, a Jewish woman with a child. More or less my age, so we were the
four of us.
Q: Who was she? How did he meet her and where?
A: He met her in Swoo-sk (ph), he met her in Swoo-sk (ph) right after the liberation.
Some Jews started to come in from every part of Russia. They came from, she
was born and raised in Swoo-sk (ph) but in the war her husband got killed right
away, | guess, they killed him. And they kind of, | don't know how they got to deep
Russia. But after the war, it was not after the war the war was still going on for a
whole year, but in that area, in Swoo-sk (ph) the war was over. So she came with
her daughter, also a son but the son was in the army, and my father was a young
man, thirty-six years old, a lonely person with a child, and he met her. She just
came from, | think she was around Moscow someplace, and he met her. And she
was also a young woman, lonely. And they got married there. She knew that my
mother's dead, | mean, they knew my mother is dead. And he married her. So we
were like four of us. She wasn't a good stepmother. She was a mean stepmother
to me, like in the books. | had another war with her. This woman really didn't give
me to eat, that's how mean she was to me. Let her rest in peace now. And she,
we traveled from Lodz through Czechoslovakia, through Germany, into a displaced
camp not far from Munich by the name of Poke-ing (ph). They brought us there,
they gave us clothes, they sanitized us, they cleaned us up. We were clean
already more or less, more or less we were clean. And they start to give us, it was
an organized camp for misplaced people. They gave us packages of food. And
they started to leave, more or less, they gave us a room. It was like a barracks and
like little rooms, so they gave us a small room. They gave us enough food. And, of
course, my father always had a profession, he was a barber. So he started right
away to work in the camp as a barber. We were free already, of course, and we

were there. We came in 1946 in January and we left and they closed this
misplaced, the DP camp, they became like in 1948. | got married there, met my
husband there, got married there, had a nice wedding. But then when Po-king (ph)
got closed, they send us to another camp by the name of Feldafing where my son
was born, my son was born there in Feldafing.
Q: How many people were in the camp? Were there many other children?
A: It was a big camp, yeah. Whoever had survived. | mean, they get at us, they
took us to a place in Mechelen and Saltzheim (ph) and they at us, |
guess they sent other people to different camps too, but this was all organized from
Israel. Hagga-nah (ph), Abra-ha (ph), I'm not sure which group did it, but that was
well, also from Hi-yas (ph) already, we were supported from the Hi-yas (ph) from
the United States. They found us, my father's two sisters. Unfortunately the
brother just died when we came, but the two sisters they found out for us. It was,
the food and everything, the clothing and food was mainly through the Had-dasa
(ph), Hi-yas (ph), excuse me, not Had-dasa (ph), Hi-yas (ph).
Q: And what did people do during the day? What did people occupy themselves
with?
A: What did people do? We start to get organized, like | knew like a little Hebrew.
There was kitchens. That there were cooks and brought in food and whoever didn't
have any food to eat, you came there, you ate in the kitchen, in the
kitchen. Or like we had like a family, my stepmother and my father, they gave us
care packages and my stepmother cooked for us. My father is being a barber. He
started to work right away as a barber. There were organized, they start to
organize like schools for children. | was like a kindergarten so | was teaching, | was
talking, | had to talk Hebrew to the kids and | knew some Hebrew so | spoke
Hebrew to the children. | have pictures, | have a picture from it. And | guess
whoever was a tailor and whoever was a shoemaker, everybody started to
reorganize their lives a little bit, in that camp even. We had, next door to us, we
had a Club with music and the young kids use to go dancing there, next door. We
were liberated, we were free. We were already free. And this was, and we start to
correspond with my father's two sisters. They send me packages, clothing, food,
money. We had enough food. And we were there from about 1946 of January. In
March my husband came with his group and we met and we were courting for over
three years. And in 1948 we got married.
Q: How did you meet you're husband?
A: You know, the Jews somehow they are, they know how to live and they are
survivors. So as soon as we got there it was a group like actors and | wanted to be

an actress. So |! went over there and | said, well | could dance, | could sing, take
me in, this kind of stuff. And they put up a show, there was like 7,000 Jews maybe
in that camp. A show, , an old, old Jewish show. And
they gave me a part in the other, interviewed me, this guy and they gave me a part
in there. So they put up like a and after the show, there
was dancing. So | was in the show. | played my part and after the show | washed
my face, whatever the make-up was on, and | went down and was dancing. And
this young man came over to me and asked me to dance. | said okay. And once
or twice, we were both very good dancers, and this is how we met. And we never
left each other again. It was just instant love, instant love. And that's how we met
and we were going steady, and then when they closed the camp, | got married
there. We went to, they sent us to a camp, | was pregnant. They send us to a
camp by the name of Fohrenwald. | was there, | gave birth there. Meantime, the
family of my father, the two sisters, especially one sister, was working we should
come to America. She just wanted us in America, it's a good country and she
wanted everybody. She wanted her brother, his wife and stepsister, me, my
husband. But my father didn't tell them that | got married. So they send us, at that
it was affidavits, it was not contracts yet, it was affidavits. They made up papers
and they were going to take us from Po-king (ph) to America. But meantime | got
married and | put another name on the contract, on the, later on it was contracts,
affidavits, whatever. And then, all of a sudden, | got pregnant. And they had to put
somebody else on it, on the, so anyway, when we moved to Fohrenwald they, my
stepsister, she says she doesn't want to go to America. She doesn't want to go to
America. She got up and she went to Israel. She went to Israel and my father's
sister started, | shouldn't go to Israel. | should come to America. They didn't have
any children. They wanted me as a child, they will do for me, they'll give me, they'll
give my husband a good job. He had no profession, he was 21 years old when he
married me, he had no profession. We had no skills. | was already with a baby.
We took some lessons in camp, in English, how much do we know English? Yes or
no, maybe thank you, that's about the whole thing. But my stepmother, being her
daughter, at that time it wasn't legal to go yet, being that the daughter's already in
Israel, she wants to go to Israel too. So she schlepped my father to Israel. This
was in 1948, must have been the end of 1948 because | got married the end of
August, and a month later they left to Israel. So he saw what was going on there,
bad. Mo-mish (ph) people were starving and the wars and he kept on writing
letters, please my kin (ph) don't come here. | Know you don't want to be without
me, all those years, but now it’s a different world, it’s a free world. You're going to
see, | never wanted to leave my father for one day. It's in the partisans,
there were a few children and when the plane came, they wanted to take them to
Moscow. | said, I'm not going. Either I'll live with my father or I'm going to die with
my father. They left, they went to Moscow by plane, they took them. | didn't want

to go. | said, no way am | going without my father. Whatever it will be it will happen
to the two of us. I'm not leaving my father. So he said to me, "It's not the partisans,
it's not the war. The war is over. Go to my sister's. You'll have a good life. You'll
come here with a husband who has no skills, who does not know a word of English.
Believe me, we are starving. There's no apartments. You can't get an apartment.
He doesn't have a profession. | have a profession. | could work as a barber, but
you're husband doesn't have a profession. He has nothing." Anyway, | let him, he
said, "If you're coming over I'm going to commit suicide. And then you're not going
to have a father all together. Go to America." And that's what happened. They
send, but then already the contracts came in. They send the affidavits and they
made affidavits for me, for my husband and for my son. Then they had to re-do it
because by the time the affidavits came my son was born and they had to change
everything around again, you know? And | said, well, let's go to America. My
husband had a family there, they didn't want him to go to America either. Because
they were going to go to Israel. My mother-in-law had two sisters in Israel. So we
were kind of written aside, | won the case. And we went to America. It just turned
out that | took my husband's whole family to America. A year later his brother came
with his wife and a daughter. And a year later, two-and-a-half years later, we took
over his mother, she still stayed in Fohrenwald and his married sister with her two
children and a husband. So | won the case. | took them all to America. Think that
I'm no sorry, it's a beautiful country, we've had a good life here. My husband works
hard. And then my father, after quite a few years, her daughter went to Montreal.
She got married in Israel and her daughter went to Montreal and | couldn't being
him here yet. So she took him to Montreal. Unfortunately he died when he was too
young, he died of cancer, he was fifty-six years old. But the time came that | could
have enjoyed my father and be with him and give him a little na-has (ph), he died.
Q: Before we talk about life in America, just again, the camps. How much was it,
like, did it feel at all like a sort of like a real life? You said there were classes, there
were schools, there were dances, there were plays. How was it like a, how do you
kind of build back a life’?

A: To me | knew it's not a real life yet, but it was good. It was heaven. | had
enough food. | had friends. Now | remember my friends, and the rest of the friends
| just block out, | remember nothing. But in camp, in Po-king (ph) it was a good life
for us. It was, but we weren't, if we had from 1939 until 1946 already it was, it was
already after the war, it was heaven. They gave us the hi-yas (ph) and there's
enough packages, enough food. It was kitchens, whoever couldn't cook for
themselves they took care of us, they give us clothing. It was a life. What we had
in the war, this was a good life. Some people from, survivors, they went to towns,
they went to business even there, they got married there. | mean, like in Minute-
hen (ph), Deblin, and those big cities, some of them got re-established there too but

my father was a, had a job and this was his profession and we went to this camp
and we had it pretty good. But we knew that sooner or later we would have to go.
This is not a place to finish, to make a life, the rest of our lives. It was, mainly it was
Israel. Mainly our aim was to go to Israel. But being of his two sisters and alarming
and coming and being, he was there before me and life was tough and life was
hard and life was really hard, you know? So we said good-bye and life in camp
wasn't a camp. Everybody had enough food to eat.
Q: What did people talk about in the camps?
A: It depends. We came out like from cages. That's all we wanted to do, is have a
good time. We went to work, we came back from work. | was working as a, first |
was working as a Hebrew teacher, no, first | was working in a place where they use
to make, it’s a factory you call it. They use to make little sweaters and gloves for
American, this was done through the Hi-yas (ph). So | knitted, being | knew how to
knit, | Knitted the little scarves, sweaters, little boots, gloves, and this was sent to
America. Where it was, | think to Texas someplace, | don't know. So, for this we
worked and every week we got a care package for that. No money. Just a care
package of food we got.
Q: So we were just talking about working and the daily life in the camp?
A: Yes, and the daily life, we as children, we had some friends. Once or twice a
week we went dancing. We belonged to this kibbutz (ph), Ba-hach (ph), which it
was for leftover partisans and soldiers. As a matter of fact, they send us, being |
knew a little Hebrew, they send a group of us to a different camp, Ba-drack-en-hive
(ph) to organize. It was also a DP, there for misplaced people. They send us to re-
organize Ba-hach (ph), to open up a new kibbutz (ph) and that's what we did. As a
matter of fact with some of the people | am still friendly up until now. Lovely people,
intelligent people. We were there for almost a year. And then that group, they
send him to Israel and | didn't want to go and they wounded up in the Cypress, and
| went back home to my father, in Po-king (ph). It was, fora DP camp it was a
pretty good life what we went through. Food, we had. Clothing, we had. We went
dancing. The Ha-yass (ph) took care of us. | had family in America, they send me
packages. But our aim was to go to Israel. This was our aim, is to go to Israel. But
being for my father's two sisters, they were yelling and screaming, we should come
here.
Q: And you were saying before that in the camps, people mostly talked about?
A: They talked about the past. They were still looking if anybody survived. They
were still looking if anybody, someplace survived. So they use to go to different
misplaced camps and look around there. They were looking, they were looking for

family. There was one from here, one from ten people, one from seven people,
mostly from concentration camps. Most of them. With the numbers. And what
could they talk? What we went through, and now what are we going to do now with
our future? What we going to do now? And broken up families. If there was a
family. My father made a family because he married that woman and she had a
child, and me, we were like a family. But most it was like one person, one person,
one person. Brother and sister? Not too many. Unless people who came from
Russia, who had a few families where they came from deep Russia and they were
like a few families together. But most of them, they were lonely, lonely people who
tried to find a mate and get married and have a, to be with somebody, not to be
lonely. Even some men who didn't know if the wife survived and they got married
and then the wife came, from someplace, who knows where? There was trouble in
this area. But we were two young kids with my father, my stepmother and we had
like a little home, you know? In one room. And then we went dancing, we were
laughing, we were playing cards, it was a pretty normal life in this DP camp, yes.
Q: Did people have much information about what had happened to their families or
their neighbors or their towns?
A: They did and they didn't. It still was unbelievable that something like this could
have happened. | went home, | knew what happened to my mother and my sister
and my brother. | knew it because the peasants told us. They were watching. And
from this side of the ghetto nobody survived, nobody. From the other side where it
was the uprising, like me, survives. And some other people survived. 500 people
run out of that area. But survive? Maybe 125. Some of them got starved from
hunger, some of them got killed, some of them got killed in the partisans. Some of
them got lost. Some of them remained in Russia. But the majority of people of my
hometown went to Israel. The majority.
Q: So let's talk about coming to America.
A: So this was my life in Germany. Got married there and then right away | got
pregnant and | had a little boy, which was like a miracle happened. | just, a miracle.
| couldn't believe it. As a matter of fact, when | got pregnant | was only 20. | was
20 when | got married. And | went to this doctor, the German doctor, and he said to
me, "You are pregnant." | said, "Well, yeah I'm married and now I'm pregnant."
And he said, "You shouldn't have gotten pregnant, you're not even developed yet.
You're not a woman, you're a child." | didn't even have, excuse me, my period

child. | don't Know what's going to happen to you but you shouldn't have gotten
pregnant." | had a tough time, | really had a tough time. In this country | would
have had a cesarean, but then they schlepped them out, they ripped me apart,

such a vitamins and such, good food. Even in the DP camp, like we had the cans
of Spam, cans of, it wasn't the right food for a child to eat and the right vitamin food,
you know? But then, of course, we got the papers and we immigrated to America,
the three of us. Me and my husband and my son. As a matter of fact, my Uncle,
they paid up that we shouldn't go by boat so he paid up to fly in here. We should fly
to America. When we got here the Ha-yass (ph) gave us back the money. And we
stayed, we came the three of us, without language, without real clothing, without
knowledge of anything. | mean, just young. Very young. My husband was 21 and
| was 20-something, not even 21 when | gave birth to him. And we stayed with my
Uncle and my Aunt, they were pretty good to us. It was my father's sister.

years. Many years.
Q: What did you and you're husband do when you first got here? Work? Did you
find an apartment?
A: Well we got here. My family picked us up. We stayed with them. It was very
hard in 1949, it was very hard to get an apartment. It was impossible to get an
apartment. So we lived with my Uncle and Aunt, they took us in. They had a
private house on Franklin Avenue. We live with them. They gave us food. They

gave us a little spending money. And then we knew there was a ha-yass (ph). My
husband use to go, | had a baby already, and he start to go to school, learn the
language, went to ha-yass (ph), got some information. They tried to give him a job
but he had no skills. So he was, | had a cousin who was a painter, he painted
apartments. He gave him a job as a painter. But before that he was a carpenter.
He didn't know how to keep a hammer in his hand, he was a carpenter. Then they
put him, he got a job, it was Moisher's (ph) Supermarket. He got a job there in
Moisher's (ph) Supermarket, he use to put the cans on the shelves. And then my
cousin took him in as a, to teach him how to paint, paint apartments. He was very
good at that, once he learned how to paint, and he learned and he painted and he
made some money. We stayed with my family for six months, with my Aunt and
Uncle. And then they got us an apartment, also not far from Franklin Avenue, |
remember the address, 638 Catona Park South, East Bronx. They got us an
apartment. My family paid $600.00 under the table to get me this apartment. But
they were very nice, they were not poor people, and they got us this apartment,
came with some furniture. And my Uncle bought me a brand new bedroom set, I'll
never forget, if | would have that set now it's an antique. | could have made a lot of
money. So |, beautiful two-bedroom apartment, it was on the second floor, two
bedrooms. But the rent was expensive, $42.50 a month. So what did | do? A lot of
came in there and there's one single guy who | knew him from Po-king
(ph). | rented to him as a boarder. So he lived, | rented the apartment to him and
he gave me like, $25.00 or $30.00 a month, so that was a big help with paying rent.
And then a year later, to me it was heaven on earth. If | could go to

bought bread and milk and | baked cakes and | went out with my kid to the park

you get use to it. And then a year later, we brought his brother and his wife and a
child here. And he worked, being my husband worked a little bit by Moisher's (ph)
Supermarket and my brother-in-law who worked in Germany, he was in a different
camp in Germany, also with this kind of a supermarket goods, and they were
thinking of going into business. No profession, what do you do? You go into
business. So they start, they looked into it and they bought like a small, little
grocery. Money we didn't have. And my Uncle said to me, "Humph, | gave you
everything. I'll give you a business? What does you're husband know about

business? Was he ever .. .[End of side 1 of Tape 2]. . . but to give us money? To
go into business. He said, "You're not, you're still green horns. You have to bring
yourself up first before you go into business." Anyway, we borrowed here a few
dollars, there a few dollars, and he worked. Those years he made nice money as a
painter. And we saved up. He didn't even know, | saved up $1,500.00. And then
when he went to business, where are we going to get the money? | took out the
$1,500.00, | said, "Here's $1,500.00." He said, "What? Where did you get the
money?" | saved it up. And his brother brought a set of Rosenthal (ph) dishes from
Germany, he sold that. And they bought like a small, little grocery. And they
cheated us from top to bottom, from top to bottom. We couldn't make a living out of
it. Not two families. | remember they started to take out, like $30.00 a week, and
some food when they could. By then already | had a beautiful apartment, they had
an apartment. The ha-yass (ph) helped with apartments, a lot of people, a lot. |
was lucky that | had my Uncle, my Aunt, my father's sisters helped us. But the
other newcomers, they use to call those years, the ha-yass (ph) helped.
Help with money, paid for rent, gave money for food, for a while. Until you got jobs.
They tried to give you jobs, they got you jobs. And luckily, as | said before, my
family was very helpful. They gave me kosher dishes, they gave me ;
they gave milk, they gave , | was kosher in those years, very kosher. And
this is how we bought this little store and they cheated us. They were
green, they were green. But they never gave up. They didn't give up, and then
there was, they started to build a huge, big building on the concourse. The store
was like off the concourse and they started to build like a big building with a huge
supermarket on the bottom. Well, they got panicky. If this huge supermarket goes
in, we are completely out. At least, legally we push through days and months
thinking what to do for the future, but now with this supermarket coming up, forget
it. So they looked at each other, the two brothers, and they said to themselves,
how do we get this supermarket? We could buy it. But we don't have any money.
What are we going to do for money? There's no money. My Uncle says he's not
giving me any money because you're going to lose it, he said, they cheated you out
of this little store and now their going to cheat you again. He wouldn't give it to us.
Here | have already another child was born, my daughter was born in 1952. What
are we going to do? We started to talk to Green-na (ph) and Green-na (ph) are
really helpful, you know? And they lended us money, they got $2,000.00 here,
$1,000.00 there. Maybe we got something for this little store here, | don't know how
much. My husband maybe knows more about it. And believe it or not, we bought
this Supermarket. They went to the people that put in the electric supply and they
went to the people that gave us the food, you know? Am | correct, Heshew?

A: How we got into the supermarket, to the big supermarket? It was the first air
conditioned supermarket in the Bronx. | think in New York, maybe.
Heshew: Yeah.
A: The first air conditioned supermarket. We have pictures. There was a line when
we opened up, there was a line around the corner coming into the store to buy.
And we worked hard, | mean, they worked hard. They worked very, very hard.
They still took out very little money, and to pay up all the debts, that we owe people
money. And the business, | was in seventh heaven. | have enough food. | could
give my kids food, food, food, food. Until now, my gut obsession is food. Just to
have enough food for my children and for my grandchildren. They are always right
about me. Why is my Babba so obsessed with food? So | explained it to them,
how many years | was hungry. That! had raw beets and raw potatoes, and now |
have food and | don't want my kids to get hungry. We're not going to be hungry,
don't push on us. And thank God the store was good. And we saved and we
saved. We lived very, how you say it? Within splash, with lots of money. And

they had and they worked very hard. In those years the supermarkets
were open seven days a week. And later hours. He hardly saw the children. By
the time he came home the kids were already in bed, like 7 or 8 o'clock. Until 7
o'clock the store was open, Friday until 9 o'clock, | think it was. And Saturday,
Sunday, it was seven days a week. And then they opened up another store. On
Kingsley Avenue, another supermarket. In the beginning it wasn't
good, in the beginning it was really, it was bad. But then with hard work and a little
by little it was good. It was good. He made money, we made money and | had my
home, which | didn't have a house but apartments, which | was always in seventh
heaven. | kissed the ground in this country. | had my family, | had my food, | had
my FrigidAir, | had my home. What?

slaving and she was kissing the ground. Not a bad idea.

A: Well here we started like accumulating together. Like all the survivors. One
family was looking for another one. We got together. We had our own groups. |
really didn't, | only mingled with my family, which | had family, cousins, they were
very nice to me, very nice. | had a big, beautiful family and they took me in with
open arms. But concerning the , that we were called all those years, the
newcomers, the survivors, we got together. We had our groups. We start to play
cards, we let a normal life. Tried to lead a normal life. Of course, the past, you
cannot forget. And you cannot just let go. It's deep in you're mind and in you're
heart. | think of it until the day you die. It will never, never, never leave us for one
minute. Those years back, even up until now we have the same organized
organizations, which is only by survivors. We have New Years Eve parties. | got
involved, years later, | got involved in the ZOA. We had a group, then we moved
to, this was many years later, to Pelham Parkway. | got involved there. | was
President of the , It's a Chapter from the ZOA. District 20. And we
made like a Ladies Auxiliary, it's a chapter of it and | was President for ten years. |
worked very hard, of course no pay. And we raised money for Israel. Our lives
was quite normal. | still did not talk about what | went through to the kids. Until my
grandchildren started to grow up and understand what means, they start to learn in
school and ask questions, then | started to talk about it. But our life here was pretty
good, | can't complain really. | never complained and my husband worked very
hard. | never worked. To me the kids were my first priority. And | took care of the
kids, | didn't trust any babysitters. For five years | never saw a movie in this
country. Any place | went there were the kids and the kids and the kids. Later on,
when they got a little older, | put my emphasis on education. | tried my best to push
my kids through schools. If they were weak, to, never had a babysitter in their lives.
To, how you call it, someone to help my kids with education because | wasn't
knowledgeable enough in this country to learn English. | never went to school here.
Whatever | learned, whatever | know in writing or reading, is only from reading. |
read a lot in those years, an awful lot. And this is what | tried to push on my kids.
Send them to Hebrew school, send them to, | led a pretty normal, Jewish life.
Going to even when they, when my husband went to
work | took both kids, schlepped them to school. Of course, the holidays, | was
very close with his family. He had a, then two or two-and-a-half years later, after
we came to this country, | think two-and-a-half or three-and-a-half years, we
brought his mother, his sister with her family, a husband and two kids, to this
country. And | considered myself extremely blessed and very lucky to be into a
family. Because | didn't have anybody from my mother's side or my, | had my
father's two sisters and some cousins here, but they were very good, but survivors?
| was the only one. There was another sister of my mother with five kids. They all

go into a full family. They all came from Russia. My husband lost his father right
when the Germans came into their town, they killed him immediately. No, they
didn't. They took him into a camp and they burned him, to Belzec. And he got
burned, they burned him. But the two brothers and the sister and the mother are
very, very close. All these years, they were in business together, we lived in the
same area together, more or less. | lived in , the Parkway, they lived
on the Concourse and then they moved to Parkway, and then we all
moved to Pelham Parkway. And that's where we lived for eight years until | moved
in here and | considered myself very lucky to be in a family like this and my life here
was quite normal. My husband tried to be in business all their lives, on his life. He
worked himself up. Thank God he made a good living, always. Money was no
problem. When | had the supermarkets, food, | always had galore. And we went
into real estate little by little. And thank God financially we did pretty well for
ourselves.
Q: What sort of things became important to you based on you're experiences
during the war? You said food, for one.
A: My family. My children. To raise my children, maybe in a liberal way, maybe too
much liberal. Maybe too much of liberal. To raise my kids, to give it to them, they
shouldn't be hateful. They should love all kinds of people. They should be good
people. They should have professions. They should have a profession and God
forbid a war comes over or whatever, they should have something to fall on.
Because my father, if not this profession where he was a barber, we would never
have survived. See, | wanted my kids to have some kind of a profession. Of
course, | didn't want them to be a tailor or a carpenter because this is not the
Jewish mother's thing for children. What does a Jewish mother want, is her
husband? Her children should be a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, at least a teacher.
So | was pushing for teaching for my kids. So both of my kids actually, originally
they became teachers. My son was a special education teacher and my daughter,
she wanted to be a veterinarian when she was a little girl, but she was raised in the
1960's. She was not really a full fledged hippie, but kind of on the very liberal side.
She went to Binghamton, to school, was . And what | said, |
was pushing for teaching. Now she became an Anthropology teacher, she's a very
bright girl. And she was teaching anthropology for a full year and then she came
home and said, "Ma, | don't like this profession. | don't want to be an
anthropologist." | said, "What do you want to be?" "I want to be a doctor." | said,
"You're crazy. Now, after so many years, so much work you put in being a teacher,
now you want to be a..." "I want to be a veterinarian." Well, she's very bright. |
was against it. The truth is she took crash courses in Italian. She was short in Bio,
she was short in Chemistry, and she went to Italy and she became a doctor
veterinarian. And she's practicing now. And she's doing very well. She has her

own place and she is a very good veterinarian. My son became a special
education teacher. And after a while he didn't like teaching either. He didn't want
to be a teacher. And he got hooked up with a friend and somebody else, | guess,
and they went into Nutra System Diet Centers. And thank God, God was good to
them. He did very well. Very well. He makes a good living. Now the Nutra
System is not so well, the Diet Centers, but he makes a living, thank God. He does
pretty good. She's also a teacher, his wife. A lovely, lovely Jewish girl, very nice.
An angel of a child. And they gave me three beautiful grandchildren. And this is
my whole life, | live for them. | lived for them. And | still do. | still do live for the
children. This is my whole life. Nothing else matters to me.
Q: And you were talking about discussing the stories from the war with you're kids.
| mean, did you discuss, did you talk about it with you're husband? Did you talk
about it with other people?
A: With my husband, we talked, yeah. | talked to my husband, also not too much.
Also not too much. He never talked at all. But also not too much. | was going on
with my daily routines of life. Getting up in the morning, cleaning, see that the kids
should go out for fresh air, taking them to schools, baking, being with his family,
being with my family. And this was more or less my life, was wrapped around this
here. Not too much talking. | started to really open up more when my
grandchildren started to ask questions because it was, when my kids went to
school they didn't talk too much about the Holocaust. They really didn't. Not in
schools. But at home, | couldn't talk. | didn't want to put this pain on them. But
only when my grandchildren in Junior High School, | think, started to talk about it.
And then they kept on asking questions and | really started to open up to them.
And | was sitting with them, they were writing and telling what | told them and | told
them what | went through. They do know. | don't Know if they know every, little
detail, but most of it. They do, they know what | went through, yes, they do know.
Q: How did you talk to your own kids? | mean, you're son was born in one of the
DP camps.
A: . He knew that | am a survivor and | went through Hitler and | lost
my mother, my sister, my brother. | survived. And that's how | met his father. He
knew that he was born in this DP camp in Fohrenwald, he knew about all those
things. Which is not, it's painful and as a child they cannot realize what this means
and how much pain his mother went through. And even, | don't know if they know
even the loss, if they could feel what | lost. If they could feel my loss and my
mother. | was raised without a mother practically. When | needed her the most she
wasn't there anymore. And | had to take care of other people all my life, in order to
survive. This was in the partisans, even after the war, when my father married my
stepmother. She wasn't a good woman and | had to prove myself, to be good and

to be, and to do things. | always took care of somebody, all my life I, nobody,
except | happen to take care of me, but | always did for people that my life should
be easier or to be good or to impress people. They shouldn't hurt me, they
shouldn't leave me. The fear of leaving was in me a lot, a lot. Like especially fear
with my father of leaving. It was really kind of a, painful to me. Very painful. Even
here, being in this country, and he didn't live here. This feeling went away when he
died. It's like it was wiped away, like | was relieved. And up until then, until the day
he died, just either | was holding on to him . When he died, | was sure
that, you know, God took him away and | cannot even explain. | cannot explain the
feeling of it. The fear that I'm going to be left alone. But when he died, its like
something, a clock in me says well, this is, if he left you and he will never come
back and you have to take care of yourself and you're family. This is you're family.
You're father is gone, you cannot lay on him anymore. You cannot depend on him
anymore. He cannot save you anymore. These fears for some reason, it was, it
was a terrible, frightening thing. Maybe if it was just me, maybe other people didn't
have this, | don't know. But | had this pain, | had this terrible pain.
Q: Before you're father died, what was you're relationship with him? After the war,
did you talk to him about that?
A: Unfortunately, yeah, we talked, | talked to my father, yeah. | was like his life. |
was, | am by nature, | was a strong, self-confident person. My father gave it to me.
He was the one who inflicted this on me. You are beautiful. You are the smartest.
You know how to do this and he gave me the confidence in him, in me. He made
me, whatever | am now, he made me. But unfortunately, circumstances after the
war ripped us apart. He went to Israel. | went to this country. Then he couldn't
come here. And he went to Canada. As soon as he got to Canada, he was, from
Israel he traveled to Argentina, he had a sister there. And from there he couldn't
come to straight here, but to Canada, through Italy, so he was in Italy. And | was
always of course in touch with him, close in touch with him. But really, being
together he should see me grow as a woman, grow as a mother, grow as a wife.
Having a family that, he never saw it because he wasn't with me. That's bothered
me a lot, it still does. , but when it came to
, for some reason it didn't work out. So then he lived in Canada,
in Montreal. And | use to go there constantly, he use to come to me. He was
when my son was born. It's not like you
could hold his for my child. It was just the circumstances didn't
happen, it just didn't happen. | use to go a lot to Montreal, | open him a
barbershop, | didn't have too much money then but | did my best. | opened him up
a barbershop to make him happy. They wanted to be there. And then,
unfortunately, he got sick. He got sick. He got sick and | use to schlep him here,
schlep him to doctors here. Schlep him for surgery here. He had eleven surgeries,

he had cancer in his testicles. And he was sick for about six or seven years. Now,
he would have been saved because medicine is so progressed now that prostate
cancer is now much easier to help and to cure within those years. | mean, he died
six months . Six months.

Q: Did you look back on the war together though? Did those things you talked
about, were they about the war?

A: Yeah, we talked to each other, yeah. With him | talked a lot, yeah. But he was
also one of those people who couldn't see me suffer. So he would start to talk, and
he said, take her around it, around it, don't talk. Don't aggravate yourself. You're
here. You have a good husband, you have a beautiful family. Don't go back. No.
Before he died, he called in me and my Uncle and my Aunt, and he said, "Look to
the High my kin", he said. "You went through a lot. This is you're first ,
I'm dying. I'm not going to make it, but | want you to have a the
way. The way, , the way you want it. That's you're first symbol in
you're life. Make a big bar mitzvah, make a nice bar mitzvah". He thought that |
was rich because | use to help him a lot and give him a lot. | had enough. Never
complained on money. And he said, "Don't worry. I'll be with you. I'm going to be
there every minute of you're step, watching you. , enjoy it." And
that's what | did. | made him a big bar mitzvah, | had to give him , Tl
have the music and | had because he didn't trust me. | had an
extremely close relationship with him, close. Because this is all | had, you know?
And | saw where other fathers left their children, he didn't. He was really watching
over me. He use to wake up in the middle of the night, touching to see if I'm there.
lf not, God forbid, some soldiers grabbed me someplace, to rape me or something.
He was so overprotecting me. He did. He protected me. There's no end to it. It's
just, it was a time period in my life, in this country, that | had good times. | raised
my kids. | was involved in the ZOA. | had the club, raised money. And |
was kind of a very, very happy person. Now, it comes with age. | think more than
ever. Why me? Why did | not take my sister? Why didn't | schlep my mother with
me? Maybe they would have survived. It's like conscious. I'm not blaming me, but
actually my mother saved my life. She pushed me out of the second ghetto. But
maybe my sister would have survived if | had grabbed her hand and take her to the
other ghetto. Why didn't | do that? It's, | have more time on my hands now and
many times you don't sleep at night, you think. And | cry a lot. | do cry. And if I'm
by myself, | say, why didn't | do this? Why didn't | do that? Maybe things would
have been different. But | guess I'm not the only one. | read a lot about it. | read
the book about the children, survivor's children. | think everybody feels this way.
I'm not the only one. | have a girlfriend, , she's going for therapy. |
mean, fifty years later. And she just started to go for therapy because she can't
cope with it, she can't live with it. After fifty years. This is one of the girls, she lives

in New Jersey, that we survived together. Her father actually saved my life up in
. He gave me this piece of fish and she is a very educated girl. She
came here single, she went to school, she was a teacher at Stiverson High School,
and she just, now, , she's not old, | mean, she just can't, why did
she do this and why didn't she do it and why her sister got killed, her mother got
killed? Three kids got killed. Maybe she is blaming herself a lot. It's kind of like
she went back to Lock-ma (ph). She went back to Lock-ma (ph). She's, her fear
just in this age, she lives with this fear. | lost the fear. | don't have this fear. Oh,
when | hear something happens to Israel, | get panicky. I'm, you know, | get
scared. But the fear of bombing and running, it's gone. This is gone. You know?
But we are, | think each and every one of the survivors, is, how could you say it?
Very, very unhappy people. With all the happiness, with all the money they made
for all those years, with the children and the grandchildren and the homes,
financially okay, | have this home, | have a home in Florida. But deep in you, there
is certain pain that is unbelievable. And each and every one of us, whoever | talk
to, it just, | think it will go to grave or take it with us. This kind of thing that we've
been through. It's not just sometimes a person is being killed. To blame yourself,
you blame your father, you blame your mother, you blame the world. It's just,
at least you're alive and none of us is going to die young, but our whole
life was kind of a, in pain. We lived in pain. With the money, with the homes.
There was like a cancer in you that ate you up. This is life. This is our, even the
times that we blacked out, we didn't want to think about it, we didn't want to talk
about it, this guilt. Guilt of dancing, guilt of drinking, guilt, we are guilty to have a
good time. Why me? Why not my sister? Why not my brother? She was eight
years old, that little girl. An old lady of 85, my grandma. Had to get undressed? In
front of so many people and shooting, blowing her brains? Why? Just because
she was born a Jewish woman? So, as | say, with all those richness that our
have now, survivors. With all the good times, and we do have good
times, we go, we dance, we sing, we have wonderful times. But there's something
that is eating you up inside. Eating you up inside, like a cancer. And it just, | think,
i's me, | think. The older | get the worse it gets. Overprotective of my
grandchildren. Or if my son is flying. My granddaughter is flying. My grandson is
flying, he's going by car, he's going to come. It's just, what | went through, my son,
my only son | guess, | have a son and a daughter. It was in the 1960's and he
wasn't a good student and | was afraid by 18 they'll take him to Vietnam. Well, this
was the last thing | would have done. | would have, but | went to, not to in order for
him, he shouldn't go.

Tape 3
A: | just couldn't see, God forbid, they will take him to Vietnam, to another war, he
could get killed. And | couldn't. | just, | went from doctor to doctor, trying to make
him sick. I tried to, he shouldn't go to the, not to the army, but | forgot
how you call it. | pushed him into a school in Louisiana. He was such a bad
student. | mean, later on he picked up and he really is a great guy, a very
successful businessman. And he, we pushed him into a school in Louisiana and he
was there and he was doing bad and | was afraid, if he's going to drop out, they are
going to grab him into the Army. He had to stay in school. | went, at that time he
developed some boils from nerves. He was never away from me too, he was like a
mother's little boy, you know? | was always protective, the Jewish mother. | went
to doctors, to skin doctors, this is like I'm saying it here, off the record. | almost took
him out for $10,000.00 in those years. | cried my eyes out. | told him my story, |
said, | cannot afford to lose him. | almost say yes, | almost paid somebody off for
$10,000.00. | was going to get him out. Because | couldn't afford, otherwise if |
wouldn't be able to do this | would grab him and take him to countries or off to
Canada or someplace. He would have never went into the Army, never, never.
And | was running from place to place to place, telling my story, why | cannot send
him to the Army. Why it's not fair. | lost so much, why should | lose another child
now, this is all | have. And, but luckily, | mean, luckily all of it was very fixed, I'm not
sure, but the numbers came out. | don't Know if you know this story, in the 1960's,
they drew lottery numbers. And his number was the first one to be out. Then | was
safe with him. Then | was safe with him. | never gave my kids swimming lessons.
Now my grandchildren have everything because they don't listen to me. They
swim, the big ones swim too, but | was protective. | was very, very, very protective.
Q: Do you think you created, | mean, is it, can you create something of an ordinary
life like everyone around you who didn't go through the experiences of the war? |
mean, what other things sort of color you're experiences, as you're creating you're
family?
A: You mean an effect on my children?
Q: The effect on the family that you built?
A: I'm sure it did. I'm sure. There's a lot of books now written, especially my
daughter | think. She's a rebel. She married one non-Jewish guy for no reason at
all. Then she divorced this one after ten years and she married another non-Jewish
guy. Though | have a good relationship with her, she loves us very much. She isa
very bright, very pretty child. But maybe she picked up here and there about what
Jewish people go through and she married these non-Jewish people. Maybe that's
a reason to it. And my son now almost always says, —

, they're sick in the head. All children. But | think you
are normal, you are okay. It didn't effect you. He said, but luckily you didn't talk
about it. Because | have a niece here who, she's not crazy, she's very bright. She
has her problems | think and she blames that her mother talked too much. She
heard that her mother talked about the, what she went through, that she wasn't
. | was not in a concentration camp or Dachau or Auschwitz. Her
mother was a Russian and she blames, she was married, she was divorced. She
is not stable. Very bright girl, very bright. She blames her parents of talking too
much about the Holocaust. That's why she's screwed up. She does. And there
are a lot of books written about this kind of a thing, the children of survivors. That
they do have problems. So, | don't know. | don't think, | don’t think so of my kids,
that they really have problems because of that. | really don't think so. My daughter,
maybe she's a little rebel, she married one non-Jewish guy on top of another non-
Jewish guy. Maybe this has anything to do with that. But | don't see my son or my
grandchildren, any effect of the war. Maybe they don't talk about it and tell me, but
| don't think so. | really don't because | didn't show. | didn't show, | didn't talk, |
didn't act. | was always vivacious, outgoing person. Always.
Q: Did the war change you're views on you're connection to Judaism and later to
Israel and even to religion and God?
A: Yes. Yes. | cannot be partial to non-Jewish people. | don't trust them. | don't
believe in them. | just, for Israel, | would give my life of course. | worked non-
profitable organizations only to raise money and to send to Israel. When it comes
to non-Jewish people, | don’t have any confidence in them. | don't trust them. |
don't. Because we lived next door to non-Jewish people. The same non-Jewish
people who robbed my house. Grabbed my brother's violin. Killed my brother.
And | saw what they did. How could | have confidence in them? How could | trust
them? They use to come into my father's barbershop, eat and drink, and into my
house where we lived. My father's best friend. And then when | came to them to
ask for a piece of bread, they throw me out of the house. On top of that, they were
the worse killers in the ghetto. The worse killers. How could | have confidence?
How could | trust them? None of them. None of them, unfortunately, | don't trust a
non-Jewish person in relation to Judaism. | don't. I'm a good Jew. I'm not
religious. I'm not saying religious Orthodox religious. Deep in me | have a
conviction, you know? I'm Jewish. Tradition. | love the Jewish tradition. And |
gave my kids a Jewish tradition. Not religious maybe, | should have and maybe
this wouldn't have happened with my daughter, | don't know. But I'm not a young,
Israel person. I'm not. | ama, | wouldn't say a liberal. | try to teach my kids liberal.
Liberalism. | tried. They, maybe not to hate each other. Because it's wrong. It's
so wrong. That one race should hate the other like that. It's so wrong. It doesn't
bring any, even now, when | see what's going on in Bosnia, | can't understand.

Why? Why can't everybody, you're Jewish, be Jewish. You're Moslem, be a
Moslem. Don't hit me, | wouldn't hit you. You do your own thing. I'm going to do
my own thing. | can't understand this. Why hate each other like that? For what
reason? | have a right to pray for my prayer, but as long as I'm not hurting you. |
don't care if next door to me lives a , but don't hit me, don't hurt me, |
shouldn't be afraid of you. Be my neighbor. Be a good person to come into my
house, we'll have a cup of coffee, we'll talk about business, about the children.
Why hate me only because I'm Jewish or you are black? God created us like that
so why hate each other like this? For what reason? | can't understand this. And |
taught, | was teaching my kids the same way. But still, | didn't trust them. Because
for all the 2,000 years we are being, we are the one, now we have in Bosnia, it's
, It's different religions, but those, way back, you didn't have those
things. They always, every religion hated the Jews. Every religion hated the Jews.
From 2,000 years ago. Why? If you believe in God, God made it this way. Jesus
is not the God, God made Jesus, yeah? Jesus made himself as a, Jesus was
Jewish too. So why hate each other? We work hard. We came to this country.
We were never on relief. Never on footsteps. | had neighbors, nice people. So my
husband went to work, he scrubbed herring. Came home, he was smelling of
herring. Never saw his children go to bed and get up in the morning. We worked
hard for my , for our money, very hard. Why can't other people do this?
Why hate the Jews, because they are hard working people? The truth is, | have the
highest respect for the Oriental people. | love them. They are good people. They
don't bother me. We have them in my building. They go, they work, they work
seven days a week just like my husband worked. The families are the back of the
room. They eat whatever is left over, whatever my husband had left over in the
supermarket, he brought it home, | made a meal out it. They do the same thing.
They are beautiful people. They have a right to live like anybody else. They work
for their money. They are family orientated people. And that's what | tried to instill
in my kids, this kind of a liberal way of life. But it doesn't work. It still doesn't work.
One bad thing about the Jews, and boom, everybody's on the Jews. Everybody's
on the Jews. A plane's going to explode, they are going to blame the Jews. That's
why | would love to change the world. They should be one race. If there's a lot of
races, to teach them how to get along together. How to live together. How to
compromise. But! guess, | don't know how. I'm not, I'm too old and maybe if | had
been born here maybe | would have some kind of knowledge. But I, so | guess |
am in a way a liberal. That! don't trust in non-Jewish people against the Jews, you
can't blame me for that. What | went through. What | saw with my own eyes.
Though, some Christians are very nice to me, very nice. They gave me food.
Gave me a haircut. Gave me shelter. So, but the majority in this world is against
the Jews. The majority of people are against the Jews. | can't straighten this out.

Q: You say that you're Jewish culturally, but maybe not religiously?
A: Yeah.
Q: Were you raised religiously?
A: Not really, my father was a liberal. He couldn't care less that he's a, we had a
kosher home. We had a grandma in the house, in those years, we had the kosher
home. My father went to Shula (ph) every Saturday, but not really Orthodox. |
never had non-kosher food in my house. My mother came from a more religious
home than my father. They came from two different backgrounds. My father came
from working people. As a matter of fact, my father's also a musician, was a
musician. There were ten children in his family. There were four boys and six girls.
And my grandpa was a musician. As a matter of fact, they took everything away
from me, | would have shown it to you. | have a picture and one of the books which
was crated by Bashevitz Singer (ph) and he has my grandfather there playing this
fiddle, that | gave the men. He was playing the fiddle, what | gave to this Museum
now. But they have everything. They still didn't send it back to me. | should really
be after them. So they were all four brothers, they were musicians, all of them. My
father played all the instruments, you just name it, piano, just natural, naturally
came to them. | don't think that, none of them knew how to play by notes, they all
played just from their heads. | was trying to bring something up, but | forgot what |
was going to say.
Q: Oh, we were just talking, | guess | was wondering whether you're experiences
during the war changed you're feelings on being a Jew in this country and other
places?
A: Well | was a child yet. | really didn't know much about any religious, religions of
the world. | had a kosher home, as | said. And my mother use to bake bread. It
was a small town and holly and we ate together, Friday night we ate
together. And . We were not like a young Israel, | wouldn't say
young Israel people. More tradition with a kosher home. Jewish traditionally
established people. But not , no. We were not . And | still am
the same way. Same way.
Q: Have you gone back to Poland or have you had any desires?
A: Yeah, | do have a desire. | do have a tremendous desire. | would like to be in
this grave. | was in this grave right after the war and | saw the big grave. Through
all those year, whoever survived in Israel, they really worked on it and they made
the , now there's no more Communism, but when it was the
Communism even, there was a nice group of Jewish, if | would have been in Israel,
| would have been over there many times, in Lackenbach. But in here,

her husband and one woman, what | was telling you, that she has some problems,
mental problems and she still, now she's going through group therapy, she's going
to a psychiatrist, like the whole thing came back to her, you know? It was like, she
can't live with it, it's just tormenting her. The past is tormenting her. And | don't
have anybody to go with. But from Israel they go constantly. They put up a
gorgeous monument, gorgeous. Even for the Russians, yet. A big monument with
all the parades and all the, whatever has to be done, and all the names. Whoever
is laying in this grave, my mother, my sister, my brother, my Aunts, my grandmas,
everything is written down. A big, big, beautiful monument. And many times, they
go like every year, when it was fiftieth, they are there since 1942. So they had like
a memorial there and everybody from Israel went. | had to go from America. |
have a back problem and | have this anxiety attacks, up until now, but in different
ways. And from this, | had nobody to go with. Last year | wanted to go, my
younger grandson wanted to go with me, and for some reason it didn't work out. |
have also a stomach problem, | have a terrible case of colitis. So 1 get nervous. |
sit on the bathroom more than I'm outside. And my husband says, well, you're
going to go by yourself. How are you going to travel? You have to either go to
Israel, go with them to Israel or you have to go to, meet them in Warsaw. He didn't
want to go, he's not a well person. He had two open-heart surgeries already. So
he said, | cannot go with you. And my family said, Babba, why are you going to
go? You have plenty of aggravation, you still talk about it, sleep with it, why? Don't
go. But I'm dying to go. | am dying to go. | want to go. But | don't Know how to
work it out. Maybe to go to Israel and go with them to Israel. From there to go. But
from Israel, they are going constantly. Every December there is a big, big, beautiful
monument. They take very well care of it. And maybe someday, if | leave, I'll go. |
will.
Q: You mentioned before that you find yourself thinking about those events more
and more?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you have any sense why? What that's happening? And did you not think
about it for a while as you were living your life?
A: | wasn't thinking for a while. There was quite a number of years in between that |
really didn't think. | was so involved with the ZOA and raising money for Israel,
buying bonds, selling bonds, getting dressed up, playing cards, raising my two
children, that | really didn't even think about it. | didn't think about it. | just kind of
like blacked out. Sometimes we got together, you know, a bunch of us, survivors,
and we talked about it and then when | left | had a normal life. Now it's kind of like
more and more on top of me. More and more reminders of it. | think more about it.

| am more in the house by myself, the kids are out of my life, thank God they're
doing well. | don't know, but | ask some people, survivors, as a matter of fact |
guess I'm not the only one. Because they opened up here on Pierce Blvd. group
therapy of survivors. Just survivors. A whole bunch of them. And hundreds of
people are going there. And | was thinking maybe | should go there too.
Q: And how does it come back? | mean, do you think about it at night, during the
day? Just certain images come back or what comes back into you're mind?
A: Images. What! went through. How | went out of this ghetto. It bothers me a lot
that my sister, at least my sister, my mother was only, | didn't realize how young
they were. My mother was thirty-six years old. | didn't realize that, I'm missing, like
I'm missing that side of the family. | think about what | went through in partisans
and my father died so young and he really didn't have enough time to have na-has
(ph) from me. And we talk now, we get together, our survivors, we talk about it. Do
| have maybe less to tell than the concentration camp people, then from Auschwitz,
Treblinka, My-don-ick (ph), you know they had it worse. They had it worse than
me, as bad as | had it they had it worse. And we talk about it, we do talk about it
and it bothers me more, it bothers me more my sister, that my brother didn't
survive. You think what you went through, you see on television certain things.
You see the misplaced people, it comes back to you. It comes back with and you
feel sorry for those people. But now they are being helped from people all over the
world. | say, why wasn't we helped? Maybe it would have been different by us if
people in the world would realize what's happening to us? Maybe we would have
had some help like those, | see the children, it really breaks you, you know?
Though they are not Jewish, but it doesn't matter. They are people. They don't
deserve this kind of a treatment. They are plain, different, ordinary people, why do
they have to get involved in this kind of a way of life’? And then you know, your own
life comes back, those years, and they say, well now at least they are lucky,
everybody's trying to help them and fight for them. Nobody fought for us. Nobody
heard about us. Some may think, well maybe they were happy to kill us out once
and for all, the Jews, and get rid of them. But they didn't, thank God. So, | don't
know. Every chance | have now | run to the kids, my grandson, my whole life, my
whole pleasure, | run to the kids. You think | make this punch here for myself? No.
For the kids. All for the children. And this is my life, the kids, now.
not going to die anymore, | would like to in the house from the kids
because they are good kids, thank God. Very protective over me, very protective
over me. Babba don't do this and Babba don't do that and very proud of me when
we go places, they introduce us. We went to my grandson's college graduation, |
didn't stop crying for one minute. | said, this happened to me. | lived to see a
grandchild graduating college? It's just unbelievable. It's just like I'm pinching, I'm
alive, I'm dead, | got killed in the partisans, | got killed in the ghetto. This is my

child? This is my grandson graduating from college? | lived to see it? Yes, | did.
Yes | did. It's just sometimes you wake up and you say, no, that's not me. That's
not me, that's really not me. My daughter's a doctor? | said, no. | don't deserve it.
Why God chose me to have a daughter a doctor? Why did he choose me for that?
What did | do right? | didn't do anything right. | didn't , NOW
through the years | probably did plenty of wrong things but by then | was twelve
years old. How much wrong could | have done? Why did He choose me and not
my sister or my brother? So all those things take you back for some reason, it just
takes you back. | have one son, my grandson is in Northwestern, such a
prestigious school. On the other hand I'm so thrilled that it's a free country, that
being Jewish that my kids could do whatever they want to do. | didn't, at least they
could do. And they could accomplish and they could go to the best schools and we
could afford to pay for them. So I'm blessed, I'm blessed but probably | took away, |
took with me the blessings for my family, for my brother. Whatever belonged to
them probably, | took it away. | wasn't selfish, it wasn't up to me. See, we are
screwed up people. With all the best in our lives. We are still screwed up people
and that's it. | mean, six years is a long time to suffer, a long time. | try to be good
to people, | give a lot of charities, a lot. | help, try to be helpful to people, doesn't
matter. Whoever comes in, they are homeless, | feel sorry for the homeless. |
always give them something. For Israel, for ZOA, forget about it. Ha-dassa (ph).
Always involved in something. It makes me happy.

Q: Well, thank you very much for talking and sharing your stories.

A: Your welcome. Well, at least this is | guess some of it, | think I'm sure there's
more to it. And when you think about it and you sit and say, if | did not tell this, why
| tell that? But it was funny, it's vague, it's mental even. | was laying down in front
of this building, the building was burning, | was halfway unconscious and here |
have my father standing in front of me. | mean, what is it? Fate, somebody was
watching over me? Well, he was asking people and they told him that this group is
here and this group is there, look here, look here, look there. And he was looking
all over. The building was burning and out of ten minutes | would have been on
fire. All of a sudden, he's there right in front of me. To schlep me on his back. To
save me. And there's other things, who remembers all those things? But | was,
from 1939 until really we run out of ghetto, | just, | was a smart child. | didn't want
to play with children, that's all | did, is reading, reading, reading, reading. Polish,
Hebrew then and Russian, from my parents. | didn't play with children. Even for
the two years when the Russians were there, | was also very unhappy. And
though, in America | am a happy person. People think I'm a very happy, outgoing
person. But certain things | don't remember. | was six months with those peasants,
when my father was in the partisans, and | remember nothing. | don't Know what |
ate there. | don't remember, | just remember sleeping on that oven and burning my

flesh, was burning. But the rest of it, and then when they came to pick me up. |
don't even remember when they left me there. | don't remember what | ate, what
did | do? They didn't keep me for nothing, | must have been either with the sheep
in the fields or helping, doing something with the kids. | must have. Nothing. And
chunks like this of my life, like they are just out. | don't know why. Completely out.
That's the story of a survivor, my dear. But unfortunately, every week is different
funerals. If Hitler would come up, would wake up now, and see that we still, we
have a lot of green-na (ph), survivors, who lived a long, long age and lived a
beautiful generation, left a beautiful generation of people, lawyers, doctors,
politicians, on television, he would drop dead again. And every time, | use to have
a speech, I'm good in those things, | have to get it out now. If Hitler would wake up
and see what we are doing here and the generation we left. We left, believing
beautiful people behind us. A beautiful generation. This is just the first generation,
how about the second generation? That will come up also, doctors and lawyers
and reporters and involved in politics. A really big, most of our kids are educated
people. Ninety-nine percent of our survivor's children are very highly educated. At
least a teacher, many more, many are a teacher. So | guess we'll never go. The
Jewish faith, the Jewish religion and Jewish people will survive, will survive. They
are supposed to be the chosen people, but | don't see it. Why pay such an
expensive price, | can't understand either? But Hitler didn't wipe us out. No way.
No way. No way. They are going to be alive and free and now we have to work for
Israel. Now we'll have to see that our generation and our second generation, third,
they should be all Judaism, should be aware, and really stand guard. | don't know
how, but they are educated people, like, God should give, Swen-ton Da-Yah-ho
(ph) is a young powerful man. God should give him the wisdom and lead us on the
right track and Israel should survive. And we are human people and we are people
In the world, the people who come up with us, that we are a Nation, we are a
People. And we have to survive like anybody, like any other Nation has to survive,
who God created. It doesn't matter, black, white, green or red. If God put us here
we should survive. And one should not kill the other. We should help each other.
So now we'll have see that Israel should survive, that's all. Thank you very much.
Q: Thank you very much.
