talked to each other like to your brother or sister, because that’s all — you are — you

are sitting here and — and you’re — you’re going. Going to the same place, going

hear about conditions in that.

A: In— we didn’t have any toilets, of course. The only thing, there was a hole in the

floor, and — and nothing else. No — no cover, no nothing, so — so how — how do you

do that? Some — some people had extra blankets. They somehow managed to h — to

hang it up, to — to cover —

Q: Hide it.

A: — make it private. So that was it. But, it was fro — freezing temperature. It didn’t

take long until that hole was all fr-frozen, and no more hole. So the only way you

because it wouldn’t — and can you imagine the mother, losing a child? So —

Q: Did this happen in your boxcar too?

A: No. Luckily, in our boxcar there was no dead person.

Q: Okay. But you saw in the other boxcars.

A: But we saw through that little window, once in a while, you know. Or sometimes

the door was opening, and they were carrying out from the other door. So they

didn’t consider people as people. To them was like animal carrying the — I’ve seen

so many dead, so many.

Q: What happened where you got — when did you — where did you end up? Where

did the train take you?

A: My 15 years old brother. And he walked all way to — to Shilova. Every night we

would stop in a village, Russian village, of the people that were also deportees from

the first — from the revolution —

Q: Really?

A: — Russian revolution. And at one house a woman, when she saw my mom, she st

— with the baby, she started crying. Apparently she had a baby too, and — when she

was deported, and now — now —

Q: She sees someone else.

A: — she — she sees one and she — she started t-telling my mother — my mother spoke

Russian, because she was through — through a couple, in German and — and Russian

occupations. So to — to my mother, the languages were not strange. And — and then

— then sh — we —I don’t know why she took us downstairs, but as we were walking

downstairs, there was a little curtain, and she opened that, and she showed a Blessed

Mother picture, and she says, I too believe in God. And didn’t — didn’t say much,

because they are afraid, you know, their — they were afraid. So — so — so we slept

there on the floor. They provided just floor because that’s all they had, probably one

bed for themselves, and — and nothing else. So that was our first night. Then s —

then I think we — we had like four or five — they’re in the book.

probably had enough powder or whatever, you know, to — to help him to heal and —

but that’s — that’s all she ca — she could do. But that woman was very helpful. Well,

I guess we — we met a lot of people on the way, good people. I cannot — cannot

complain. There were bad people, but those not necessarily were Russians. They

could be Polish. Because when they stole something, I don’t think the Russian

would carry, because — although, who knows? I don’t know.

otherwise — and like they appar — apparently expected that we did take enough food,

you know, for that.

Q: So when you get to Shilova, what is — what did you find there?

A: They put us in one room, two families. And the room was maybe a — like this

living room to — til — to here. From there maybe it’s even — this is ba — bigger. And

be, the — the length of it, and — and — and so much high — height, and — and so — so

that’s what my brother was supposed to — and I — I didn’t know until I read my

brother’s report when he — when he was getting into the army, Polish army. So — so

at that time, he wrote that he was not getting enough food, and they were cutting,

and that’s why he was getting sick being there.

Q: So that meant your — your older brother was working as an adult, even though he

was 15 years old.

mother left to buy food, and didn’t return before the train left. In other words, it — it

left without her.

would go out and you would shout.

couldn’t hold it, and — and she says, we — we don’t have nothing to eat, so — so she

is going. And she didn’t even listen to us, what we — now, of course, which mother

station your mother goes out to get the bread, and the train starts to move.

A: Yeah. And at — that day an — day, because each day they were saying that we

Q: It wa — and it’s — it’s what one has heard before, that very often the trains would

stop, and one of the family members would get out to get something, and then

they’d be left behind.

A: Yeah. But some of them catch up, and some don’t have luck. They couldn’t find

out — see, that was war, you know. They probably left when there was something —

they got probably clear from — from somebody. So — so that was not a pr — on

purpose for leave those, or leave that, you know, it was just happened. And — wait,

what else? Oh, and we were — when we were going down, and probably the first

longer stop for us was at the place that was Polish — Polish — oh my gosh, I knew all

those names and ev — whatever. Where — Polish government small office was there.

And so I went to report that we lost our mother, that Mother stayed in Vologda, and

gave the names, mine — Irka’s(ph) and mine, and we never heard of that, you know,

that anybody reported anything, you know. So she didn’t get that far.

Q: Did she have the money, or did you have any money”?

A: She had the money. She had nice fur lined coat that was very warm. And — and

she had our I.D., because without I.D. you couldn’t get — buy the bread. So — so my

on the train. But it didn’t happen. He stayed with the father, father died. And — and

our mother was on a — he said on a breck(ph). What is breck(ph)? I tried Russia —

Russian people, I tried Jewish people, I tried anybody I could imagine, if any knows

what is breck(ph)?

Q: Yeah, what is a breck(ph)?

A: The only thing I can imagine, it was a platform, maybe with some si-sides, or

maybe nothing. And — and they were on that breck(ph) with whatever they had on,

and with the wind, when train was going so fast, they would never survive if they

were standing on. So all people, like flies were freezing and falling off. And — and

somebody found my mother frozen, dead. And — and she — and — and she had all

these clothes on, all her documents. She saw, on my mother’s document there is two

little girls. She would get three portions of bread at the store, not one, and — and she

was probably only one, and she threw her clothes off, or just — just — no, she

probably ki — kept a— a coat. And — and — and she took my mother’s I.D.

Q: So — so you — you — you think this is what happened?

A: Right, because exactly everything the same, except — except only thing, where 1s

she from? And she was from Saint Petersburg. So at that time people were running

away from the war.

who had the same documents as your mother?

A: Right.

Q: Did you know this person’s real name?

A: No, it didn’t show, just that — that she — she traveled from Saint Petersburg.

Everything was the same except instead of from Arhanga(ph) Skyoblish(ph), or

from Brantowce, you know, that’s the only thing that was different. And I wrote to

—to American because it was through American that I was getting that inform-

information. And — and — and she — or — or — or Red Cross couldn’t get that

information.

January 28, 2015

A: Yeah. Okay, what — what was the next question?

Q: The next question is how did you eat, who took care of you?

A: Oh, a couple — couple men that were fluent in Russian and whatever, they wrote

— they took piece of paper, they wrote similar format, our names, and we could —

we could buy — or they could buy bread. On the train we had — my mom left a little

change purse. And — and that — that’s — that has a long story, too, because all of a

sudden we are looking for that change purse, and there is none. But then, a couple

days later, apparently parents noticed that the little girl too-took the change purse

from us, and she told them, put it back where you find it. Which 1s normally is said

by p-parents. And she did. All of a sudden I pa — I look, and at the top of that

container where it was, it’s — it still is. So— so we had some — I-I think I have also

how much I had, but so we used up that. And then when we went to that Polish

consulate, oh, I remembered, then they gave us 40 rubles.

Q: Okay.

A: So we had 40 rubles plus there was like in teens, I think, of the change. So — so

that lasted until we got to the Jalabad(ph), to that — that place, and — and then

[indecipherable] about, after I think couple days, they fed us, an-and gave us good

care. And then they send us to collective farm. And over there we were supposed to

wait for something to happen.

A: Orphanage or — or something. So after — after we got there, they just threw us out

at the station, at the end — end of life — li — at the end of line. So — so for two days

we stayed there, and we didn’t know what happen — will happen. Good thing we —

we had a good send out, you know, with a little food, but not enough for two days.

SO — SO we — we were eating, and there was a big mound of — it’s from maku(ph),

whatever the name that means. It’s from the seeds of bawelna — aye-aye-aye,

bawelna. That was — [indecipherable] bawelna?

Q: Sunflower? No.

sandy, sandy place. Well, maybe it’Il — it will come back. Ill — I will continue.

Whatever that — that was, we were — we would — 1-it wasn’t clean on top, so we

would clean up and eat that, and it was very bitter. But, you know, better than

nothing in your stomach. So — so somehow we survived that. And then next day

comes Kirghizian man, with the big whatever — didn’t look like a wagon or — or

anything. So we — we just walked behind him, told — tol — showed us, only we

go to this collective farm until we know what to do with you. Is that correct?

A: But they lost completely, because the army — because the ar — that was the army.

Q: Okay.

A: And — and I guess they were not the — concerned about us, they were concerned

more of those soldiers, because those soldiers came naked almost, you know, to join

the army, so — so they —

Q: When you said they lost completely, they — they completely forgot you, or they —

A: I think so, because nobody sh-showed up for us. Nobody ever knew wha — which

place we are, because even that Kirghizian man, when he came he just asked us if

we can go with him, so we went, because we didn’t have —

Q: Okay, but was this the place that you were supposed to go to?
