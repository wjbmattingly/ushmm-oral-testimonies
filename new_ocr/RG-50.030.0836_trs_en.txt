Q: Okay.
A: But they went to Mozambique, because they couldn’t get into Johannesburg.
Q: I see.
A: Johannesburg quota was closed, and so they went to Mozambique.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: Eventually, they got into Johannesburg, after the war.
Q: Okay. But nobody from the family, let’s say prior to World War I? Some people
had, for example, relatives in the United States who had emigrated for, not political
reasons, let’s say either economic reasons or — or they just wanted to leave Europe
in the early part of the century. Was that — did you have any relatives like that?
A: Yes, I—I found out lately, going through my father’s papers, that the gentleman
who sponsored us was the s — was a second cousin of my mother’s, who was born in
Germany, of German parents, obviously, decided to emigrate to the United States,
in the — in very late 80s. He was like six years old. Must have been 1889, or
something to that effect.

A: I had a wonderful childhood.
Q: Okay.
A: I was raised — my mother was a businesswoman, who had to take — very unusual
for a German so-called lady at the time.
Q: Yes.
A: Her parents had unfortunately passed away, and left a substantial business, and
she decided to take over, cause her brother, who was still very young, was not so
inclined.
Q: Okay.
A: And my father became involved in the business, and after she lost both parents, I

sausages, and major things.

block, it was pretty large. And it had a showroom with major machineries, small
article — knives and saws and forks and all kinds of things that butchers would use.
And then we had a warehouse in back of the store, where they had the major
machinery, so that people could see what it was like. But they — they had — they did
buy the smaller items, but all the larger items had to be — those were sample
machineries.
Q: So they had to be ordered. They had to be special or —
A: Oh, absolutely.
Q: — special ordered.
A: And the butchers they dealt with were both small, but there were also major,
major butchers.
Q: Such as?
A: Downtown Cologne, that would have butchers, the meats on one side, and
delicatessen on the other. Very, very upscale.

October 4, 2015
A: Probably, probably. I don’t know whether they had built it or not. She must have
had — oh, I don’t know, it was a very formal home. She had staff for help, and even
though she was widowed, lived very, very nicely.
Q: Okay. So, both sides of your family were comfortable, economically?
A: Yeah, comfortable.
Q: Okay. Okay. And, as you were growing up, did you visit her often, your
grandmother?
A: No, it was to — yes, we were — my nursemaid would take us, it was quite a ride —
Q: Okay.
A: — a train ride, to get there. And we would go once in a while. But because it was
such a formal lifestyle, and we, as children we were not too happy with visiting
grandma. Everything had to be absolutely ultra-perfect. You had to get dressed for
lunch, and dressed for dinner, and it was not our way of life, so —
Q: Okay. Things at — at your home were less — less formal.
A: Absolutely.
Q: Okay.
A: And if we didn’t go with our — the interesting thing was that we were sent with
our nursemaid, who was really like my second mother, so —

A: I got beautiful letters of hers.
Q: You do?
A: Yes, I do.
Q: Well, that’s unusual, still to have letters from a nursemaid.
A: Yeah. As a matter of fact, when I lost my husband, years later she had written
me a note saying, I can’t let you live alone. You need me to help you, and however
she had survived the war, and she wasn’t well herself, and she wanted to come with
a friend, and the two would live with me, and take care of me. But, unfortunately,
which I have really regretted, that I did — I— I wasn’t in a position to have two
people who had never been abroad, or —
Q: You don’t know who —
A: — very limited.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so — however, I did see her after the war.

recollections.
Q: So you had a reunion?
A: Yes.
Q: Was your family very religious?
A: I wouldn’t say very — we were traditional, and observant, yes. My mother was
religious, came from a religious family. My father was very Reform.
Q: Okay.
A: So however, he had to put up with, yes, we had a kosher home.
Q: That was one of my questions.
A: Yes. And interestingly enough — and this is — is quite unusual, because we were
in the business, we had two refrigerators at the time, one for dairy and one for meat.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: And people who came to our house could not believe — first of all, we had a very
large kitchen, we had help. And — but they could not — they had never seen people

A: For the time. Even the 30s, to have a refrigerator was a luxury.
Q: Well, tell me about your home that you grew up in. Was it a house, or an
apartment?
A: No. My parents, I think — I’m not sure whether it was 30 — I was born ’28, ’31, I
don’t know the date, but the build — there was a new building in this — in this
suburb, that was very close to the slaughterhouse, which was giant, blocks and
blocks and blocks. And it was — because of the slaughterhouse, it wasn’t a fancy
neighborhood.
Q: No, I wouldn’t imagine that it could be.
A: No. And a building went up, and my father decided to move the original store to
that new building, and customize the first floor of the building.
Q: You mean the ground floor, or the first floor as we’re talking —
A: No, first floor over the — over the business.
Q: Okay.
A: And customized it into a four bedroom apartment, which we had, with two and a
half baths.

people from Germany — often it was that they — these large, 19° century homes,
that had —

who had tons of friends.
Q: She sounds like a very modern person.

a straight, 100 percent German. [indecipherable] perfect.
Q: Okay.
A: A gentleman of distinction in his manner, in his dress, and everything he did was
perfect. There was no in-between. And it 1s interesting, because they were totally
opposites. And I — I assume, from what I saw, that they had a lovely marriage.
Q: Well, when you said that your grandmother had a strict home, where you had to

came up, and unfortunately my nursemaid had given my sister and I a Hanukkah
present, a Christmas present of a bicycle each.

that same morning was on a streetcar also, and we exchanged — he’s not Jewish, of

The two schools had two different buildings. And one of the buildings was on fire.
And needless to say, there was a little confusion in the courtyard. And the rector
spoke on a microphone and said, you are to try to reach your parents by phone. We
didn’t have cell phones, but there were telephones in — at school, or get on the next

all night, and we finally came to this town where we were supposed to be with
friends. My father got out of the car and went into a pub, to call his friend and say
we were close by. And the friend said, don’t come. The Nazis have just come into
my town, and you will not be safe here. Just keep driving. So we drove through the
whole night. And when we had to relieve ourself, there — couldn’t go anywhere, you
went — you made do. [indecipherable] And so we never got — we were nowhere.
And finally, early in the morning, we went back to our home. And that was the last
time I saw my house, my home.
Q: Really?
A: And my nursemaid was there, and we had dinner, whatever, and then we rented
an apartment somewhere. I don’t know where. I — I have very little recollection of
that time — that was November til January — because things were terrible. So, I don’t

know whether I have blocked that out of my mind completely. However, my father,
the next day that we got home, my father disappeared. Totally disappeared. And for
three days, we had no idea where, how, what. The Germans had taken him, and
thrown him into prison. Which was — every other man was taken off the street, for
whatever reason. No reason whatsoever, just pull him. Fortunately enough, the — he
had friends, an attorney, who got him out of jail. That was the first time. And after
that, things were terrible, because he had to go back to the business every day to try
to finalize plans. This was — then they were forced to sell the business. But what
happened during that time, I can’t tell you, except that my father was taken again,
oh, I think right in December, somewhere in December, and never knew how my
father got out of jail, until my mother was on her deathbed, and she said, I think I
ought to tell you something I have never revealed to anyone. So she told my sister
and myself how she managed to get my father, and I don’t think I ought to tell that
Story.
Q: Oh, you’ve piqued my curiosity. Can you go around it a little bit? Is there any
way —
A: Well, I— she found a way —

Q: Oh, dear.
A: — to engage the head Nazi in an evening. And my mother didn’t drink, but she
spent the night with this person at a bar. And every time she didn’t feel well, she
would relieve herself, and start drinking all over again, until he was — 1-it’s just too
involved.
Q: Okay.
A: However, he signed a paper in his stupor. She said to me the best part about this
story is that he invited her to go home, she’s a very attractive woman. And she said
she’d love to. And it got very involved. And she said, but the only way she would
consent is if he would be so kind, and give his signature, so that her girlfriends, who
were like herself — probably figured she was a lady of the night — her girlfriends
would never believe that he invited her. So, she took out a piece of paper, which
was a consent to have my father relieved from prison.
Q: Oh my gosh.
A: She had never told this story.
Q: Did you think he knew, your father?
A: I—I don’t know if he ever knew. I don’t know. And she — this was like just
before she died, she told me. So, I would say she — she was some lady.

Q: Yes. It is part of what was the reality, and what somebody had to do in order to
survive, and help a loved one get out.
A: I asked her, I said, how could you even think of doing this? And she said, when
you’re in need, you do whatever you have to. That was my mother.
Q: Amazing. Thanks. We’re going to break for lunch now. Thank you. [break]
Okay, so Susi, before the break, before the break, we were talking about
Kristallnacht, and the days immediately following it, and you mentioned that after
— after your — you drove around that night in the car, your father was picked up ag —
yet again, and you shared with us how your mother got him out. And I wanted to
explain a little bit why I wanted to know this detail, simply because people should
not have only a sanitized version of what others went through in order to survive.
And that often, you had to make a tough decision. Now your mother told you this
only on her deathbed. Can you tell me what kind of thoughts ran through your
mind? How — how you reacted to it? You had said before the break that it gave you
something, it taught you something.
A: Well, I — I think that by example, my mother sh — enriched my life, because no
matter how difficult times were for her, 1t was her personality that was positive.
And any — no matter what challenges she had, she would go at it in a very positive

she would do things that we would say would be silly, or crazy. And I’m sure that’s
the way she vented her difficulties.
Q: By — by finding something about it.
A: I think so.

A: And it seemed that friends would gravitate to her, because she had this charm. I-

Q: You do? Wow. You still have that?
A: Yeah, it’s downstairs in the locker room, but I have it. And we were — the next

Q: Tell me, what — what happened then?
A: Well, in the train, I guess I finally realized. Everybody was talking, and we were
in a compartment with other children. And the next thing I knew, my sister tells me
that I was a crybaby. I was very petite, and she was — she was very grown, very
mature for her age. And so I said to her whatever, something didn’t please me, and I
started to cry. And I cried and cried and cried. And she said, you better stop crying,
because nothing’s going to help you, there’s no one here to help, we’re just the two

continue to cry, you’ll — they’Il take you and throw you off the train. So you better
make up your mind to stop crying. I think that’s the last time I cried. So —

lovely home, they were young. They had two young children, and they had a home
in Amstelveen, it was a very upscale suburb. And he buried whatever my parents
gave him, in his backyard. And he had a— a map made of the actual spot of where

Q: The S.S. Rotterdam. Now, before we started this interview, off camera, 1t was
mentioned to me that I should ask you about a 13 year old boy.
A: It is at — this is at the propitious moment.
Q: Oh really? Okay, so tell me about this.
A: The day we left out of Rotterdam, we were just outside of the boat area, guess
we were having lunch. And all of a sudden, my little friend, Danny Appel(ph), 13
years old, and I was 11, comes with one rose to bid me goodbye. How he knew I
was going, I have no idea. I have his picture, I’ll show it to you. So —
Q: Who is Danny Appel(ph)? Tell me.
A: Danny Appel(ph) was a little boy that I met in — in the group we were in, in
Holland.
Q: Okay.
A: He had also been on a children transport.
Q: Okay.
A: But he was very short for his age, and I was very petite, so we were the two little
kids, always. And he came to Rotterdam to wish me farewell, and he gave me a
little photo, and with a little note in the back saying, for — remember me, your
friend, Danny.
Q: Okay.

A: So that happened the last day of my — prior to getting onboard ship. Now, about
five years ago, or four years ago, this doctor, Dr. Keesing gets my name through an
organization here that’s — the Kindertransport has an organization. I went to one
or two meetings, and find out about Dr. Keesing.
Q: Okay, so we’re going — at this point I’m going to interject and say that, we’re
talking about — now jumping ahead to about 2010, and Dr. Keesing 1s — tell us who
she is, and —
A: Okay. And this is all pertaining to Danny Appel(ph).
Q: Got it.
A: Dr. Keesing is a professor at a university in Holland, who is —
Q: Today.
A: Today. Who is documenting the 2000, quote, illegal children that came into
Holland.
Q: Okay.
A: And I — through this organization, I heard her name, I emailed her, and she
emailed me back, all of which I have documented, wanting to know where I was,
what happened to me. And she writes me this — all of this information of the
documents of my entry, the documents of my exit of Holland. She had already
documented me, she knew all about me. But she’s trying to figure out how this all

happened. So, on our second or third email, I said, with all the work you’re doing, I
have been thinking about a young man by the name of Danny Appel(ph), and I had
no response. I can’t figure it out, because previously she emailed me back right
away. One evening I am by myself, right here, and the phone rings. And a
gentleman is on the other line, and he said he’d like to speak to me, and was I in
Holland, blah, blah, blah. And I’m sure that this 1s a hoax. So I said, I’m terribly
sorry, but I don’t know who you are, and I’m going to hang up the phone. And he
said, no, no, no, no, no, he said, I forgot to mention Dr. Keesing gave me your
number. Well, with that I knew whoever this person was. It turned out to be Danny
Appel(ph) —
Q: Wow.
A: — who is no longer Danny Appel(ph). He was — he remained in Holland at the
beginning of the war, but when he was — the entrance into Holland, his German
passport, he was Rudolf Appel(ph), that was his name. He changed it to Daniel,
Danny for short. That’s what he was known by. So when I’m asking for Danny, he
is no longer Danny, he jar — he joined the French underground —
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: — and survived in France, under Danny. He — he finally gets a visa to come to
the United States, and his passport is Rudolf, so he has to change his passport back

to Rudolf. And I said to him, I have your picture, and he said, I can’t believe it. So I
went, enlarged the picture, send it to him. And my children said, Mom — this was in
February, so my children said, get on a plane and go to New York. I said no, it’s
wintertime, I’m not doing that. So that summer, I did just that.
Q: Did you?
A: And we reunited after 70-some odd years.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: So —
Q: I mean, the — the — the circles, as they’re coming full circle, you know?
A: Right. And it turns out that he survived the war, and so did his mom, whom he
did not know was alive, and he lives in New York. He married a na — a lady by the
name of Suzy(ph).
Q: Oh.
A: And he has two daughters, and he was alive and well. However, we have been
calling each other to say hello. I called him for the holidays. I called him three
times, and left a message, and I have not heard. So I make the assumption that
[indecipherable] something’s not right there.
Q: Well, what a — what a gift, you know, so many decades later, to find the boy who
gave you the rose, right before you leave.

A: And he is very involved with Dr. Keesing, because all his gentlemen, all his boy
friends who survived, he was able to give Dr. Keesing the information where they
are, what happened to them.
Q: Wow, wow.
A: So he’s been involved.
Q: So let’s go on the Rotterdam, as you’re crossing the ocean. Do you have
memories of that crossing?
A: Absolutely, it was lovely.
Q: Yeah?
A: It was lovely except for one unfortunate situation. A lady passed away on board
ship. And my mother, being Orthodox, offered her services, and volunteered to take
care of the deceased, which is a Jewish custom. And my sister and I, who never had
heard of this, didn’t know anything about it, we, both of us refused to have anything
to do with my mother, because she’d been with —
Q: A dead person.
A: So until we understood —
Q: What that involved.
A: — what a privilege, what she had done, which we had no idea.

A: Oh yes.
Q: Okay.
A: Yes, definitely. We landed in New York, we were met by a distant cousin,
young, young guy, who had been sent to New York by Zeiss camera company as
an intern from Germany, and never went back. He’s in his like, middle 20s. And he
came to the ship to greet us, to tell us that unfortunately, we could no longer go to
L.A. All our things went to L.A., and some clothes went to L.A., and we were not
prepared for winter, except what we had on our bags. But the gentleman who has
sponsored us, who was a Chicagoan, had a brother in L.A. Apparently he didn’t
want us in Chicago, so he suggested the climate would be better, whatever reason.
However, unfortunately, the brother had a massive heart attack the week that we
arrived, and could no longer —
Q: Help.
A: — help us. So we went from New York by Greyhound bus on 20 dollars that we
had, and for two days of — of the trip, we each shared a half a sandwich, every place
we went. A half a cheese sandwich. But we got to Chicago.

one room for the four of us. And — not in downtown Chicago, in a very nice South
Side of Chicago, where most of the German people gravitated to.

but we had our clothes made. And so I had a little suit on, and a little sweater that I
wore every day, and a raincoat over it. And big boots, we all wore boots, which
were not in fashion here, at the time. And it was a very, very cold, snowy day, and a
limousine drove up to the school, that — school was — some of the more comfortable
people were there, you know, ordinary, middle class. And a limo moved — pulled up
in front of school, and a few of the kids we — and a little kid who was in my class, I

lovely woman.
Q: Oh my —
A: Magnificent home. And she had us for lunch, and then drove us back. And she
said, why did you come in the limo? And I said, we had a chauffeur at home. There
wasn’t anything special. As long as you were sitting there, I figured why not? What
do I got to lose? I mean, all the other kids were going. Turns out this lady had three
sons, she never had a daughter. So, few days thereafter, she picks up the telephone,
and — we didn’t even have a telephone, about a year later, she picks up the phone,
and she calls my mother and she said, I am so crazy about your little girl. Could I
adopt her?
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: And my — my mother said, are you crazy? However, this lady was someone I
kept in touch with. We used to sit next to each other at the opera. I really kept in
touch with her for a long time.

Major, major building, 15 floors, a big building in Chicago, on LaSalle Street. And
we came, and he didn’t offer my mother a seat in his office. And my father was so
infuriated that no — my mother kept saying, he saved our lives, it’s nothing, don’t
worry about it. Well, he didn’t offer my dad a job. Here he is, the whole thing, the
whole building was not all his, but he had like 10 floors. Give him a job as a
Sweeper or something. So — but he said that, in his factory outside of Chicago, like
an hour and a half, they could use somebody. So that’s where my dad started, and
he was there for about four months, and he said, I can’t do this, it’s not for me.
Q: And so he had to find work on his own.
A: So he — he decided to find whatever job he could. And his first job in Chicago
was as a dishwasher in a restaurant. And it was his first paycheck — this will show

Q: Okay.
A: My father said, I will never step foot in that country again. They didn’t do right
by me, and they can keep their reparation. However, when he realized what he had
missed, because his friends were all being well taken care of, he decided to get in
contact with the attorney who had handled the business deal, who was alive and
well. I have all o — I have a ledger this big of every correspondence that went on, for
three years — or two years, I’m not sure. I have it all. I just went through it the other
day, it’s amazing.
Q: And so what was the end result?
A: So the attorney kept suggesting my father come, that without his acknowledging
all this. And finally, about, I would say, nine months before the end of the period
where you could claim, my father decided to go to Germany. And by the time all
the papers were claimed, he could — he nee — the date had expired — th — the time for
that particular law — there were different laws of personal — regarding business. And
the German who bought, fought the case. He fought the case. And so my father
never got anything pertaining to business. However, they did get reparation. Not as
much as anybody else did. And I have stuff showing what they got. I think they — I
—I don’t know, I’d have to look it up, I think they got something like 500 dollars a
month, or 300 dollars a month. Maybe was three. I could look that up, I don’t know.

Germans are saying they’ve had enough about they had to be educated on the
Holocaust. They no longer want this to be part of the school curriculum. I don’t
know whether that’s a fact.
Q: Okay.

Interview with Susi Frank Annes
October 4, 2015
A: But —
Q: It sounds like very much a mixed bag, a mixed bag of reactions and impressions
and feelings about wis — would that be accurate?
A: Well, I don’t think I met the average person. So, I would not be able to qualify
that.
Q: Okay.
A: Because the type of people I met had all been involved with people like myself.
They were educated. And I don’t think that’s — that’s the case. However, I did have
another interesting experience I’d like to share with you, in Israel.
Q: Sure, please.
A: I was on a trip to Israel, not with George, on another trip to Israel, and I went to
the Holocaust museum, of course.
Q: Yad Vashem.
A: Right. And by myself, I went into the gift shop. And I’m walking through the
gift shop, and I see four women, young, in their early 20s, and they’re speaking in
German. So, I’m fascinated. I was — went over, introduced myself in German, and I
said, forgive me, but I’m curious. What are you doing in Israel? And this one lady
turned to me and she said, I know so little about the Holocaust. She said, I’m doing
my master’s in education, and we all came here to be educated. She looked at me

and she said, and what are you doing in Israel. And I — of course, I answered her,
and she said, you lived through Hitler’s time? I mean, she was like — she couldn’t
believe it. She said, I— when were you born? She started — 1t was some engagement
that I had with them. It was very interesting. Had I not approached them —
Q: You wouldn’t have — you wouldn’t have had it, you wouldn’t have known.
A: No, and here there are educated people coming to Israel to study, learn. So, one
never knows.
Q: I wanted to, on this question, still talking about post-war, and ha — your — your
feeling, and your relation to Germany, we jumped ahead to more recent times, but
the first time you saw your nanny, after the war. Tell me about that. Tell me how
you got to see her again.
A: It was glorious. It was —
Q: All right, what were the circumstances?
A: Well, we had her come, as our guest, to the hotel we were staying at.
Q: And where was this? What ca —
A: In Amsterdam.
Q: Uh-huh, so you were in Amsterdam.
A: And we just talked til all hours of the night, and we recalled so many wonderful
happenings that we had shared throughout the years. And she had corresponded

after the war with my mother, all the time. But you know, I had young kids, I
wasn’t interested, or — I think I sent Christmas cards or something, but nothing on a
very personal basis. So, it was a glorious two days. My poor husband was, I’m sure,
bored to tears, cause we spoke German all the time. And it was —
Q: How did —
A: — beyond my expectation.
Q: Did she fill you in on what her life had been like, from the time you said
goodbye to her?
A: I think she did, but I don’t recall very much. She had an injury during — I think
during the war she fell, if I remember correctly. And she had — she worked in some
kind of office position, but she couldn’t walk very well. So I don’t think her life was
too wonderful.
Q: We’re coming to the end of the interview. Can — 1s there anything else you
would like to share with us, that you’d want other people to know about, about your
experience? And this can be either episodes, or some of the thoughts that have gone
through your mind, that you’ve wondered about. Some of the ways you’ve
interpreted what you went through, what you saw, and so on?
A: Well, I have always — the — my — my temple has asked me to speak several
times. And I — I have always feel that perhaps I was too young to realize what was

really going on. I didn’t have the burden of all the hardship. I was — I was well
taken care of until Kristallnacht. And I felt my childhood was absolutely glorious,
lovely. I mean, I had as lovely a childhood as I wanted my children to have. But we
— we definitely had values in our family. We had religion in our family. And I have
felt very grateful that — we talk about it a lot, especially when the holidays come
about. Because most of my friends are not so inclined. And I love to go to services,
I enjoy it, I— something very personal that I get out of it. And I think my — my
children are involved, but not to the extent that I am. They are — I always feel they
do things cause they know it means a lot to me. They do go to services, but not on a
regular basis, you know. But that’s fine. They have their value system, I have mine.
So I have been — I have always said, I’m so grateful that I had the kind of parents I
had, cause I was given values that have served me well, and I — you learn very early
on in life, I was very independent, and I’m very particular about friends I choose.
And I — I’ve always been. I mean, I didn’t have a lot of girlfriends, but if I had one
— this lady just that called, we’re friends 55 years.
Q: Wow.
A: And I have another one in Chicago, it’s 56 years. So it’s — I think I have been so
grateful. I’ve had a lovely life. I— I believe that every person, up to an extent, I
realize that, but we have the ability to create a la — a lifestyle, no matter what milieu

we’re in. But the style we create is something that I think I really inherited from my
mom.
Q: What a great tribute to her.
A: And I learned a great deal from both of them.
Q: Yeah. Well, Susi, thank you very much. Thank you for sharing your story, thank
you for painting such wonderful pictures with your descriptions of the various parts,
the various episodes, the impressions that you had. I — I’m very grateful, and this
has enriched our knowledge of this huge, huge, monumental event, that still why —
reverberates today. And with that, I’d like to say, this concludes the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with Mrs. Susi Frank Annes, on
October 4", 2015, in Palm Beach, Florida. Thank you.

Okay, this is a document that tells my parents — it’s — it’s — 1t’s to my mother, that
the children who are going on this children transport, where to drop them off at the
main train station, and the time. And be sure that they have a special number on the

called — inoculation in a separate envelope. Be sure they have the inoculation and
the birth certificate, in a special envelope.
