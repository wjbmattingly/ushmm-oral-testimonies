>> Peter Black: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum. My name is Peter Black. | am the Senior Historian at the museum and the host
of today's First Person, and | thank you very much for joining us.

We're in the 12th year of our program now, and our guest today is, I'm very happy to
announce, Mr. Gerald Schwab, whom we will meet very shortly. And you will excuse me; I've known
Gerry for over 15 years now, and | will just call him Gerry. Gerald sounds like a stranger to me.

I'd like to make a few announcements first, and give you some background on the program.
This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith
Foundation, to which we are grateful again for sponsoring First Person.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during this era. Each guest serves as a volunteer here
at the museum. Our program is going to continue, as it does every year, until about the middle of
August. The museum's website, at www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of the
upcoming First Person guests.

Gerry is going to share with us his First Person account as a Holocaust survivor for about 40
minutes, if time allows towards the end of the program we'll have an opportunity for you to ask him a
few questions.

The life stories of the Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Gerry is just one individual's account of the Holocaust. What I'd like to do for you as an
introduction is to show you a brief slide presentation to give you the outlines of Gerry's career and life.

Gerry was born in a small town outside of Freiburg, Germany, and his father, David Schwab,

owned an international plumbing supplies business. There's the location. The arrow points a little bit
further to the center of Germany than it should. He actually grew up in a town very close to the Rhine
River and the French border.

In this photograph is a picture of the school that Gerry attended, and this was a public school,
and Gerry was the only Jewish child in that school. This photograph was taken in 1932, one year
before the Nazis came to power, and Gerry is sitting in the middle row at the far right, next to the
teacher.

This next slide shows Gerry's family, somewhat later, after the Nazis came to power. Gerry's
parents are here, and his sister Margot, who had the good fortune to get to the United States already
in the 1930s.

This is a very important document, to which Gerry is determined to return, and he'll have my
head if we don't return to it. This document was issued to Gerry's father, and as you can see on the
lower right, though you may not be able to read the signature, it's signed by Adolph Hitler himself.
Gerry's father was a war veteran, and as late as 1935, the date here is May 3, 1935, Hitler personally
signed certificates honoring, giving the Cross of Honor to World War | veterans in Germany,
regardless of whether they were Jewish. I'll let Gerry explain its significance later on.

On the night of November 9-10, 1938, justifying their actions with the death of a German
consular official, wno had been assassinated a couple of days earlier, the Nazi leadership ordered out
the rank and file of the party, the SS and the Storm Troopers, to make an open season against the
Jewish population. Some 91 persons were killed; at least, that's what the records say. 267
synagogues were burned down, and over 15,000 Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed

within the space of about 36 hours.

Gerald's father was one of up to 30,000 Jews arrested in the day after the violence, and sent to
one of Germany's three concentration camps at the time. He went to Dachau, outside of Munich.

He was released shortly after, on the expectation that he would leave Germany as soon as
possible. Gerry's dad and his mom, seeing that Germany was no longer a place where Gerry could
be safe, were prescient enough to send him to Switzerland. He was one of a group of 280 children
sent to Switzerland in late 1938, early 1939, and Gerry will tell you in more detail about that
experience. He also came back to Germany briefly to pick up his visa and emigrate to the United
States in 1940.

Before he finished high school, there's a photograph of Jews arrested in southern Germany,
before deportation to Dachau. Gerry traveled with a pass. His name was Gerd. Gerald is an
anglicization of the German name Gerd. He traveled with a pass, and he sported one of the new
passes, passports, that were demanded by the Swiss authorities. The initiative came from
Switzerland. They wanted to know who coming from Germany or Austria, which was incorporated by
Germany in March of 1938, was Jewish. The Germans were only too willing to accommodate, and
this is the meaning of this big red J on the passport, which stands for Juda, the German word for Jew.

Now, Gerry came to the United States and, before he could finish high school, volunteered to
serve in the US Armed Forces, and went over and saw combat, pretty severe combat in Italy.

After the war, after leaving military service, he was assigned as a civilian to the Nuremberg war
crimes detachment, and there participated in several of the interrogations of top German generals.
This photograph here shows Gerry on your right, prosecutor's assistant Robert Kempner facing the

camera, and with his back to the camera is the infamous German general Gerd von Runstedt, who
had led the final German offensive in the west in the Arden Forest, which led to the Battle of the
Bulge in late 1944.

With that, | would like to introduce to you Gerry Schwab, and also note that his wife Joan
Schwab, who is also a survivor of the Holocaust, came over to England in a Kindertransport, or
transport of children, in 1939, is also here to watch the program.

Thank you very much. Gerry?

[Applause]
To be honest with you, not even 2% of the whole story. 2%.

Gerry, tell us a little bit about your childhood. How big was the town you grew up in? What
were your relations with -- you were the only Jewish kid in town. What were your relations with other
folks in town, kids and adults, and tell us a little bit about your parents, your father's profession, and
their connections with Germany as their chosen country.
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, | was born like everybody else, and went to school in Germany, in a town
called Freiburg, which is not all that small, about 100,000. It's on the edge of the Black Forest. |
guess we were sort of a middle class. My father had a business, which was based partially in
Germany, partially in Switzerland, and also a branch in France. This sounds a lot more impressive,
but consider that these three countries were all about a mile apart. It's on the edge near where the
Rhine River makes that bend. If you're across the river, you're in France. If you go the other
direction, you go into Switzerland.

The Nazis came to power in 1933. That's when life changed.

>> Peter Black: How old were you then?
>> Gerald Schwab: In 1933 | was the ripe old age of 8 years. We went to Switzerland. The business,
the warehouse that we had was in the city of Basel. Anybody has been in Switzerland might have
been there. The Swiss were willing, we were able to get there, but they weren't willing to give you
residency, So we moved a mile across into France. | had the pleasure then to switch, at age 8 or 9, to
a French school.

We stayed there a couple of years, didn't seem to work too well, and for reasons which are
really due -- how should | say? Too difficult to explain. Let me put it this way: My father used to,
later on, say "We get too soon old and too late smart." We moved back to Germany. And that
document that Peter pointed out had some effect on that.

We then moved to another German town, smaller town, called Lurag, separated from
Switzerland by a streetcar. That gives you an idea how far it was. And lived there. Now, what
happened, of course, is things immediately got more difficult for Jewish inhabitants.

Last night | had the fortune of digging through my files. | came up with the list of anti-Jewish
laws in Germany, and the first one which | have listed here was on April 11, 1933, that's basically
immediately after the election, and over a period of years, there were 150, at least 150 laws designed
to make life more difficult for Jewish inhabitants.

lf you wonder how they could pass that many laws, very simple, there's one guy at the top who
signed it, and that was it. In fact, by the time we left Germany in 1940, 166 laws. These are some of
them rather small ones. Germans were very good. They had laws, and they amended them, and
amended them, and amended them. Some of them were serious. | mean, for instance, who could be

a veterinarian. Others, on the other hand, were a lot more serious unless you were, of course, if you
were a veterinarian that one was very serious.
>> Peter Black: Can you say, Gerry, can you tell the audience about how some of this legislation
affected you after you returned to Germany, but before you left for Switzerland?
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, it affected my parents more than, obviously, me. | went to a German
school. The laws were increasingly difficult for Jewish inhabitants.

In 1935 you had the famous Nuremberg Laws, which made it illegal to have any close
relationship between German Aryans and Jews.

At age 10, that really didn't affect me terribly much. But over time things became increasingly
difficult.

Then came the Olympics, 1936, when things eased off, although some of these signs "Jews
aren't wished here" or park benches that said "Only for Jews" or "Jews are prohibited from using"
were removed. They came back after the Olympics were over. And my father's business became
increasingly limited, certainly the German part of it, but he was still able to drive to Switzerland and
sell his products.

In 1938 there came an event which Peter referred to, the assassination of a German third
secretary of the -- the German embassy in Paris, by a Jewish kid whose parents had lived in
Germany since, | believe, 1911. They came from Poland initially and escaped to Germany at that
time, because the father wasn't anxious to be drafted into the army.

His parents, in 1938, were sent to -- well, they were pushed across the border into Poland,

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
saying "You're not Germans." In fact, nobody who came into Germany after early 1900s was
considered a German. So they were either stateless or retained their Polish citizenship.

They were pushed across the border. They wrote a postcard to their son, who was living
illegally with an uncle in Paris, and went into the German embassy, saw the third secretary, the low
man on the totem pole, and killed him. He did not try to escape. He was French. And in Germany
this was the excuse that they really needed.

They forced -- well, they basically, how should | say? They made the most of it. Jewish
property was confiscated. Families had to pay -- Jews in Germany, large fines. The fact that
hundreds and hundreds of stores, Jewish-owned stores, the windows had been destroyed. They had
to have repaired at their own expense. Of course, in the meantime, they'd also been kicked out of the
German insurance firms. It was really bad.
>> Peter Black: Gerry, do you remember the night your dad was arrested?
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, that was one of the first things that happened. My parents went from Lurag,
where we lived at that point, to Freiberg. Obviously, somebody recognized him on the street, and he
was arrested there and sent off to Dachau concentration camp.

My mother, who was not a bad driver, drove the car back to our home. Obviously, a complete
nervous wreck. | can't blame her. You didn't know where the people were sent, but as Peter
mentioned, about 30,000 of them, 10,000 each to three concentration camps, Buchenwald, Dachau
and Sachsnaw.
>> Gerald Schwab: Thank you. The most direct effect in our family was this one Jewish kid in this
one school was told he shouldn't show up any more. | was kicked out. Now, let me point out that this

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
was not a tragic matter, as far as I'm concerned.
[Laughter]
Especially since | was about to flunk Latin. My mother didn't see it quite that way. My father was in
concentration camp about eight weeks. He came out. Keep in mind, this was November, December,
Dachau was a concentration camp near Munich, city of Munich, and he was in really bad shape.
Frostbite, he had all sorts of serious medical problems.

My mother wrote to -- in the meantime, after Kristallnacht, this by the way is called Kristallnacht
because, obviously, a lot of glass or crystal was broken. Some of the stores -- they didn't limit them,
people didn't limit themselves to breaking glass. They decided to clean out the exhibits, too. So she
wrote to an organization and asked, Can't you take my kid? Interestingly enough, about 10 years ago
somebody wrote the Swiss authorities, and within three days we had a copy of my mother's letter.
That's why | remember what she said.

The reason she did is that shortly after the -- shortly after the Crystal Night, the British
government said, We will take 10,000 Jewish kids. As a former US bureaucrat, | must say it was
amazing how fast they did it. They had something called the children's transports. They moved kids
out, as Peter mentioned. This is how my wife, who was born in Berlin, got out of Germany. And |
was one of about 280 people who ended up in -- they said right to the Swiss authorities. Well, my
mother did, and | ended up being moved to Switzerland.
>> Peter Black: What did you do there? What did you do once you got to Switzerland?
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, the big thing is | found out very quickly | am not somehow born to be a
farmer.

[Laughter]
| ended up in this Swiss village of, | believe, about 350 inhabitants, and there was a farm. They had
nine cows -- eight cows, some land around it. The village is in the center, then you have property in
the outside, and the farmer, | must say, | appreciate it now more than then, they wanted to help me.
But they figured that | would be happiest if | worked. They had lost a child about two years earlier. |
was expected to take their place.

As | say, it was not a very happy marriage. | learned how to milk cows. This was before the
milking machine, by the way. That's quite an experience. | went into the barn, and the horse kicked
me across the barn on the first time | went in. It didn't help matters.

Anyhow, | stayed there, and stayed until about October, November of 1939. In the meantime,
of course, the war had broken out. At that point, | was transferred. Somebody had pity on me, and |
ended up with a fundamentalist Christian family, and | must say they were absolutely wonderful.
They did not try to proselytize, they tried to help me in any way they could. Of course, the village,
which is outside of Zurich, was also very small, but | stayed with them until May of 1940.

In the meantime, during this period after Kristallnacht, Jews were no longer permitted to have
automobiles or drivers’ licenses. And as a result -- or Jewish males couldn't. My father could no
longer conduct business in Switzerland. And by that time, everybody realized it's time to get the
hell -- the heck out of there.

The Germans were reluctant to let you go at that point, if they thought you had foreign
currency or property overseas, outside of Germany. In fact, there was a law, there was a law that it
was punishable if you did not -- anything against Jews at that period of time, we're talking about some

pretty heavy punishment, concentration camps, etc.

We were not allowed to have property or funds outside the country, and in order to get the
heck out of Germany you had to have permission. Well, until the Germans were convinced that you
no longer had any access to foreign currency, they wouldn't give you the permission.

Now, people may wonder over this whole period of time why Jews didn't just get out of
Germany. Well, the young people at that point, who had not established a business or something,
something equivalent, they left in 1933. And if you look at the statistics, it started there, and the
number of Jews leaving Germany decreased year after year after year, until November 1938, at
which point it shoots up. That's when everybody really got the idea.

The reason Jews did not leave Germany in as large number as one might wish or wonder was
the very fact that, A., some people figured this thing is going to pass, this is a temporary thing, Hitler
is going to go like so many former governments in Germany. And then, of course, there was a big to
do about German ex-soldiers who had been -- not only were soldiers, but had fought on the front. My
father, during World War |, was wounded three times, and as we saw in this document, in 1935, two
years after Hitler came to power, he still got an award. Obviously, many felt nothing would happen to
them.

And then there was the third group that felt that they just couldn't leave. They had fought for
the Kaiser, and some of the older people especially felt this was the only country they'd known, and
they wanted to stay this way.
>> Peter Black: Gerry, when the visas came through, for your folks and for you, tell folks about how
you went back to Germany and then how you got out of Germany.

>> Gerald Schwab: Well, my parents called. The Germans had finally decided that they could leave,
and we had got a visa, or had registered for a visa, to come to the American consulate in Stuttgart.
Some of the ex-Gls here, they remember that town. We went there. | was called back. | gota
special visa to get back into Germany.

We sat there in the waiting room of the consulate, and | pointed out to my mother, "Look." In
the German newspaper, it said silly propaganda, the German troops are amassing on the borders,
and it's just propaganda, it's not true.

Well, the date that we got our visa was May 10, 1940. On May 10, German invaded Holland,
Belgium and France, or attacked France. Up to then, they had something called the Sitzkrieg War,
and that's when the war in -- European war really started.
>> Peter Black: You physically got out through Italy, right?
>> Gerald Schwab: Yes. We got our visa on the 10th. | think we went back to our town on the 11th,
and | think we probably left on the 12th. Went to Italy, came to the States from Genoa, and
fortunately the Italians declared war on the French, and the Brits, while we were at sea. Because,
otherwise, that way of getting out of Germany would have -- well, at that point, it became impossible
to get out of Germany. So anyhow, we got to the States.
>> Peter Black: You were a teenager by the time you got to the States, right?
>> Gerald Schwab: Oh, yes. | certainly was a teenager. | was -- | went to school, went to junior high,
and end up with -- | lost some time in between. Now we're beyond the Holocaust period as far as
we're concerned. My parents, father had previously, as | said, been a businessman. He opened up a
poultry farm in central New Jersey. Any New Jerseyites here? Here? And | grew up for a couple of

years in Hightstown, and at that point my father told the draft board that | was an essential worker and
asked for deferment. | called the draft board and said, "Don't you dare do this again." | was afraid |
was going to miss this whole thing.

Then, at that point then, | got into the army, spent a glorious period of time in Camp
Blanding, Florida. | can use some cynicism, can't I?
[Laughter]
And went to Italy, and became a member of the 10th Mountain Division. To answer anybody who
wants to know whether | did any skiing there, no. We had ski uniforms, but we -- | never skied there.
>> Peter Black: You saw some pretty severe combat.
>> Gerald Schwab: We saw some combat, yeah. That one picture, by the way, of me with Field
Marshal von Runstedt, there he is, it was an interesting experience. | had been -- actually, at that
point | was a civilian wearing an Eisenhower jacket. | did wear my combat hat. That's the one thing
we were proud of in addition to that. It was worth $10 a month, if you had one of those.

After the end of the war | was transferred to an intelligence operation in Austria, and when time
came to leave the army | was not an ideal soldier. In other words, | couldn't be a soldier nor a farmer.
| ended up, as a civilian, at Nuremberg.

Now, may | ask one question? How many of you know of the Nuremberg Trials? Quite a few.

In this day and age, cable TV, we have trials of the century all the time, nowadays. Well, the
Nuremberg Trial was the trial of the century, because just about every surviving major German figure,
except for Hitler and Goebbels, who committed suicide, were on trial there. Gerring, Hess. | was the
interpreter, translator. Somebody is bound to say, This kid? 20, 21 years of age? How could he?

Well, as we say, In the land of the blind, the one-eyed is king. If you speak English and you
speak German, this is it. So | spent, well, about six months at the first trial of the major German war
criminals, had some interesting experiences there. | worked primarily with the German general staff.

Here | was a corporal dealing with field marshals. One particular time | looked over, | was in
what we'd call here the greenroom, | was waiting to go on, and the next witness was standing there, it
was Field Marshal Kesselring, who had been the head of the German Air Force and also on the
Italian front. So this corporal spoke with that field marshal about the Italian war. He asked me where
| learned my German. | figured he had enough problems. He didn't need to know where | would tell
him. But in his particular case, | did. He was personally a nice individual. So | told him.

His response was, "They must be really satisfaction to be working here." The only thing |
could say "You're right, field marshal." What else could you say?
>> Peter Black: Gerry, before we open it up to questions, there's one more anecdote from this period
that you have to talk about, and that was about that SR leader from your hometown.
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, actually, he was the SA leader for -- the SA was a major Storm Troopers,
was a Nazi political organization which endangered Hitler's wanting to work with the army, and in
1934 you had the famous massacre of the leadership of the SA. And after that, the SA never again
was anything of consequence.

They never had a position that the head was chief of staff. Well, the chief of staff had the
misfortune of having an automobile accident in 1943. | think his car was shot up by fighter planes,
and so the deputy, he was at the Nuremberg Trials as a witness. He wasn't tried there.

He wanted to know -- let me explain. | was working in the section where the proceedings were

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
to collect information for the main trial, and you had one interpreter doing both German and English.
The main trial, of course, was held in four different languages: German, French, Russian and
English. But in this particular section it was only German and English, and instead of having a whole
bank of interpreters, they had one person who did both, German-English, English-German. Which,
by the way, resulted in a number of problems. When German field marshals started talking about
some of their experience and so on, | -- what did | know? | didn't Know the German. | didn't know the
English. But! got through.

This particular individual, head of the SA, which had been instrumental in destroying Jewish
synagogues, stores, during Crystal Night, was trying to convince the hearing, or the people in charge
of the hearing, that all they did was try to protect property. Didn't spell out which property, but it was
basically all property. And he wanted to know where | learned my German. | decided, No way. And |
refused.

Finally, the guy got on my nerves, after he had been talking about the work of the SA during
Crystal Night, and | told him. | learned my German in Germany and | was there during Crystal Night.
And, as my wife used that English saying, the penny finally dropped. He finally figured it out, and |
was no longer bothered by him.
>> Peter Black: Gerry, I'd like to throw this open to questions, with the mention that after the war you
worked for the US State Department, had a whole career with them. | wanted them to know that. |
would like to open the floor for questions that you might have of Gerry.

| think there are folks with microphones on either side, so those of you who have questions,
wait for the microphones so that everybody can hear the question. Thank you.

>> Thank you, Gerry. You're delightful. | have a question about your father. Why was he taken to
concentration camp, and why was he released? Was that unusual to be released once someone was
imprisoned in a concentration camp?
>> Peter Black: Gerry, didn't pick up the question. I'm going to repeat it. Why was your father sent to
a concentration camp? More importantly, why was he released shortly after?
>> Gerald Schwab: He was sent to a concentration camp because he was Jewish. Simple. Very
simple. They got everybody they could get their hands on, men between the ages of 16, 17 up to
about 60.

He was released, most of these people were released within about 8 to 10 weeks. Places like
Dachau were not extermination camps. Dachau was a concentration camp that the initial inhabitants
were workers, leaders, communists, etc., but by 1938 they were Jews had entry as well.

The fact that he was a front camp, that he was a frontline soldier, got him out somewhat
earlier. But | would say -- a number of people, obviously, died, some of them by suicide, running into
the electric fences, but at that point it was not an extermination camp, it was a place for, as the
Germans called it, preventive --
>> Peter Black: Protective custody.
>> Gerald Schwab: Protective custody. Don't ask me who they protected.
>> Peter Black: The basic purpose for the release, the purpose for the round-up was to provide some
"incentive" for Jews to leave the country, leaving their assets behind, and people were released on
the promise that they would get out as soon as possible, and that they would identify their assets, so
that the Germans could seize them.

Any more questions? Yes, sir?
>> Thanks for such a rich story, history. | was wondering if you could comment on the document that
you're showing up on the screen before, and the implications and motivations behind it, hash out this
document. The award to your father for his serving.
>> Peter Black: He's interested in hearing you talk further about the document that we put up, and
what its significance was for your father's decisionmaking process in the 1930s about getting out of
Germany.
>> Gerald Schwab: Well, it was actually the award came not from personally from Hitler, although he
signed off on it, but the president, who at that point was Hindenberg, who was a German field
marshal during World War I, who was a rather revered individual. It was a way of showing the
country's appreciation for people who had fought for the war for Germany. | would say it was a --
well, a PR routine.
>> Peter Black: What influence -- | think this was the core of the question: What influence did getting
that certificate have on your father's decision making?
>> Gerald Schwab: | think that particular document eventually resulted in the murder of a lot of
people. People who would otherwise have left earlier stayed longer. This thing is going to pass; it's
not going to be all that dangerous; we can afford to wait. In one of the publications of the Holocaust
Museum they have a copy of that. It naturally caused people, certainly, to feel that there was a
special privilege in having been a frontline soldier during the war of 1914.
>> Peter Black: Any other questions? Yes, sir?
>> With the movie "The Nuremberg Trial" was that quite accurate, or did they leave things out?

>> Gerald Schwab: Well, it was a fictionalized one, but yeah. It was an interesting, very interesting
experience. Because you saw a great deal -- first of all, you saw a great deal of the German
leadership, the top people, and | would say it's a fictionalized story.
>> Peter Black: For the audience, the film that the guest referred to was the 1962 film "Justice at
Nuremberg." The trial of the top justice ministry officials did happen. The names were historical
names. Of course, Burt Lancaster was not one of the Nuremberg prosecutors. This was Hollywood,
and it was sped up for the Hollywood purposes, but the general history is pretty accurate.
>> Gerald Schwab: Since you referred to the Justice Department, | was -- after the Nuremberg, the
first trial, subsequently there were about 9, 10 --
>> Peter Black: 12?
>> Gerald Schwab: 12 other trials, and one of them that was scheduled was the justice trial, and the
main defendant of that was to be a man by the name of Tirac, and | transferred for 6, 8 months to
Berlin where all of the documents were located to prepared documentation for the subsequent trial.
We worked very hard at it, except that we found out two months after the fact that Mr. Tirac
had committed suicide. It was a complete waste.
>> Peter Black: Time for one more question. | think this young man down here had his hand up.
>> So your exact job when you were an interpreter, were you -- was it written German or spoken

>> Gerald Schwab: The trial took place in the large courtroom. In addition, which is mainly forgotten,
in addition to the 22, 23 defendants, there were also seven organizations which were on trial. Now,
seven organizations, all with a large number of members. Everybody wanted to be heard. The idea
was that if you were a member of the SS or a member of the Reich's cabinet, two of the
organizations, that being convicted or if there were found to be criminal organizations, they should --
that would make life a lot easier for the authorities, the postwar authorities. And since there was so
much information coming in, it was decided to have a separate hearing, or separate hearing for these
organizations. For these organizations, they either submitted affidavits by the thousands, or had
witnesses.

For instance, general's staff was one of the organizations, and just about every member of the
German general staff was a witness, either for or against the organization being declared guilty of one
of the four indictments.
>> Peter Black: You interpreted for those --
>> Gerald Schwab: And | interpreted for those organizations, for those hearings. We had four
commissioners, usually one sitting. The chief commissioner was a man by the name of -- what was
his name? It was a Brit, British colonel, 31 years of age.
>> Peter Black: Harry Nee.
>> Gerald Schwab: Harry Nee, who subsequently went back to England, became first secretary or
whatever it is on the -- for the northern island. One day leaving parliament, his car blew up. That was
the end of Harry Nee. Wonderful guy.
>> Peter Black: Thank you folks very much for coming.
