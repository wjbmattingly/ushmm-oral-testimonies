UNAUTHENTICATED
Interview with Majlech (Meilech) Kisielnicki (Kisienicki)
July 1, 1992
Bayside, New Jersey
Abstract
Michael Kishel was born Majlech (Mailech, Meilech) Kisielnicki (Kishlenitski, Kishelnitski,
Kisleinicki, Kisienicki) in Kaluszyn (Kalushin), Poland, to a family with a brother and sister.
They were in the grocery business with a restaurant and gas station. His parents had many
siblings, and only one aunt survived. The family was Orthodox but not as strict as the older
relatives who were Hasids. The family spoke Yiddish at home and Polish with visitors. His
father acted quickly for the few problems they had with anti-Semitism. The only prohibition was
, against higher education. He was close to his great-grandparents who had a bakery. Kishel

completed elementary school at age 14 and attended trade school in Warsaw for six months.
Then he worked in the family business and saw his friends in the evening, including a girl friend.
In the summer he attended camp with other teenagers. His grandmother ran a newspaper kiosk.
Some of the family emigrated to Argentina, France, and Israel (were Zionists). He went to the
Russian border for a short time and soon after he returned, the Germans occupied the town.
They ordered a Judenrat be formed, and Kishel’s father was one of the 10 men chosen.
Wherever Jews lived was an open ghetto. They learned that Warsaw was worse, so they got
permission to bring some of their former residents back to Kaluszyn. Kishel was on the sanitary
committee to prevent typhus, but he caught it once. He and his brother got a passport to live on
the Aryan side of Warsaw. Soon they moved in with their cousins in the ghetto and were caught
up with a deportation on a cattle car to Treblinka. They succeeded in jumping out of the train
and returning to their cousins. When the Germans came, they hid in a basement bunker that
exited into the sewers. Soon the Germans gassed the bunker, and they were deported to
Majdanek. Kishel went into the hospital when he got sick and recuperated; and soon was
deported to Auschwitz where he remained for two years, until the war ended. He was beaten
numerous times, was transferred to various subcamps, including the coal mines, and finally on
January 18, 1945 was evacuated. He was on the road until May 8" when he was liberated and
returned to Kaluszyn. He shows pictures of his relatives and indicates a Yizkor book was written
of Kaluszyn. He came to the United States in 1948, and around January 9, 1949 he married a
Polish woman who emigrated to Costa Rica. They have two daughters and reside in Queens. He
was in the export business with his brother until they retired in 1988. He believes that his father
helped him survive.
Michael Kishel: My name is Michael Kishel. I was born Kisielnicki. At my bris I was

given the name of Mejlech. I lived in Kaluszyn, Poland, which is 56

kilometers east of Warsaw, on the way to Brest Litovsk (Brest, Brest

Litowsk) (6). The first years when I was a young boy I was attending
Cheder, and later I was attending Beta Safer, which was a Hebrew school
only to learn Hebrew and public school to the seventh grade. My family
consisted of parents, my father, Mojsze (Moishe, Moshe, Majsze); my
mother, Raizel; my brother, Abram and my sister, Chaie (Chai) Sura. We
had lived very well, and in the late 1920’s or early 1930’s my father had a
business of retail and wholesale groceries. In the early 30’s my father got
to make a gasoline station, as the town that we lived in was a main road
from Warsaw to the east, which was very heavy in traffic. He also made a
restaurant that was open 24 hours a day, practically 365 days a year. Of
course we only had closed on major holidays. Saturdays we closed the
front, but things were done in the back. We also had a business in
wholesale kosher products, such as petroleum, nafta, coal, rice, sugar, salt,
and many products that had to be brought in from Warsaw to sell to the
local grocery stores. We were well off in many ways. (23-25) no voice.
My father was born also in Kaluszyn, and I believe it was in 1895, and my
mother born in 1904 in Kaluszyn. They were young people when they got
married. My mother was 17 or 18 years old.

Interviewer: Could you tell me a little bit about your people, your parents’ family. Did
your father have a lot of siblings?

Michael Kishel: My father’s family consisted of, there were two brothers and two sisters.
One sister immigrated to Argentina in the 20’s, and another sister
immigrated to France, also in the 20’s; and he also had a brother who also
lived in Poland. And my father’s brother had a family, consisted of him
and his wife, and they had 9 children; and they all perished. My mother
had, there were four sisters and two brothers. One sister lives now in
Israel, that she is the only one that remains. One sister died in Russia after
she run away from the Germans in 1939; and one sister and my mother
died in the Holocaust in September 1942, when they were taken to
Treblinka.

Interviewer: What did your father’s father do? Was he also in business?

Michael Kishel: I don’t remember what my father’s father did, cause he died in the 20’s,
and I don’t recall exactly what he was doing. I believe he was dealing in
produce they brought in from Kaluszyn to Warsaw during market days,

| and from there he brought back merchandise for stores that ordered certain
merchandise.

Interviewer: So he was kind of a wholesaler?

Michael Kishel: Sometimes it would be called like a supplier of things, whatever someone
needed. My mother’s father, I was told, used to work for someone that
lived in the forest, like the princes or very rich gentiles, and they used to
sell their woods and he used to be, I suppose, their accountant, or
something like that, in that respect. My grandfather died at an early age.

Interviewer: What kind of education did your parents have?

Michael Kishel: My mother had an education; she was attending during the First World
War in the Russian schools and of course Jewish education. My father
only had a Jewish education.

Interviewer: Do you know what age he was when he went to school?

Michael Kishel: No, this I don’t know. I do not know when my father left school or my
mother. But I do know that they could go along with knowledge of many,
many different things.

Interviewer: What languages did you speak in the household?

Michael Kishel: In the household, we spoke mainly Yiddish. Occasionally when there are
people, gentiles, that came to visit us, we spoke Polish.

Interviewer: Did your parents ever discuss the circumstances of their meeting?

Michael Kishel: I believe my parents did not discuss with us the circumstances of their
meeting, but we know that my mother wanted to marry my father because

| he was very industrious, although the family of my mother was more
prominent than my father’s.

Interviewer: You think they just met through friends?

Michael Kishel: No, they did not meet by friends, they were about the same age, although
it was a difference of about five years, but when it comes to marry, this 1s
the ages that you marry, between four to six, seven years apart.

Interviewer: And did you always live in the same house as a child?

Michael Kishel: As a child I remember until 1929 or 30, we lived in an apartment, which
was a one-bedroom apartment; and we were three children, which was a
little too tight in today’s standards. But in those years, the more the
merrier. There was no such thing as there is no space; you cannot sleep
here or sleep there. There was no such thing. And if somebody came to
visit, there was always a place to find for them. And later on when we had
business in the late 20’s, there was a house that my father rented in the

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
beginning, which later on we bought. Was on a lot that you consider here
, like 75’ by 200” in the length, or maybe 60’ wide and about 200” long.
And there was the house that we lived, and the house had a store, and the
back of the store we had the living quarters. We also had an attic which a
tenant lived there before, and then because we needed the apartment we
paid them to move out and we occupied that apartment also. Because of
the space that we needed more, my family rented an apartment which we
| used only for a bedroom, and about two houses away, which it was only
about 10 steps away. The back of the lot was a warehouse. Of course, all
the things that was necessary for the business, and there was—sometimes
there was a lot of space we used to plant fruits, like onions or potatoes or
strawberries or whatever my mother or the people that worked for us liked
| to do for us; because we always had people helping us out in many, many
ways.
Interviewer: Non-Jewish people?
Michael Kishel: That’s right. I don’t want to mention it over there.
Interviewer: So, you remember growing up in this environment?
Michael Kishel: Yes.
Interviewer: What kind of a street or neighborhood was it?
: Michael Kishel: Well, it was — the neighborhood, our town was a town of a population of
| about 10,000, and we had about 75, 80 percent Jewish. Maybe not exactly
75, but it was about 65 percent Jewish. And that I remember for many,
many years. The town lived from mainly from different trades. There
were a lot of people that had a trade making prayer shawls, Tallisim.
There were also a lot of people that made sheepskin coats. There were a
few people that dealt in skin-making leather, like tannery. And, of course,
shoemakers and tailors were abundant. And the majority of it, the rest,
were mostly, I would say about 30 percent of the people who did have
businesses, businesses of textile, like selling materials for suits. There was
no such thing as ready-made suits here. There were tailors that made
ready-made suits, but they were making them for out-of-town, for business
people in Warsaw or other ones. But if you wanted to have a suit, you
went to the store to buy three yards or three meters of material, and give it
to a tailor who made it for you. I remember that we always had two suits a
year, for Passover and for High Holidays. After that year, the following
year, my mother gave the suits away to relatives who were less fortunate,
and if they were still good in the same condition, they wore it that way,

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
and if not, they turned it over on the other side, the material, and remade it
, , so it looked like new. The same thing was with shoes and other things.

Interviewer: How would you describe the relation between the Jewish families and the
non-Jewish? Were they Catholic?

Michael Kishel: The Gentiles in our town were 99 percent Catholics. The relations
between the Gentiles and the Jews, officially were supposedly good. We
particularly had no problem, because all the Gentiles that used to come
around had respect for my father. And especially the precinct, the police,
were practically stationed in our house because it was a station that the
trucks and buses that used to pass by our town made a stopover, taking
gas, filling with gas, and all the passengers came into our restaurant to eat,
and for this it was very lively in our area. And the town was—every
evening young people used to stroll along the street, especially the main
street, it was called Warsaw Street, or Warszawa (Warszawska) (132,
Polish name of street). And especially when it came Friday night and
Saturday night, you could not pass a certain area without bumping into
one another because they were walking four or five in the width. And old
friends and young people and everybody was very happy. Of course, there
were occasionally were anti-Semitic slogans, not to buy from Jews,
because this came from other places that instigated against Jews and, of
course, it dropped off among other populations or areas, and the same
thing dropped off on Jews in our area.

Interviewer: So there were local fascists, youths?

Michael Kishel: Yes, there were fascists, but officially they did not come up to say exactly
what they are. But in a group they were barking. But many times the
Gentiles had very much respect for my family, for my father, and there
was no hesitation that if someone came into our house and said something
against the Jews, that my father could take him by his neck and throw him
out with a kick in the back, in the rear end, and it was o.k.

Interviewer: And, as the decade of the 30’s progressed, did things get tougher?

Michael Kishel: Well, it started to get a little tougher after Hitler came to power, and it was
a lot of writings about how he was treating the Jews. And, of course, there
was a Polish anti-Semitic party, it was called, NDEC (?), the National
Polish Party. I don’t remember exactly what they are called, but there
were a few of them. And they had their newspapers, and they used to
write many articles about how bad the Jews are; and what the Jews did bad
to Poland, and what they do to this and what they do to that. And, of

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
course, many Poles did not have anything, or did not have any incentives
to go out and work and better themselves; only saw that the Jews take
everything away and the Jews have everything. And this made anti-
Semitism a little more.

Interviewer: So there were more incidents?

Michael Kishel: Actually, there were no incidents. The only incident that was once was in
the county, I don’t remember exactly if there was someone that killed
someone in the county, or if it was at a time when a German ambassador
or counselor was killed in Paris. That person that killed him was from
Minsk-Mazowiecki (165 — name of town). I don’t remember exactly if
this was the case, but there was some incident in Minsk-Mazowiecki and,
of course, did not do much good. But people still lived, and there was no
other choice to do but you had to live with them, to make the best you can.

Interviewer: But your freedom of movement or opportunity was restricted?

Michael Kishel: No. Freedom of movement was not restricted, and of course, there was
restriction on higher education in schools. There was no higher education
in our town. Our town was only public school up to the seventh grade.

Interviewer: Tell me again what your schooling was?

Michael Kishel: My schooling was that when I was a boy, let’s say 4 or 5 years old, the

| first thing he would attend was a Cheder. I remember during my time of
Jewish education I went to four different rabbis; from the one that started
with small children and bigger children and so on and do forth. And then
when I was about 11 or 12 years old I was attending a school which taught
only Hebrew, because my father was a Zionist, and he wanted us to know
Hebrew. So we went, and that day, 11, 12 and 13, I was going to that
Hebrew school in the morning, let’s say from 9:00 to 12:00; from 1:00 to
6:00 I went to public school; and from 7:00 to 8:00 or 7:00 to 9:00, a rabbi
came to the house to finish my religious education. So for a time we were
busy educating ourselves.

Interviewer: And you were Bar Mitzvah when you were 13?

Michael Kishel: - And I was Bar Mitzvah when I was 13.

, Interviewer: What was the ceremony like?
Michael Kishel: Well, the Bar Mitzvah ceremony was new to me, when I came to the
United States. There was no such thing as elaborate Bar Mitzvahs that

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
they have here that was there. There was only at a time when I was Bar
Mitzvah came on a Saturday, I was given an Aliyah and I was reading
from the Torah—I don’t remember exactly what I read, the part that I was
supposed to, but after that there was a big Kiddush in the synagogue and a
lot of friends came to the house and we had a separate party in the house.

Interviewer: But were you, -----? little kid put on a pedestal?

Michael Kishel: We just went to a Bar Mitzvah. (c.195)

Interviewer: Yes. We'll get back to the Bar Mitzvah. You were going to talk about

| your great-grandmother, Miriam (Mayim) Gelbarg (196-name?) (?)
Michael Kishel: The picture you see here is my great-grandmother. Her name was Miriam
_ Gelbarg (Gelbog (?)). She was a baker woman and the whole town knew

her. She also made boxes for Tefillin. She died in 1934 at the age over
100. I was told a story here in the States when I came in 1947, through
her son, that her son run away from Kaluszyn as a young boy, maybe 16
or 17 years old. He came to America; his name was Wallis (?) Gilbert and
he told... When he contacted after the war to some Kaluszyn landsmans, |
was told by some landsmans that went away before First World War or
right after the First World War that when her son run away to the United
States, run away from home, she did not know where he is, and she almost
forgot him. When one time came a picture from him and without a hat on
his head, was standing in front of the oven in the bakery, she saw the
picture and threw it into the oven.

Interviewer: And you remember her?

Michael Kishel: I remember her being sick, laying in bed in the early 30’s. These two
pictures are of my grandmother who is the daughter of my great-
grandmother and my grandfather. These pictures were taken, I believe, in

the 1930’s. Her name was Rifka Rzondzinski (?). She perished during the
Holocaust in 1942. My grandfather’s name was Fischel Rzondzinski (’)
and he died before World War II, sometime around *32or ’33.

Interviewer: And your grandmother, Rifka Rzondzinski, lived in Kaluszyn?

Michael Kishel: Lived in Kaluszyn until the--. My grandmother originally lived with my
aunt in Minsk-Mazowiecki (230-city(?)). Since 1939, after Kaluszyn was
burned out, lived with her daughter and her son-in-law in Minsk-

Mazowiecki. In 1942, after they start to liquidate the town of Minsk-
| Mazowiecki, my aunt and my grandmother came to live with us in

http://collections.ushmm.org

Kaluszyn, and my grandmother perished in the Holocaust in 1942 on the
way to Treblinka or in Treblinka.

Interviewer: They were living with you for awhile? Was she born in Minsk?

Michael Kishel: No, she was born in Kaluszyn, as far as I know. Yes, they were born in
Kaluszyn.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. Do you know anything about her background? How many
brothers and sisters she had?

Michael Kishel Yes. On my grandmother’s side there were three sisters. One sister died a
long time ago, that I did not know, that lived in Kaluszyn who tended the
bakery together with my great-grandmother. Her husband, Moishe Aron
Siroka (?) who lived until 1939, I’m sorry, until 1939 when the city was
destroyed, with his wife and also had a bakery. After the city was
destroyed, he went away and went out of town, but I do not know what
happened to him.

Interviewer: He was born in Kaluszyn also? You don’t know. Do you have any idea
how old he was in 1939?

Michael Kishel: This great-uncle of mine, Moishe Aron Siroka must have been in 1939
maybe 65, 70 years old.

Interviewer: And he and his wife, they ran a bakery; and so your great-uncle, Moishe

, Aron Siroka owned a bakery, or he ran a bakery?

Michael Kishel: He ran a bakery with my great-grandmother was still alive, but later on he
run a bakery also. His wife died earlier, but I don’t remember her; but he
remarried, and he ran the bakery.

Interviewer: How many children did they have? |

Michael Kishel: They had four children, three sons and one daughter. One son died during
the Holocaust in 1942. One son went to Israel in the 1930’s. One son
went to Russia in 1939, as you will see with a family picture, as well as
the daughter.

Interviewer: So these would be your second cousins?

Michael Kishel: My second cousins. They would be my second cousins.

Interviewer: So your Uncle Moishe Aron, did you know him when you were a kid?

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: Yes, I knew him very well because we had a restaurant, and we needed
cakes. He was the baker that made cakes.

Interviewer: Did he have people employed in his shop?

Michael Kishel: The employees in the shop was only he, his wife, and his daughter and a
son: because the other son went away to Israel, and one son had a shop in
Warsaw with my aunt in partnership. They were making knitted goods.
They were knitting and making garments for—they were contractors.

Interviewer: So your great-uncle, Moishe Aron, do you remember—what was he like?

Michael Kishel: He was a man like you see today. I could see it today. You go in an area

where a lot of Jews lived, you can see the same type of man that he was
then; you can see it today also.

Interviewer: He was very pious....

Michael Kishel: If you look at a picture, you can visualize in going, let’s say if you knew
New York, Borough Park or Williamsburg, or the east side, you can see
Jews like this, just like him.

Interviewer: Was he—do you remember him as being nice to you or---?

Michael Kishel: Well, he had no reason not to be nice to me. We were not the type of
young boys that went out and making mischief to all the people. We had,
as you call in Yiddish, “der cheretz” (c.300) (?). We had—we honored the
older people. We had respect for them.

Interviewer: So, do you know, he probably had Yiddish schooling and--?

Michael Kishel: Oh, yes. He was very well-versed in. ...

Interviewer: He’s not Hasidim, is he?

Michael Kishel: Yes, he was a Hasid.

Interviewer: He was?

Michael Kishel: Yeah. But he was a Hasid with his brother-in-law, my grandfather, I don’t
know. But my grandfather was a Hasid—used to call “keren vitz
Hasidim” (ph) (c.307). Used to be like say we have a gerech (ph) (c.309)
Hasid. You have different—from different towns—rabbis. People go to
him for holidays; they go to him for benedictions; they go to him for very
important questions. My grandfather was a Hasid of a rabbi that called
“keren vitzachoosit” (ph) (c.312). You need spelling, PU....

Interviewer: So it was a very religious family? The whole extended family—but
your...

Michael Kishel: Yes. My mother’s side was very religious, but my mother herself was not
that way because she was already another generation and more modern.
Although she knew all the rights and wrongs of religion, in the house we
practiced religion. There was no such thing as a non-kosher home. In
Europe, there was no such thing. You could not visualize even the people
that did not have much, to go out and buy for the house, non-kosher meat.
Younger people of my age at that time—13, 14, 16, to be—considered to
be a wise guy, he went into a Polish delicatessen and bought himself a
piece of kielbasa, and said he had it. Like he conquered, who knows what.

Interviewer: Did you ever do that?

Michael Kishel: I did that too; but I didn’t eat it. I just had to be someone with a group,
although my group did not go there because it’s required, maybe it was
cheaper than Jewish salami. Although I had it in our house, this salami
which was better quality because it was more expensive but to me, it
would cost me nothing. But it was a big thing to go in with a group and to
participate.

Interviewer: So in your household, you celebrated all the holidays?

Michael Kishel: All the holidays; in our household everything was 100% kosher, we
celebrated all the holidays. Although the—as I mentioned before,
business—we did conduct business. The main thing the restaurant was not
open on a Friday night or till Saturday; but we did sell gasoline because
we had employees, that was a whole night. They were gentiles, and they
were selling the gas and brought the money in.

Interviewer: So there were a lot of vehicles at this time? You know, running on gas? |
always get the picture of these ;

Michael Kishel: Pardon me?

Interviewer: There were a lot vehicles running on gas?

Michael Kishel: Oh, yes. If you ask about vehicles—this was a main road. Same thing
like you have New York to Boston or New York to Washington. There
was a main road, traffic of trucks and buses that were going with
passengers to Warsaw.

Interviewer: But there would be a lot of horse and wagon (c.348)?

| , http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: Oh yes, there were horse and wagons too, but we had nothing to with
horses since we had the gasoline station.

Interviewer: Did your family have a car or truck?

Michael Kishel: We had a truck for business. You ask me if my family had a car. |
remember in 1937 or ’36, there was an old beaten up Ford, and it was
called the Model T Ford. Because we had two trucks, and we had
chauffeurs, so we were depending upon them to fix it, to run it. My
brother bought the Model T Ford and was fixing it. It did run, but looked
like... Idon’t remember what happened to it because my father did not
allow because it was too—taken away from things that he supposed to do
otherwise. Maybe it wasn’t good enough or something. But we had two
trucks that were—I don’t remember exactly whether there was two—or
maybe because two, there was different models at a later time. I
remember the first truck we had was a 1926, then was a 1933 or a 1936
Chevrolet truck.

Interviewer: So if we could just finish the story of your—I know we’re skipping
around—of your great-uncle. Did he live also with your great-
grandmother?

Michael Kishel: No. My great-grandmother lived with her daughter, Miriam; at a time .
when I knew her. Before maybe she lived with her daughter, his--.

Interviewer: Where did your great-uncle live?

Michael Kishel: In his house, in his place. He had the bakery, the bakery was downstairs
and upstairs, they lived.

Interviewer: Okay. With four children?

Michael Kishel: With four children.

Interviewer: And his wife, what was his wife’s name?

Michael Kishel: I don’t remember his wife or his wife’s name because she died before |
even knew her.

Interviewer: But then he remarried?

Michael Kishel: He remarried. He married a very nice lady who worked with him
continuously till... |

Interviewer: And were the four children all by the first wife?

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
_ Michael Kishel: The four children were all from the first wife.

Interviewer: They didn’t have any other children?

Michael Kishel: No.

Interviewer: So, did you ever get together with this great-uncle for family occasions?

Michael Kishel: The family occasions we’re together is not with the uncle, was already the
younger children, because the uncle was the age of my grandmother. The
age where we got together was my mother with her sisters and brothers
and their children. So the older generation was not included in the
gathering unless the grandmother came—the same thing like you have
here. You invite the parents, or you invite the children of the parents, or
you invite the cousins, or the cousins not excluded.

Interviewer: Right.

, Michael Kishel: It was something like that but not to that extent as it’s here.

Interviewer: You started to talk about your bar mitzvah and the family party. How
many members of the family---?

Michael Kishel: There was no family party. The only bar mitzvah that I had was a Kiddish
in shul. There were a lot of people that were more friendly with—more
friends of my father that invited them to our house to have another drink
and another fish or another. Because usually, in the shul, you give a party,
you give whiskey, cake like sponge cake, and herring. You invite them
into the house, you give them fish, or you give them challah, you give
them some other things. You give them beer. This was the party in the
house. But no family things, there was no such things as gifts here, as a
check---

Interviewer: was it?

Michael Kishel: I don’t remember that I got it. But I probably did. Maybe I got another
tallisguten (ph) (c.405). You know a small towel, you know what
tallisguten is? It’s a small towel that you wear on maybe I got it—but I
stopped wearing it when I was maybe 10, 11 years old.

Interviewer: You were 13 when you were bar mitzvahed, weren’t you?

Michael Kishel: Yes, but you see that tallisguten you wear when you are a child. Many
times you see the young kids, they run around, the fringes still outside and
they are running.

| Interviewer: And so just about the same time, you left school?

Michael Kishel: The school—when I left school I was about 14.

Interviewer: And that was the end of elementary school?

Michael Kishel: That was the end of elementary.

! Interviewer: And then you went to___?

Michael Kishel: I went, yes, after I finished the elementary school, I went to Warsaw to
attend a trade school which was run by the Jewish community by a Jewish
crebovska (ph) (*c,417), It was a street where the Jewish... I attended that
school for about six months, and I lived with a family that were very

, religious. It was not too much to my liking, and I was a little bit of
homesick.

Interviewer: That was 1934?

Michael Kishel: That was 1934.

Interviewer: What do you mean by they were too religious? What did they expect of
you?

Michael Kishel: What I mean by too religious, that I had to sleep with a yamulka on my
head. I had to pray every morning. The people that I lived with were

| distant relatives of my mother. He was a barber that worked in the house
only for those people that cannot go take shaves. Only very religious
people came to take haircuts; special haircuts that you cannot use a razor
or... It was such a thing that was very special. I was too restricted, and
this gave me a little bit—made me a little bit lonely. I came back to
Kaluszyn, to the house, and from there I worked in our business because
we needed me. My main work was, we had the shifts, daytime and
nighttime. Most of the time I worked nighttime, because in the evening
we used to go out with friends. I say till about 11 o’clock or 10 o’clock
and after that I came home, and I attended the business at night till about
5, 6 o’clock in the morning.

Interviewer: You mean you worked in the restaurant, the gas station?

Michael Kishel: In the gas—pumping gas, in the restaurant.

Interviewer: What sort of things did you do with your friends in the early years?
Movies--?

Michael Kishel: We used to go to—movies we only went Friday night, Saturday night, or
, Sunday. Or we used to go out in summertime, in daytime we used to go

out bike ridings, and evenings we used to go out just walk around the
street, strolling and telling stories, just like you have fun here; but not such
a degree that many time you see here. The public school also supplied one
school was open evenings so that children, students, could come in and
congregate there. We used to play various games, domino or checkers.
We used to develop, I don’t know if you ever heard of, literary cards.
Like you take a -if you have in a deck four cards of each four kings, four
queens, four jacks, four aces and so on. We used to make those cards, by
literary cards we mean, known literary people; like poets or musicians. As
a matter of fact, I wrote down here, writers---

Interviewer: Composers?

Michael Kishel: Composers, musicians, writers. Different type of very known people,
politicians. We used to play cards just like you pull a card from
someone—if you have four kings, four composers, you go out. First you
go out with the cards, then you win. We also played like blackjack and
other types of games with cards. This was our times we---.

Interviewer: Did you start dating in your teens?

Michael Kishel: We had a group of friends dating, but we did not go directly with each
other. We were always going in a group; two friends, two boys and two
girls, or three boys and three girls. I have some pictures of those friends.
These are my first two girlfriends. This is my first one; this is my second
one. I did not bring my third one out. I forgot to take the picture which
the third one was during the war from 1940 to 1942. But my fourth and
last one...

Interviewer: This looks like a very modern girl, wearing pants.

Michael Kishel: My ultimate and last one is this one; my two daughters (?)(c.495)

Interviewer: Wait a minute. This, your wife? |

| Michael Kishel: This is my wife.

Interviewer: She’s not in this picture?

Michael Kishel: No.

Interviewer: You met your wifein____—?

Michael Kishel: I met my wife in New York. She is not—my wife is not a Holocaust
survivor. This picture was taken in 1936, ’37, on vacation in Mrozy.
Mrozy was a railroad station. We used to go out there for vacations. It’s
five kilometers from Kaluszyn.

Interviewer: That’s M-r-o-z-y.

Michael Kishel: That’s right. On my right is Idzia Pignabish (ph) (c. 504), that’s her; to
my left, Marsha (Masza) Tennenbaum (?) (c.505). Both died in Treblinka
from Kaluszyn on December 9. Idzia Pignabish (c. 508) had a sister
whose name was Lolly—tLala, we used to call her. We called her Lala,
this is why we called her because she was a doll. She looked like a doll.
The family had a store of—liquor—a liquor store. She was my friend for
many, many years.

Interviewer: Did she go to the same school as you?

Michael Kishel: We went to the same school, the same public schools.

Interviewer: And she left when she was fourteen also?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: What did the girl students do when they left school?

Michael Kishel: The girls didn’t do much. Some girls that their family were not well-off,
while needed, some girls went to work as a seamstress, to learn a trade.
But these girls were well off, the people were well off, so they did not
send them.... As I can remember, maybe, because I did visit her when she
was in Warsaw, maybe she attended a school in Warsaw, I don’t
remember exactly. I don’t remember exactly because I did see her in
Warsaw a few times, where she was.

Interviewer: Maybe you could talk about this being together in 1936, °37, in Mrozy.

Michael Kishel: In Mrozy, yeah.

Interviewer: Because I could write about that, what were----?

Michael Kishel: During summertime, we used to go for vacation to a town called Mrozy,
which is a railroad station five kilometers from our town. Our parents sent
us there because they had a friend that was running a vacation house for
children of our groups. We were there for about six weeks; four to six
weeks.

Interviewer: Was it on water or___?

Michael Kishel: No—water was about a mile away, and it was mainly in the woods. A
house and we used to get up in the morning and used to play ball and go
on hikes. Although there wasn’t much to do, but we enjoyed it because it
was in the air. We had fresh air, and no one had to tell us what we can do
and not do because the people that wanted us to be there, treated us very
well.

Interviewer: How many years did you go there?

Michael Kishel: I believe I went there two years, two consecutive years. I went there, and
my sister went also there. There was no need for me to go home during
this time as the parents want to see us. They used to come to see us, how
we’re progressing; because to them children on vacation was mainly that
they should eat more. Because we had everything in the house, we had to
get paid to eat. So they sent us away to a place where we can get to stay
with friends and eat together and be there.

Interviewer: I don’t understand that. What do you mean eat more? So you ate very
good food at this 2

Michael Kishel: So being you are in fresh air, you get more appetite to eat.

Interviewer: Isee. And the food was good?

Michael Kishel: © The food was, good food mostly butter and cream cheese and sweet
cream and fishes and herrings and all kinds of things what we like;

| because nobody knew about cholesterol then. We had eggs practically
every day.

Interviewer: So how many of you teenagers would be together there?

Michael Kishel: We were there about 18 to 20 teenagers.

Interviewer: Did you sing songs together at night?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we would sing songs, yes. Here, I'll show you two pictures, again.
One picture is Aldra (?), myself, with friends. We all attended the same
school. The one that stays with me, her name is Sarah Aronson (?). She
was married—she married after the war with a man by the name of
Cooper. He died in France. She lives now in Nancy, France.

Interviewer: You still stay in touch with her?

Michael Kishel: Yes, I’m staying in touch with her by telephone. She visited us a few
times. I saw her a few times in her house.

Interviewer: So where were you rowing to?

Michael Kishel: This was all in Mrozy. That was all done vacation time.

Interviewer: There was a pond there?

, Michael Kishel: Yes. The person that sits at the end of the boat, he is the son of the woman
that was running the house, the vacation house. This is Idzia Pignabish (?)
(*,669). The person in the middle, the two in the middle, one’s name iS

| Adam Kamyeni (ph) (c.671). His name is—now he lives in Israel, and his

name now is Sella (?) (c.671). The girl next to him is a girl that came to
visit my sister, she’s from Warsaw. She died, I don’t know where she is
now. So she came to stay with us one summer, and she went for a
vacation.

Interviewer: You look quite old here, all of you, to be doing camp things. You look
like you’re in your—well you were, you were 17 or 18 years old. So that
was ;

Michael Kishel: Yeah.

Interviewer: That was really a luxury for kids that age not to work in

Michael Kishel: That’s right. This is a picture of the—this is the mother of my friend that
you see in the picture with the two girls. And the other one here; the one
below her is her daughter, her younger daughter. The one next to her is
the daughter of the woman that runs the summer house, which is a sister.
Next to her is my sister, and the couple above are the parents of the boy at
the left, of this boy. This picture was also taken in that summer house,
summer camp. It‘s getting complicated. |

Interviewer: Yes. So you had a very—it was a nice break from your regular routine. |
But you don’t remember what these two girls did when they went back to
town after that summer camp? How young, were either of them married
before the war?

Michael Kishel: No, no. Marsha Tannenbaum (?) had relatives that originally came from
a town called Kobryn (Kobrin, Kubrin) (ph) (c.691). Kobryn, that’s about
50 kilometers east or northeast of Brest Litovsk (ph) (c.692). That would
be about 200 kilometers from our town. She had relatives there and her
parents were, not druggists; in New York or in Kaluszyn there were not

such a—were a drugstore, but there was also a store that used to sell
ready-made prescriptions. Like you could get pills for—against headache,
like aspirins. Or special soaps, like you have a drugstore today but
without the drugs. But her father could have made drugs, but he was not
allowed to; maybe because he was Jewish, or because maybe he didn’t
have the license to be a druggist, but he was there.

Interviewer: Did he own the store?

Michael Kishel: He owned that store.

Interviewer: And he lived (c.701)?

Michael Kishel: They lived there; they lived there, in Kaluszyn for a time, all that.

Interviewer: You don’t know if she was born in Kaluszyn?

Michael Kishel: She was born in Kaluszyn, yes. But she had an older sister and a brother. I
don’t know where they were born, in Kaluszyn or they were born in the
other town.

Interviewer: She had an older sister and an older brother? And she was the youngest?

Michael Kishel: Yes, she was the youngest.

Interviewer: Okay. And she had the same schooling as you. The school you went to
was for boys and girls?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we went all together.

Interviewer: So it wasn’t—there were Hasidic schools were segregated weren't
they?

Michael Kishel: No. This was a school, a public school.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. But there were a lot of Jewish students?

Michael Kishel: Yes. As a matter of fact, the public school—we had two public schools.
One public school that only Jewish students attended, only Jews, although
it was a public school. The only school that non-Jews attended with the
Gentiles were those that had very heavy accents and to make—to
straighten out the accent—to teach them better the Polish language, those
had to go to a Polish public school. But we went, all of us, everything was
conducted in Polish only. The public school although the attendance was
all Jewish, but the schooling was only in Polish.

Interviewer: Oh. Was Marsha a good student?

Michael Kishel: Yes. |

Interviewer: Were you a good student?

Michael Kishel: We were all good students.

, Interviewer: But there was never any idea that any of you would go on to some

secondary school in another city?

Michael Kishel: She went back to a school from where her parents came. How many years
she went there, I don’t remember.

Interviewer: The name of the town again is ?

Michael Kishel: K-u-b-r-i-n.

Interviewer: Okay and her parents were from that town?

Michael Kishel: Her parents were from that town. They settled in Kaluszyn; since I knew
them, they were living in Kaluszyn.

Interviewer: Before she was born?

Michael Kishel: I don’t know. I only know her because we went to school together.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. You’ve told me a little bit about__—?

Michael Kishel: Idzia.

Interviewer: Idzia. Her father was the one who owned the liquor store and she had
sisters and brothers?

Michael Kishel: She had this one sister.

Interviewer: She just had one younger sister, adorable—Lala.

Michael Kishel: The word, lala, is a doll. The word, lala, in Yiddish is a doll. Her name
was different but we didn’t call her anything else but Lala.

Interviewer: Is Idzia—is there anything special about her that you remember?

Michael Kishel: We were very good friends, all of us; with Marsha and with Idzia. As I
said, she was my first girlfriend. How did she became my first girlfriend
is also a story. And the story goes back as follows: After each school
year, the school made trips to towns in Poland; historic towns, like
Warsaw, Krakow (Cracow, Krakau, Krako, Krakoy, Krakuv, Kroke) and
Kazimierz, which was a king in Kazimierz which was very good to Jews,
and then Tooteenia (ph) (c.738) which is on the north, on a port. And

| supposedly on the way back, we went by train, on the way back was
sitting on the benches. I was sitting supposedly next to her, and she was
next to me, and we were sleeping. All having our heads this way, that
way. Supposedly my head touched hers, and her head touched mine; and
it came to know that a maid that used to work for us a certain time,
worked later on for her parents. She used to come to us and go there—
used to bring—tell stories. Whether the stories were true, that she likes
me; and she came to tell me, and J said I like her too. This was the story.
But besides her, was a very nice girl, and there was no reason not to like |
her. At the time we did not think—we were 13, 14 year old children. We
would not think to go out tomorrow to get married, but we were very good
friends.

Interviewer: Then you said that this was also a girlfriend?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: But just a girlfriend: __(c.750)?

Michael Kishel: As a girlfriend, we can say more than a girlfriend.

Interviewer: Oh. You’re very close. Well, tell me something—a little bit more about
her. She went to the same school?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we all went—was only one public school. One public school was
one large building that had—in that school we had from the fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh grade. All of the grades were located in different parts
of the town. There were a building that had the first and second grade,
and the second and third grade, different areas. But that school was a
large school with a large yard that we used to come there, and that was the
main school.

Interviewer: What did she do? Do you know what she did after she left school? Did
she help in the liquor store--?

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: No, she wouldn’t help in the liquor store but, most of the girls didn’t do
much.

Interviewer: What did they do? I mean I’m really---.

Michael Kishel: There was not much to do.

Interviewer: Did they babysit with the little kids, little sisters?

Michael Kishel: There was no-no. Maybe sisters—babysit for her sister but---.

Interviewer: Did she weave, embroider?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we were—maybe. As I mentioned before, I believe that she went to
Warsaw to a school because I met her a few times in Warsaw, because |
used to travel to Warsaw occasionally because I had nothing to do also. I
wanted to take a trip to Warsaw.

Interviewer: But—so 18, 19, 20’s, you didn’t have any specific work to do?

Michael Kishel: No. Twenties was already the war—during the wartime, 1939.

Interviewer: Oh, okay so that changed ,

Michael Kishel: That changed. There was not much—in small town was not much to do.

Interviewer: Oh, okay. So between the ages of----. But most of these girls would
generally marry pretty young back then.

Michael Kishel: No, I would say that there was no such thing as marrying young; married
in their twenties. There was no—twenty, twenty-one—there was very few
that would marry younger. Very few and there were no accidents—had to
marry.

Interviewer: There weren’t?

Michael Kishel: No, I wouldn’t say so. There were more respect for girls than it is—We
never thought—all right—let’s say we used to be in love with girls—kiss
and hug and touch. But to go to extremes, I say it for myself, that I
wouldn’t take chance because you never know what can happen. No one
wanted to----

Interviewer: So nice Jewish boys wouldn’t---?

Michael Kishel: Do that. That’s right.

Interviewer: Even though you were very good-looking.

; Michael Kishel: Thank you. Wait until you see another picture.

Interviewer: All right. So to return to your grandmother---.

Michael Kishel: I remember that after my grandfather died--- Rifka Rzondzinski.

Interviewer: R-z-o-n-d-z-1-n-s-k-1 who was your---?

Michael Kishel: Grandmother. My mother’s mother. My maternal grandmother. After my
grandfather died---

Interviewer: In the early thirties?

Michael Kishel: In the early thirties. My grandmother got herself a kiosk to sell
newspapers, and I remember that there was a time that came—an area that
made a train to go to the train; like a small train, a feeder. Because before
and even during that time and later on, used to be special porters, special
guys that used to have a horse and buggy, horse and special, what you call
it? Nota van, it’s a—used to be a horse and carriage; used to take
passengers from our town to Mrozy to go to Warsaw which is west or to
go to Siedlce (c.798) which is east, or to other places wherever they need
to go. Then it became the city, made a train. A small train with a huff'n
puff locomotive with one caboose, with one to carry passengers to the
train. My grandmother had there a kiosk to sell candy and newpapers and
sodas and whatever there was. When the newspapers used to come in
from Warsaw, came by train to Mrozy; and from Mrozy they used to bring
in with that train to Kaluszyn, and she used to sell it. Later on the train
stopped going because the city was losing. The owner of this was losing
money, and a man that used to be the conductor of the train bought
himself a horse; and he was riding with the horse on the rails with that
train to Mrozy. But it did not do good enough because he didn’t have
enough money to feed the horse; so he stopped going. So that kiosk was
transferred to another part of town, and she had that kiosk in the town.
Then we had to bring in the newspapers from Mrozy to Kaluszyn with the
regular drivers, with the regular carriage, horse and carriage that was
running. But because there was competition, there was another man that
had a kiosk; we as grandchildren, my brother or I, or my grandmother’s

. son used to go with a bicycle to Mrozy and get the newspaper, a pack of
newspapers, Jewish newspapers and Polish newspapers and load it up on
the back of the bicycle and bring it faster. Who brings faster the
newspapers is able to sell it to those who are interested to read. Because
not everybody wants to buy a paper. There was—if one bought a paper,
he used to give it to all his neighbors to read it. Or two of them bought the

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
| paper—you buy today, I'll buy tomorrow because a paper used to cost 15
| or 20 Russian-naught (ph) (c.824) maybe more, I don’t remember exactly.
But it was an amount of money that no one wanted to spend day after day
after day. So from this she was having—making a living.

Interviewer: How old was she then? I don’t think you told me her approximate birth
date?

Michael Kishel: I would say that when she died, she must have been in the seventies.

Interviewer: Okay, your grandmother was born about--?

Michael Kishel: Around 1875.

Interviewer: In Kaluszyn?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, let’s say in Kaluszyn. Yes, I believe because they all came from
Kaluszyn.

Interviewer: They went back for generations?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: So she had the kiosk and after your grandfather died around—did you say
around 1933?

Michael Kishel: Yes, in the early °30’s.

Interviewer: Her husband was a Hasid?

Michael Kishel: Yes. Was a Hasid, yes. But he did not live from the Hasidic. He lived—
he had a job like going to the places of woods, the forest. He used to—
when they used to sell the trees to make the wood, he used to give
assessment. I really don’t know what he was doing but I do know that he
was connected with the forest kind of business.

Interviewer: All right. So, and your grandmother was just at home then with the
children?

Michael Kishel: Yes. Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. And she only started working outside the home after her husband
died?

Michael Kishel: This is what I know.

Interviewer: Okay. Well, that’s very difficult, a woman her age to start going--.

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: But there was not much; to run a kiosk is just to stay there and take—and
help out. But because her daughter helped out; because her daughter
remained with the kiosk later on.

Interviewer: The daughter---.

Michael Kishel: The daughter, the oldest daughter.

Interviewer: What was the oldest daughter’s name again?

Michael Kishel: Hannah. I did not put the name on.

Interviewer: Hannah. H-a-n-n-a-h?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: She helped her mother with the kiosk?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: So her mother wouldn’t have to stand up, outside ? Cold and
stuff , (c.850).

Michael Kishel: Was colder than that. She helped out, and her family helped out; and they
remained with the newspaper business, with the kiosk.

Interviewer: So she did that after 1933, and kept it going?

Michael Kishel: Kept it going until 1939.

Interviewer: Did she only speak—she spoke Yiddish?

Michael Kishel: Yiddish, yeah. My grandma she understood, I believe she spoke Russian,
too. But not to me, because I did not understand Russian. And Polish—
we did not talk to our parents, to our grandparents in Polish. We talked to
our grandparents only in Yiddish.

Interviewer: Do you know what your great-great-grandfather did? Could you tell me-?

Michael Kishel: No, about my great-grandfather, I know nothing about.

Interviewer: Do you know how your grandparents met, by any chance?

Michael Kishel: No, I do not. Those days there was no such thing as meet. My
grandparents was only a made-up marriage because you did not go... They
were more religious in that they would not be—not to say that they

. : wouldn’t be interested—but their parents would not allow for them to go
oe out and see each other, and then say we want to get married.
Interviewer: Right, so it was arranged?
| Michael Kishel: Was arranged marriages.

Interviewer: Were they happy?

, Michael Kishel: Evidently. If you see Fiddler on the Roof; he said it, do you love me,
what’s today is love? His parents told him, they’ll get to like each other.

Interviewer: Do you remember anything about her house? Where she lived?

Michael Kishel: What I remember only when---that they lived in a house where my great-
grandmother was with her. In a house, she was in a bed. I always
remember my great-grandmother laying in a bed, she was sick.
Occasionally she was out, but the few times that I went in to see my
grandmother, she was there. I saw her there. But there was not—what
can [ tell you?

Interviewer: Did she live near you?

Michael Kishel: No, there was not far away, maybe 100 yards.

Interviewer: Oh, oh. Did a lot of the family members live in the same area?

Michael Kishel: Yes, most of the family lived in the same—unless they moved out. Which
family members you talking about? It’s only my grandparents and my
aunt; this aunt that she lived in Kaluszyn. The other ones did not live
there. For instance—

Interviewer: Well you talked about your great-grandmother and your great-uncle?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, all right, they lived 100 yards further. But this is already considered

, their second generation or third generation of me.

Interviewer: Right. Okay, just trying to get things in order. All right, before 1939,
some of your family members emigrated to Israel?

Michael Kishel: Before 1939, my mother’s sister--.

Interviewer: Whose name was__?

Michael Kishel: Whose name is Nahama Houseman (ph) (c.895); left for Israel with her
husband, Meyer Houseman (?).

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Interviewer: They were Zionists?

Michael Kishel: Before I do that, Il say differently. Before the war, let’s say about in the
thirties, maybe ’34 or °35, my mother’s sister Nahama had a partnership
with a cousin whose name was Fishel Soroka (ph) (c.899) in Warsaw
where they made knit goods. They knitted goods and cut into articles like
sweaters and jumpsuits for children. Later on my mother’s sister married
and went to Israel. Another sister—

Interviewer: Were they Zionists?

Michael Kishel: Yes.

Interviewer: There were—so a lot of your__?

Michael Kishel: Practically all of the family was Zionists, Zionist oriented.

Interviewer: How was the decision made? How did certain people decide to leave then
for Israel? Was it a matter of—because I understand there were only a
few places...

Michael Kishel: They decided because—first of all they decided to leave because they
were idealists. They wanted to go to Israel. Of course, they also had to
have a certificate. With the certificate is a permit from the British
government that they can get into the country. So that’s what they did.
When they got the permit, it was just like today somebody gets a visa from
a country that it’s out of some place and tries to get here which is the most
important thing.

Interviewer: But was there any idea of escaping something that might happen’?

Michael Kishel: At that time there was no thought about escaping. The only reason people
went to Israel was because they were Zionists. They wanted to help build
the country. |

Interviewer: About what year did she leave?

Michael Kishel: It was in the early thirties.

Interviewer: You mentioned some other family members who emigrated to South
America?

Michael Kishel: The other families that emigrated to South America was my father’s sister,
to Argentina.

Interviewer: That was much earlier?

. http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: That was in the late twenties. Maybe not late twenties, maybe middle
twenties. Another sister went to France, also about the same time.

Interviewer: Just to make better lives for themselves?

Michael Kishel: That’s right. They married people that were making for themselves a
better life for their husbands; to make a better life in those countries. One
was making wooden articles from—like for toys and for furniture. That
one was for Argentina and the one that emigrated to France was a tailor.
He had a very important tailor shop in Paris.

Interviewer: You kept in contact with your cousins?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, we kept—I remember the addresses from the cousins, from the
relatives in Argentina and in France because when they were writing
letters in there, I used to read the addresses or address the letters, the
envelopes to them. So when I came back after the war, I remembered the
address in France of my uncle and to see whether they are alive. After the
war somebody was traveling there, and I gave him the address, he should
look up and see whether that address exists and whether they are there.
He did bring me notice that a son was alive of that uncle of mine, which is
my cousin. We were in touch with them since.

Interviewer: Were his parents killed?

Michael Kishel: Parents were killed.

Interviewer: They were deported?

Michael Kishel: They were deported in 1939, in 1941 or ’42 when the Germans started to
bring all the people to the concentration camp, into the gas chambers.

Interviewer: They were deported from Paris?

Michael Kishel: From Paris.

Interviewer: Is that--?

father’s cousins, and this picture was taken sometime in, I would say, in
the thirties or twenties.

Interviewer: Did all these cousins live in Kaluszyn?

Michael Kishel: They all lived in Kaluszyn; they all perished in the Holocaust.

Interviewer: So when——please talk about what happened after Germany invaded
Poland.

Michael Kishel: After Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, we were under the
belief, as we were told by the Polish government, that the war will not take
long; that the German armaments are made out of wood and cardboard
things, and things will fall apart, and they will not last long. But soon
afterwards, maybe two or three days in the war, a plane passed by, and we
all thought that this is a friendly plane because it came in so low. What it
did, it just threw down a little bomb in our town; as there was a line in
front of a bakery to buy bread, and a lot of people got killed. After this
had happened, we realized that all the propaganda that we were taught
about before is not as true as it seems to be. Being that we had trucks and
some other people and friends of our family had trucks, we decided that
we’ ll take two trucks and go away to the east, towards the Russia. In the
meantime things will slow down and stabilize itself. The reason why we
went away is because the older people knew from the First World War
that when Germans come in, the first thing they do is they take the men;
the young men and the older men to work, and they tell them to work on
the roads and—forced labor to work for them. Being that Hitler came to
power, the fright was a little bit more than before. So everyone said for
the young people to move away.

Interviewer: But in 1938, after Kristallnacht in Germany, nothing happened at that
time?

Michael Kishel: After 1938, we were only frightened but we did not think that this thing
would come up. Because when Hitler went to war with Poland, was only
that he wanted to have the corridor to go through to Danzig, to take away
that right and so on. But nobody knew that this is going to come so far.
Later on, everything—his propaganda was that the Poles want to attack
him, and so on. But when the war came, all was towards how to escape
from Hitler that they’re coming in. Because their radio and the news came
in that the Germans have entered Poland, and they are pushing in certain
areas into the country more and more. So my father and his friends took

. http://collections.ushmm.org

two trucks, and we went away about 20 people. We took some food with
us towards the Russian border.
Interviewer: Your whole immediate family?
Michael Kishel: No, only my father, my brother and I and friends of ours and friends of

other people—their families. My mother and sister, at that time, my

mother and sister and my grandmother, my father’s mother, was living
with us as her husband passed away some eight, ten years before--. They
remained because nothing was taught that they will do anything to the
women. So they remained. After we went back about 200 kilometers
from our town, we heard that a town has already been taken, but we did
not realize at what cost. We waited later on to go further and further
away. We were up to the Russian border, about 3 kilometers from the
Russian border. The name of the town was Mzorich (ph) (c.018). It’s a
town pastRo___—,___—S—s(c.019) and so on. Then on September 17, the
Russians came in. The Russians came in from the other side, started to
take occupied Russian area. At the same time, also came news that the
pact that the Russians made with the Germans was that the Russians will
go up to the Vistula (Wisla), and the Germans will go up to the Vistula;
and that will be the dividing line. Being that we were on the east side of
the Vistula, we presumed, which is logically, that we will belong to the
Russians. So while the Russians were pushing forward, we were behind
the Russians going with our trucks; going home to see our parents, to see
our mother and sister and the family. When we came to a town, 33
kilometers from Kaluszyn, which town’s name is Siedlce, we were told
that the Russians are not going to occupy until the Vistula. They’re going
back to the Bug (ph) (c.035), which is another demarcation line. At that
time we heard the news that the town of Kaluszyn was bombed out—all—
everything. Was a big fight there because there were many groups of
soldiers were there congregating, put up a big fight against the Germans,
so the only thing the Germans could take revenge was to burn down the
whole town. Our house was on the outskirts of the city. Actually we were
coming from Warsaw to our town; we were the first or the second house
entering the city. So the outskirts of the towns were remains; our house
remained standing. Being that we were in Siedlce, we heard the bad news
about it; we decided that no matter what, we will go back to see our
mother and sister and the other relatives and see what happened. When
we came, we saw the very bad situation with the town burned out and
were told how the fight happened; that they took all the Jews and other
people into the church, and were closing the doors; I supposed they

wanted to kill all the people. Well, anyhow, we came in, we started to
realize that many people were living in our house, because they did not
have any place else to live. So we see more strangers than our own. So
we start to negotiate with the people that were there, to either to go to their
relatives to live there, as we had our relatives to take into our house; or to
some people to give money to go to other towns, because they did not
have anything. Slowly, it took about maybe a week, maybe ten days, |
don’t remember exactly, that the people vacated our house. We took in
our relatives to stay with us at the time. Then the town was without any
- government. The Germans weren’t in; the Russians did not come in, and
the Poles did not know what to do. But there were militia, the civil—
Interviewer: Wait, the Germans did not occupy the town?
Michael Kishel: The Germans, being that the Russian was supposed to go to-—after the
Vistula, the Germans moved out. The Russians did not go in, were very
| close, did not go in, so the Russians didn’t come in there. So the town was
by itself. But there was civilian employees of the town hall, the town
government, they patrolled; the city should remain and see what happened.
A few days after we returned, the Germans start to come in. They started
to come in, and they told the mayor of the city, which was a neighbor of
ours, to order the Jews to get a—to make a Judenrat, to make a Jewish
government to attend to the Jewish things. But what they had in mind was
not so much as to attend to the Jewish problems, as to supply them with
whatever they want. Their appetite became bigger and bigger. They
wanted for the Jews to supply them with furniture for their occupation,
that they’re going to be there. Being that they did not have a place in the
town because the town was burned out, they moved into a town, five
kilometers from our town, which is Mrozy. They settled there, and the
Jewish Judenrat (c.097), the Jewish community, had to supply with all the
furniture, tables and chairs and beds and everything there. They also
ordered the mayor of the town which his names was Pliwaczewsk1
(Plywaczewsky) (ph) (c.101) to nominate ten Jews, ten rich Jews, that they
should be responsible for anything they will want to. Among the ten Jews
was my father also. I wrote a separate article in Yiddish about the
function of the Judenrat. This article I wrote in request of some Jews that
came back from Russia and settled in Israel. That being that we were very
few from our town that remained alive, he wrote to me, and I responded to
him. I wrote an article in Yiddish, sent to them to Israel, to publish it.
They took out a lot of items that needed and put it in the book, of a Yiskor

' http://collections.ushmm.org

book, a commemoration book for our town. Maybe they have it. Evo (’)
has it. It’s in Yiddish. I brought it with me here.
Interviewer: All right. We’ll deposit that in our archives.___(c. 124).
Michael Kishel: To be exactly—what happened how it went through, through the time the
Jews lived in the German occupation until 1942 is mostly described in this
article. Being that my father was in Judenrat and doing all the things what
the Germans wanted—
Interviewer: What specifically did he do---?
Michael Kishel: Specifically, his main object was to make the laws, or their requests, or
| their orders smaller; which he many times succeeded, most of the time
succeeded. For instance, although the town was living mainly in the
center of the town before the war, when the town was burnt, all the Jews—
there were older people that lived on the outskirts of the town. When the
ghetto was made, the Germans ordered that all the Jews should go into the
center, they should have more of them. What my father did is to make the
Jews live the way they are in the outskirts of the town. Wherever they
were before, make it like that. When they closed the ghetto, because the
ghetto was an open ghetto—that means you could go in you could go out
—when they closed the ghetto, it also remained the way it was. Jews had
no right to go out of town. Most of the Jews that lived there, that
remained there, made their livelihood from the villages; from the farmers
that lived on the outskirts. They used to go out and sell them a shirt, buy
from them the cheese or the eggs or anything. This was their business.
This is how they—their livelihood. The orders were not to go, because
they will be shot. Of course, there were many instances that some were
shot going to the railroad. My father succeeded in getting many permits
for those people to go out during the daytime. There were many things,
for instance, for the community itself. There were ...
(Tape 2)
There were many orders that the Germans came in requesting that they
want to have for their families—rings and earrings and dresses and things
. like that. The first thing they did is they came in to ask, because we were
the first house, almost in town. My father was the person that used to deal
with them. They came in and gave always orders. They need this, and
they need that. If not, they will do this, and they will do that as
punishment. Most of the time, he succeeded in all this to come down with
the orders that they wanted, and sometimes it happened that they couldn't

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
do it either. They killed a family of two children and a friend of one of
them—a very bad situation. But most of the time, although it was very
painful, it did succeed a lot of them.

Interviewer: There was no wired ghetto then?

Michael Kishel: No.

Interviewer: Just a designated area ?

Michael Kishel: Was a designated—the ghetto was wherever the Jew lived. In Kaluszyn
was the ghetto.

Interviewer: It was not closed in?

Michael Kishel: There was no closed in like you have—you had in Warsaw ghetto with a
gate—closed around. There was no closed in. But the closing of the
ghetto meant that they cannot go beyond the area where they lived—they
can only go in the town. They are not allowed to go to the village, not
allowed to go out of the city without a permit. There was also succeeded,
my father succeeded is to bring back food from the county. Because the
gendarmes, the police, the German police used to confiscate from the
farmers—they used to bring to take food to sell in Warsaw and other
places. When they passed by, they did not allow to do it, they used to
confiscate it. They used to give out to the churches and to different areas.

, So my father used to go there and ask them to give some of them to the
town where they made a kitchen to feed the poor people and children. My
mother was attending this kitchen for a long time to see that the supplies
are enough.

Interviewer: But your father’s business was totally disrupted, or did he continue to
pump gas?

Michael Kishel: There was no—the business was disrupted in 1939 because there was no
gas. Jews could not have no gas business, and the trucks were not
available; and we did not have any supplies. The only thing is what we
had was a store that we could still have like the restaurant going for us
part-time and some groceries to sell. But most of the time my father was

| busy, because they made my father busy with the Judenrat business.

Interviewer: What did you do?

Michael Kishel: I was also getting---. They also requested that the Judenrat gets Jewish
police and Jewish sanitation people, people that help out to keep clean the

http://collections.ushmm.org

houses because--. On top of that our town was destroyed in 1939. They
send in a transport of Jews from two other towns that the Germans
annexed to Germany. It was a town called Pabianice (c.37) and Kalisz
(c.37). A few hundred people from each of those towns were brought into
Kaluszyn, and they were settled there; said this is where they have to live.
They had to be given a place to live into other families and some to live—
to repair in the buildings that were destroyed. Many of them couldn't do
, it, and they felt that to go away someplace else better or their relatives
lived and that remained. Then to be able to keep the apartments or the
houses clean, there was no facilities to bathe. There was only one mikvah
and to have these people—they did not have much—and to ask these
people to have clean, where to take them preferably by inducing them with
bread or with other things they should go and take it. Because they were
afraid that going to the mikvah or something, being that it is an order from
the Germans, will be something wrong. Being that everything was closed,
the city became infected with typhus. I was one of the men going to the
sanitary committee. About a dozen friends and non-friends, other people
that were designated to go out to those houses to see that the people keep
clean. There were times that we used to take a brush and clean up. There
were SO many—you could see on the floors so many lice working like
bugs, was terrible. Slowly, we had to induce the people to come, to get
clean. Every day of the week, we had other groups of people to take into
the mikvah so they can go in there and take baths and get clean. In the
meantime some people left over, while they were in the baths, to cleanout
the houses. They come on back clean.

Interviewer: What were the non-Jewish ?

Michael Kishel: The non-Jewish population, they did not do anything. They were
staying—they still lived there because many of them, they were older-got
burned out. But they had the right o go anywhere they wanted. They
were not restricted. It was only the Jews that were restricted. That went
on and on. Then came the German companies.

Interviewer: What was your sister doing?

Michael Kishel: My sister wasn’t doing anything. Occasionally, they used —yes
occasionally my sister helped out to induce people to go because they
needed to have people to direct them. Where to go because some of them
were children without families. Some of them were older people and they
needed help.

Interviewer: So all of you were involved in some way inthe effort __?
Michael Kishel: Yes, in the effort, yes. This went on to—in many ways...In the beginning
of 1940, 1939, °40.
Interviewer: And your grandmother and your grand-uncle, they were old.
Michael Kishel: I don’t know what happened to my grand-uncle during the war. [don't
know what happened to him. Whether he died—I don’t remember him—
what happened during the war. But my grandmother went to live—
because they were burned out—went to live with my uncle’s family, with
my uncle. My mother’s sister, my mother’s brother-in-law, my mother’s
sister’s husband had relatives in Minsk-Mazowiecki (c.85). Minsk-
Mazowiecki was not destroyed. So he went to live in that town, and he
| took along my grandmother. My aunt, with her husband, took along my
grandmother. She lived there until 1942 or even before, 1941. Because
my aunt did not have an apartment large enough, so they sent in my
grandmother to live with us. My grandmother, my mother’s mother lived
with us. My father’s mother also lived with us during that time and she
died of heart failure; my father’s mother, in 1940 or °41. |
Interviewer: But did people have enough to eat? Did your family have enough to eat?
Michael Kishel: Well, we had—there was always not enough to eat, but you could always
get for money to buy. It was very expensive, but we managed. There was
a lot of—of course there were—there was a flour mill nearby. They used
to mill four—we used to get it. Food was a problem. It was expensive.

: The thing is a lot of people did not have the money. They did not have
much to do in the work. Coming back now to work—there came in a time
that the Germans came in to take people to work. What they needed was
to clean up the roads because the army used to pass by and the road was
full of snow. They could not pass by, and they grabbed Jews to clean.
Later on, they had to repair the roads and came in a civilian company; a

: German civilian company by the name of Wolper and Goebel (Volpher
and Gable) (?) (c.103). They used to grab Jews to come to work for them
without anything. They used to come in as Germans. Although they wore
civilian clothes, but he was a German, he had the power. Nobody could
go fight against him. They used to go for days, grab every day some other
people to come to work—take them away four or five kilometers from the
house—from the town, and they used to work on the roads. Break stones
and work on the road and do different things. Later on, being that this has
happened, my father used to — we go to the Germans for many things that

http://collections.ushmm.org

they wanted, so he said you’re always coming to bring me this and bring
me that. Why don’t you see that the company that takes the Jews to work
that they should pay? So he was calling the German civilian company,
told them they have to pay for the work that they ... Although before, no
people wanted to go to work because they got beaten up, and they didn’t
get paid. After it was an arrangement that they are to pay, a lot of people
wanted to go to work, but it still was not enough payment what they
wanted to pay. Because at that time, they paid five zlotys a day, which a
kilo bread which is about 2 % pounds, cost ten. So all they could make is
a half a kilo bread; so how could they go to work? So being that the
Judenrat wanted to have the people work and do in something, so the
Judenrat supplied with the bread. With each worker that goes to work,
will get a half kilo bread. The money what he will get for the day’s work,
he will have for other things. There was also some other supplies that
used to bring in from Sec (c.124), merchandise, the potatoes, onions
or salad or some vegetables; used to bring in for the kitchen. Many times
used to be extra potatoes, used to give to the poor people to...and this 1s
how they lived. Was very hard but...

Interviewer: There were a lot of deaths?

Michael Kishel: Yeah.

Interviewer: And there was a lot of typhus?

Michael Kishel: That’s right. As a matter fact, typhus, as a matter of fact I got sick with
typhus, too.

Interviewer: And there wasn’t any medicine?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, the only thing we got was strychnine. There was injections. My
brother also got sick, typhus.

Interviewer: That was in 1940?

Michael Kishel: That was in 1940

Interviewer: And you were really sick?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, I was sick; I had a lot of fever. The typhus is, it’s not water typhus;
it’s louse typhus that you get very high fever.

Interviewer: And was there any question that you wouldn’t live?

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: Well, a lot of people died. And there was also—they built a hospital—
they established a hospital. There was only one doctor, and there was one
nurse. She was actually, before the war, she was like a midwife. When
the hospital was established she was supposedly running it. The only
thing the hospital to do is to at least take out the patients from the house,

that they should not infect the others and attend to that. But later on, other
patients from that family also came. A lot of them died, which there was
no medicine to support, and some of them came out.

Interviewer: So how long were you sick___?

Michael Kishel: I was sick about—I would say about three or four weeks.

Interviewer: And you and your brother were the only ones who got it in your family?

Michael Kishel: Yes, my brother and I were the only ones who got it. We stayed in our
house because we tried to keep the house clean, that it should not get—all
get infected. This is how we got out of it. But a lot of people got out from
the hospital; it’s the luck, it’s the attention and everything. More
explanations is in the story that I wrote in Yiddish. Different sections of
different times what the Judenrat had to do, and how they did it, and who
was responsible, where and how and so on. How many people were
working in what work was there. If it would work out on the pages, would
be if you have someone that reads Yiddish...if you'll make the copies, so
if there’s any question, you’ ll tell me which page it is, then you call on the
phone and Ill talk to the person exactly what it is. Then when it came in
1942, when they started to send the Jews to the gas chambers and
supposedly to work in the east—first they started at Warsaw. Then we get
closer and closer—they came to Minsk, and they came to Kaluszyn.

Interviewer: You had news of what was happening in Warsaw (c.161)?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we had news. As a matter of fact, we had news because there was a
time that we could get a permit from the German authorities to allow us to
bring in the family from Warsaw. There was also many German
Wehrmacht, soldiers, that were drivers that were there. That was in 1941,
41 or 42. They were working on the—to dismantling the synagogue. So
we used to induce him to go to Warsaw and bring out some people. So
my brother used to go out with him to Warsaw and bring out the relatives
and some other relatives of other people used to be there. Of course, we
took them out from there, but then they came into us, and they perished
through—later on. Was very hard but this is what happened.

Interviewer: Did they have to sneak out of the ghetto?

Michael Kishel: Oh, yes. Unless they come with a group that was going to work outside
the ghetto. This is what happened when I was in Warsaw.

Interviewer: Did the German army know what was going on? (c.176)

Michael Kishel: Some of them—most of them knew. Those that knew, that were working
around—let’s say they were guards around the ghetto. They knew—they
guarding the Jews not to go out. Or many Germans that were just in the
Wehrmacht, just in the army, did not know; they just knew that the Jews
are their enemies, but they didn’t tell them anything. But those that used
to take care of all these resettlements are mostly SS, and their helpers were
mostly Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, from Latvia, and
Poles. All Volksdeutsch, the Germans that used to live in Poland before,
they used to call them Volksdeutsch. That means Germans, folks of
German extraction. They were the worst because they knew exactly who
is who, and what is what, and they were the biggest obstacles.

Interviewer: So you got some of these people out and then —__(€. 189)?

Michael Kishel: Well then it came in 1942, it was in September which I already told in the
beginning. When I run away, then I run away to——I came to Warsaw

Interviewer: Can you repeat that part?

Michael Kishel: Yeah. Well, in 1942, when the Germans came, it was in Yom Kippur, 21°
of September, and told the Judenrat that they have to have people to go to
the camps. To work in camps because they need a lot of people there.
Whether they need it or not, because Germans want, a lot of Jews don’t
want to go. But some of them, a lot of them, went and they remained alive
until later on. Those that didn’t want to go, they used to—they remained
there. Four days later they came, and they had an action to take, to send
them out to Treblinka (Slobinka) (?) (c.202). At that time, [ran away
from the marketplace through giving that I took pails of water to supply
the people that were in the market. I went a few times with a friend of
mine, and later on I—at the evening, when the evening approached...

Interviewer: ___ friend of yours? (c.205)

Michael Kishel: His name was Josef Gontulsky (ph) (c.205). He was a neighbor of mine
and lived across the street. After we watched them taking away the people

: in horse and buggy to the railroad station, when the night approached, we
ran away to a camp, to a labor camp called Minya (ph) (c.210). There I

http://collections.ushmm.org ,

was for about a month, and I met my brother that was in another camp.
We got together, and we stayed there in another place working on the
roads till December 1. On December 1, the Germans released ail the labor
camps what were around the city, around Kaluszyn, and other places and
send them all into town to make a new ghetto, supposedly. But that was
only for the reason to make another settlement. Instead of taking—
sending for each one from 15 different places, they got it everybody in one
place and sent them out together. At that time, I ran away again; tried to
run away, but one of the policeman tried to cut us and was aiming at me
and at a friend of mine, went in together. He killed him. [ran back and
hid in a cellar through the night. About 3, 4 o’clock in the morning, I
walked to another—to the county town Minsk Mazowiecki (c.224) where
there still remained a place of work. I was there for a few days, and I met
another friend that came there. We bought——-made passports, Polish
passports, that we are Poles, we are Christians. He looked for a place for
us in Warsaw on the Aryan side. We lived with a woman whose husband
supposedly was in a prisoner-of-war camps with the Germans or was
killed during the war. She was a poor woman and we paid her well. We
were there since more or less December 15 to about January 10 or January
15. We heard that there are still a lot of Jews in ghetto, and that life goes
on as before and there is no, nothing much is expected. So we decided
that we’ll go into the ghetto to see what’s what. My friend had a sister
with a family living in the ghetto.

Interviewer: In the Warsaw ghetto?

Michael Kishel: In Warsaw ghetto. And while there I found out that I had cousins living in
Warsaw ghetto. So he went to the sister, and J went to the cousins. We
were only about a block away, let’s say about 200 yards from each other,
and we saw each other occasionally. This—we were only there about a
week, maybe less than a week, until January 18, 1943, when we got
caught in another deportation. The Germans surrounded again the
Warsaw ghetto and took out a lot of people to send them to Treblinka. So
my cousins and I were going to the place, the gathering place. At the
gathering place, I met my friend with his family, together. I said to them,
and they said to me, let’s stay together. Whatever we will decide to do,
we’ ll do it together. Meantime my cousins were wise guys. They did not
let themselves go that easy. They run away right away from the gathering
place. They went back and hid, and they were all right; my friend and his
family, which was a couple, a mother and father and two sons. One son
remained hiding, and just the couple and the son and I and the friend went

into the train. We were together with a plan that as soon as we move out,
we will jump the train. We made up that whoever jumps...

Interviewer: Was this a regular train with ? (c.255)

Michael Kishel: No, not a regular train. Not with seats. There was no first-class train, or
second or even third-class. It was a cattle train.

Interviewer: So this was a deportation ___? (c.257)

Michael Kishel: This was a deportation to Treblinka, not a forced labor. This was a
deportation to Treblinka. So my friend and his family and I decided that
who will jump first to go forwards to meet the other jumpers. This one
that will jump the last, to go backwards to meet the jumpers. So the first

, one jumped, the woman, my friend’s sister. She was also from Kaluszyn,
but she lived in Warsaw. His father, his name was Micholson (Michelson)
(ph) (c.265), my friend’s—his father was originally the president of the
Jewish community in Kaluszyn; his name was Micholson. In that
explanation, in that story what I have there is written about that he was
there. Anyhow, when she jumped, perfect, very good. Then jumped her
husband.

Interviewer: What was it, in a ravine or ?

Michael Kishel: Below was just a train, but on top on the roof were the Germans with

: guns. You only had to jump to realize where you’re jumping because

along the railway, there were poles of telegraph or electric poles that they

) should not hit. The second one that jumped was the husband of the
woman. The third one jumped, the son. I jumped the fourth one, and I

| started to go back. So I found the son a little injured. Then going more

forward, I found the father, more injured on his head here. And we were
waiting to go forward, the three of u, because we didn’t see the woman
coming because there was already quite a distance; so we presumed
whatever happened to her, she has to be on her own. Be with three of us.
So I said, let’s go forward, and we’ll see whether his relative, my friend
which was a brother-in-law of the father, whether he jumped.

Interviewer: The train was going (c.285)

Michael Kishel: The train was moving very fast and to me, the only thing that happened to
me is a button; a button from my overcoat, my jacket, that broke. But the
two Micholsons, the two friends, the two people from the family, one got
injured alongside on his face and the other one on his head, very heavy

injury. Well, we had no choice. I could not take them the way they are
and we went over to—I knocked on a door at a farmer’s, at a village.
There was...

Interviewer: Were a lot of people starting to jump?

Michael Kishel: Oh, yes, there was a lot of people jumping, and a lot of people got killed.

Interviewer: They were being shot at?

Michael Kishel: Shot, they got shot because there was no other way out. You got to take
your chance here while you can. |

Interviewer: You knew that you were taken to be killed?

Michael Kishel: I knew that, yes, yes.

Interviewer: How did you know that?

Michael Kishel: Because we already knew that everything goes to Treblinka. The way that
the road took because, see, I knew the area, Warsaw. The whole length of
the road, I know where it goes. The train goes east, is on the way to

: Treblinka. Treblinka was, from my Kaluszyn, was about 50, 60
kilometers.

Interviewer: And you had already heard that __ (c.300)?

| Michael Kishel: We already—at that time we already knew because when they started at
the beginning to resettle the Jews, the news was that they are settling to
the east because they need a lot of workers to help on the front because
they have attacked the Russians in 1941, and they need people to work
there. And this is what they needed people. So this was the thought, but
later on we knew because there were a lot of people that run away from
Treblinka. So being that I knew that I am going, here is my chance, to do
it now or to do it later. If I try it now, I have a chance. So I jump from the
train, and nothing happened to me. But I had to do something with my
two friends; I could not leave them. So I knocked at a door, and there was
a woman that opened up, and she let us in. She gave us some water, she
gave us some things to clean them up, that they should not be visible on
his face, on his head that something happened to him. Being that was
wintertime, took heavy clothes, had a big hat. I fixed him up good, and
then she said we have to pay her. All of us had money. The money we
had was belts, double belts, not double belts—they were belts that you
could put in money in between the belt. He had money, the son had

http://collections.ushmm.org

money, and I had money. But he told me, he cannot take out the money
yet because she’ll see it, I should pay him. So I had actually money in the
belt, and I had money in my pockets. So I took out the money and I paid
her, a few thousand zlotys, I don’t remember how much it was, but quite a
lot and quite nothing; but we were safe. We went back to the station. The
station was a station away from Warsaw, was Rembertow (Rembertov)
(c.324). The name of the station was Rembertow. I went to Rembertow...

Interviewer: How far was that?

Michael Kishel: We walked about three kilometers to the station. I went in, and I bought
three tickets back to Warsaw. My looks were like a Pole. Nobody could
recognize me that I am a Jew because I had, from pictures that you'll see,
you will see, if you know the features of Poles, you’ ll see my features. |
bought the tickets. They had a place, my friends had a place in Praga (ph)
(c.331). Warsaw was a two-town...There was one side of the Vistula
called Praga, and the other side of the Vistula called Warsaw, but together
was Warsaw. They had a place prepared so I took the train, and he went
off with his son where they supposed to. They got to the place where they
were hiding then, right when I took them back. I went further, to Warsaw,
and I had also a place that I could go in because my brother had a friend, a
Polish girl. She took him; that Polish girl’s sister got an apartment in
Warsaw, and she took my brother there. She was hiding him from them.
When I came back, I had to go some place in. I went into that place,

together with my brother. We were staying there together till a few
weeks, maybe two, three weeks. At that time, there were two ghettos in
Warsaw. There was the regular ghetto and a small ghetto. The small
ghetto was a place where many Jews, tradesmen, tailors or those used to
work in leather things, to provide the Germans for their needs, for their ,
clothing, for whatever they needed. They needed people that know how to

| sew, how to cut things. So we thought, my brother and I, that we will go
into that ghetto and see maybe we can stay there because we did not want
to antagonize the people that took us in. But being that there’s a place, in
case something will happen, we have a place to fall back. So we went in
there, but we couldn’t arrange anything, we couldn’t do anything. We
went back, and we were staying there. But being that my brother was
there, and I see that it will not be too good to stay two together. If
something will happen, let happen to one, not to two. So we look for
another place, and I went to a separate place, to another Pole. He was a
shoemaker, and I don’t remember how much money I paid him. Every
time I paid him for the week, he said oh the price went up so much; it cost

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

so much money and this and this. I have seen that shortly, Pll be out of
money, and I won’t have a place to be there. At the same time I knew that
there is a place, that the regular ghetto is still alive, still there. So I
thought Pll go into the ghetto again. When I came into the ghetto again, |
found my cousins, the same ones that we went out—that we were taken to
the umschlagplatz (c.368), to the gathering place, to go away. They
hollered at me, why didn’t you stay with me, why did you run away, what
did you want with them? I said look, he’s also Kaluszyn. Well, I started
to live with them, period. We went—occasionally we went out of the
ghetto because you could go out with a group supposedly to work, to get
the bricks here and there. I saw my brother and told him what’s going on;
that they’re still alive, and we could come in there. Being that they
were—my cousins were dealing in food. The place what they had—-where
they lived—was called Smutcha and Miller (ph) (c.379). There was

: almost a corner building. Right after the building was the wall. From one
side of the wall used to come in the workers that used to work on the
canals, in the underground, not the underground; where all the water goes
through—the sewers. They work in the sewers. They brought in, through
the sewers, they brought in to my cousins, hams and butter and breads and
everything. There was a regular business going on. It came out with a
story that in case something will happen, those Poles will lead us out to
the Aryan side, to take us away from there; which was good. But nobody
trusted them, and we built a bunker in the building we were there. The
bunker, what was called a bunker—it was closed from all the sides. We
can only have—knew one opening to get inside and was so camouflaged
that seldom anybody could find it. Of course, we did. As a fact, when
the—

Interviewer: Say that again. The bunker was made of__?

Michael Kishel: It was a basement; it was so camouflaged. To get in there that you could
not see that this wall, one touch of this wall would come out, and you'll be
able to go in. It was camouflaged. So we were there until May 8. Since..

Interviewer: May 8, 194_?

Michael Kishel: May 8, 1943. When the action started, I think on the 19", or the 18" or
the 19"", in Warsaw ghetto. I have it written some place. We were there
almost three weeks; we were there, and we couldn’t be found. Because
we always heard that the Germans are coming in through the walls,
through the places, and they are looking. Because they were knocking
places, and they couldn’t find it. Finally what they did...

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection .

Interviewer: You hid in the basement ? (c.410)

Michael Kishel: We hid under the building.

Interviewer: For three weeks?

Michael Kishel: For three weeks.

Interviewer: How many were there?

Michael Kishel: How many we were? Well, my cousins, there were three boys and two
had wives, is five. The wife had a sister, is six, and there were all those
people that live in the building. Was a dentist and his brother was eight.
The brother has a girlfriend is nine and a child. We were about 15 people.

Interviewer: {n this cellar?

Michael Kishel: In the cellar, yeah.

Interviewer: That was connected by sewer to 2

Michael Kishel: Connected, yeah. We could go out through the sewer. From there we
could go out into the sewer and go out, in and out.

Interviewer: You did that all the time?

Michael Kishel: No, we did not go in. The workers, the Poles that sold us the merchandise,
they delivered to us through the sewers.

Interviewer: Was this common in the ghetto? Were the other people getting bunkers
like this?

Michael Kishel: That’s right, that’s right.

Interviewer: The Germans didn’t know anything about it?

Michael Kishel: They knew, but they didn’t know which way to get in there. But you see,
to get into a building—in Warsaw built in such a way, that there’s an arch.
Two sides of the building, inside is an arch. When you go in the middle,
usually was like concrete in the middle; and like trucks or wagons used to
go in, used to pass by here. Then they realize, maybe they should bomb
here. So they started to throw in bombs into that concrete while getting
into the building, into the complex with gas. This gas got to us. So
instead of being caught by them, we went out through the sewer to another
place, to another bunker which that bunker was already raided. That was a
bakery; we went there, and we hid behind, my two cousins and IJ, hid in

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

that bakery behind the flours. Because the bunker was already raided, so
there was nobody there; a few people came back. My brother meantime,
wanted to—and another cousin and one of the other people that were in
the bunker, wanted to know what happened to the people across the street,
because we were living the side of the street. On the other side of the

| street was another bunker. We were connected; we could go to them, they
could come to us. So while they went to see what happened to them, my
brother got caught from the Germans, and they took him to the

| umschlagplatz (c.451). They send him away. We were waiting a whole

night or...

Interviewer: He survived?

Michael Kishel: He survived. We were waiting almost a whole night or a day. We don’t
remember whether, it was day or night, and he didn’t come back, so we
presumed what had happened. Meantime, the Germans knocked us out
from our bunker, and we went into the bakery. Later on they came into
the bakery. We had some guns with us and...

Interviewer: You did?

Michael Kishel: Yes, we did, but we were afraid to shoot because as long as you are quiet,
they did not find us. Had they find us this way, we would have been there
much longer. But we were thinking the only time we would use the gun 1s
for last resort, you or me.

Interviewer: How did the Germans try to find you?

Michael Kishel: They had—they knew that each building had people in there. The upper
floors were bombed, there was nobody there. The main floors were also
nothing there. But they knew that there’s people in there, but how did
they get there, they didn’t know.

Interviewer: So they would put tear gas?

Michael Kishel: They put tear gas in. First, they bomb it to make a hole. Then they put
tear gas in or other kinds of mustard gas or other kind of gas. As a matter
of fact, I got gassed; which I’ll come later on to tell about it. So they came
into—to get us out from the bakery bunker. We, my friends, my cousins
and I, we had two guns between us. There were three of us, we threw the |
gun away. When they took us out, they found the guns later, and they
asked whose gun is it. We said we don’t know; we just came in this

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
morning. We know nothing about the guns. They looked at us, and they
didn’t find anything.

Interviewer: What language did you speak?

Michael Kishel: German. I speak German. Yeah, everybody spoke German. I mean, you
spoke Yiddish, you spoke German. I speak German well. So they took us
into the gathering place, the umschlagplatz (c.487). I was gassed heavily
from the gas they threw in. I could not breathe too well, but my cousin,
one of my cousins, was worse. So I asked the wagon to come to the place
because he at least, while they’re pushing you and shoving you this, he
should not get killed on the way there. Maybe he’ll sit down and relax and
feel better, whatever happens later on. Before we got into the
umschlagplatz (c.496), came over a German says, why you drangen (ph)
(c.497) this dog, or something like. He took me away from him and put a
bullet in his head, finished. I remained...

Interviewer: What was his name?

Michael Kishel: His name was Manischewitz (7). I remained by myself there with two of
them: with another cousin because there were two of them, one cousin was
with my brother. Somehow, the other cousin, either he wanted to run
away, I didn’t hear from him since then. I came in on the road to
Majdanek. I could not escape any more because I felt very bad. [ could
not get into another window to crawl out to escape and then, in the
condition that I was then, I wasn’t sure that Il make it. But Pll see what
happens, where we go.

Interviewer: Where did you go?

Michael Kishel: We went to Majdanek. Majdanek is a camp near Lublin, a concentration
camp.

Interviewer: You were deported there on the train?

Michael Kishel: Deported on the train—all train to Majdanek. Overnight, well I don’t
know what time it took, but we left in the evening, and who knows how
long we were sitting in the trains until we were sent out. That was in May,
May 10. I came to Majdanek on May 10. Then in Majdanek, we had to
strip. They said, whoever has a double belt, throws it away over there;
because they knew the double belts contained money, jewelry, anything
that they wanted. So I happened to have a double belt, I threw it away. A
single belt, that means it’s only a piece of leather, like this. No danger, so

| http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

you could keep. Okay and then there were taking, go here, go there. In
Majdanek, also had gas chambers. They also had people they did not take
into the camp. They killed by various means. I was into the line to go
into the camp. I showered. They throw us—they gave us some new
clothes, camp clothing. I went into the camp. I was assigned in a certain
bunker, a certain bunk to be there, and that’s what’s there. The following
day, they took us out to work. While they were assigning us, they named
this, I got anumber 14677. My number in Majdanek was 14677. I
realized later that I’m not the 14" thousand man there. These numbers are
taken away from one died before and given new ones. So that same
number could have gone out four, five, ten times of the quantity that the
number said.

Interviewer: Did they put on you____—s(¢.552)?

Michael Kishel: No, no. Was a, not a bracelet, but a piece of metal, a piece of thing you
put on, inscribed on the uniform the number what you have. There was no
tattoo; in Majdanek there was no tattoo.

Interviewer: In the barracks, was it mostly men your age?

Michael Kishel: Mostly men my age, older ones, younger ones, mostly my age.

Interviewer: How old were the youngest ones?

Michael Kishel: The youngest? Later on came younger ones. The oldest must have been
about sixteen at that time. But because I felt very bad, I was afraid that I
would go out, they took us to work, to dig ditches, what kind of ditches it
was for I don’t know but we had to do whatever they wanted us. I felt that
one of-—I’ll go another day, another day, Pll collapse. At the end of the
workday, the kapo asked who wants to go to the hospital, who feels bad”?

I volunteered, I had no choice. Because if J am not going to hospital, Pll
be shot on the road going or coming. Lucky me—I couldn’t breathe—
lucky me, I got into a hospital, the Zindel (ph) (c.576) Hospital, and I was
there. They gave medicine; I remember, I was on a diet. They gave me
hard-boiled egg, where nobody else got a hard-boiled egg. The medicine
that they gave me because everything was on my chest. I couldn’t breathe
real heavily; I couldn’t breathe. They gave me a medicine like a liqueur, a
little sweet, and it put the phlegm down, and it helped me. By coincidence
I found a man in the hospital that was a son-in-law of somebody that I
knew in Kaluszyn. He lived in Warsaw and I asked him what happened to
your family? No. He was there and he said, here they'll treat you, it'll go

http://collections.ushmm.org

: out. Inever heard from him again, because he went probably—he went—
either he was in another, another (End of Side A, Tape 2)
Tape 2, Side B
Michael Kishel: What happened to the man, I do not know. But anyhow, I felt better, and I

went back to work in Majdanek. By coincidence, I heard that my brother
is in Majdanek but in another camp; in another part. Going to work or
from work, I met him. We greeted each other, and we say we’ll talk; we
hope that we’ll see that. We did see another time also. At that time also
happened to be transports. They were picking up people that were there to
send transports to some other places. So being that it was the end of
transport, I communicated with my brother, and he with me, that when
comes the next transport we should run to get into the transport. At least
maybe we’ ll be together, shipped out or whatever is going to be.
Something happened, that he went—when it came the next transport—-he
was taken, I was not. He was sent to a camp called Scarjisk (ph) (c.617).
There was a camp that they were place of work that they were making
ammunitions for the Germans. From there they sent him to
Chantzdehovot (ph) (c.619), to different places, to Buchenwald (c.620)
and there where he was liberated. I remained in Majdanek for about two
months until about July or mid-July...

Interviewer: work? (c.621)

Michael Kishel: Yes, we worked on the gang outside digging ditches. What the ditches
were for—many times you would think they’re digging ditches for us.
Maybe one of these days they’ ll line us up there and.... Then it came new
transports and we’re talking, got friendly with one another and said look,
what do we have here? The watery soup—at the beginning when I came
there, I couldn’t eat anything because nothing tasted good. | came out
from a place that the Poles brought out hams and cheeses and butters and
breads and all kinds; so you come into a camp, they give you watery soup,

| and I think nothing help you. So I said, let’s go in a camp; let’s go

someplace else. The little watery soup we'll get someplace else also, or
the piece of bread, or whatever it was. Well, it came, the next transport
came, and I run in there, into the next transport. They shipped me out to
Auschwitz. We came to Auschwitz, was in July, end of July or beginning
of August, I don’t remember. We came to a camp and they....

Interviewer: So it was totally your choice, the way it’s been described to me, they just
wanted a certain number of people and you Q

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: Probably. I was lucky. They kept sending me from one camp to another.
I came to Auschwitz, it was part of Auschwitz 2, Birkenau, there where
the gas chambers are. We came in, we met by kapos and by other one and
the language that I heard there, I did not hear until at that age when I was
there; such foul language, unbelievable and such murderous language.
Not by kapos, not by SS, but by kapos, by Jews, by Germans, all people
that were in the camps.

Interviewer: What date did you arrive there?

Michael Kishel: End of July or August, 1943. We were assigned in a camp which... The
camp Birkenau was just building. It was started to build maybe three, four
months before. We came in, we also had to start building. The grounds
were all full of mud, full of clay. We had to straighten out this, and the
work was not easy because everything was hard. You know, to push
wagons and rails, with a shovel, pick and shovel and carry cement up or
down in different places.

Interviewer: Were you still (c.845)?

Michael Kishel: I was still, because the fright made me strong.

Interviewer: But I mean constitutionally, you (c.845)?

Michael Kishel: Constitutionally, yes. My mind was strong because I always said,
whenever I’ve been assessed, I have to live this through. Because if
anyone in the camps, that said oh, what should I do, was beaten up. If he
would stand up, because he was beaten up by a German, by a SS man,
because he didn’t work. If he would get up by the first hit, they would not
beat him anymore. He would go up and start to do something, but if he
didn’t, he beat him more. We ask him why didn’t you do? He says what
for? I'll be killed anyhow. My philosophy was different. I said, [ have to

live it through. No matter how much of beatings I got...

Interviewer: Why did you think you had to live it through?

Michael Kishel: I wanted to see the end of Hitler. I want to see who, why is it that the
world...Later on, you closed it, and I tried to do my best to work as hard
as possible, as cooperative as possible, not to give anyone a chance,
whether it’s a German whether it’s a kapo at the work, whether it’s a
blockaelteste (c.859) which is the headman of the block, whoever it is not
to give them a chance to beat me. I could only take a chance to be beaten
when I’ve seen someplace over there lays a piece of bread. That’s have to

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
nourish me, that’s—I have to take a chance. If ll catch it, PH have it. If
I get beaten up for it, but I had a piece of bread. Those chances...

Interviewer: Did you get beaten (c.882)?

Michael Kishel: Yes, I got beaten but I had the bread.

Interviewer: How many months were you--?

Michael Kishel: I was there till May 8, till May 8 to the end of the war.

Interviewer: Oh, you were. Okay so you were there almost two years? |

Michael Kishel: Yes. Then, the workplaces—in the Birkenau, worked mostly those people
that belonged—lived in one bunk, in one place. They go out all together
with a kapo, work from this place. So he does not have to go out from
other places to look for people to work. I was working there from one or
two places, but was not steady. They transferred me from there to another
bunk. The first one was block number 24. From then they transferred to
block number 16; was a kapo, a Czech. He took us in to work in the third
camp, which was the hospital camp. See, there were four camps, four
blocks, four camps; the women’s camp, the men’s camp, the Gypsy camp,
and the krankenhaus (?), the hospital. Beyond the hospital were the
crematoriums. So I was working with the....

Interviewer: You were only Jewish (c.878)?

Michael Kishel: Yeah, all Jewish. They were occasionally some non-Jews but most of
them Jews.

Interviewer: All of you from (c.877)

Michael Kishel: No, no because there was no such thing as from. We did not have a name,
we had our numbers. In Birkenau I got a number, 129354. It was a
tattooed number. I forgot to mention that while we were still in Majdanek,
came a transport from Greece. They were very, very fast to fall. Even in
summertime, they were not used to the climate, and they were falling like
flies, very bad. We, although we had it bad, we had pity on them. That
Czech kapo...there was another kapo used to work—he was from
Krakow. We used to work at the hospital block. Because at the hospital,
they had a lot of people, although they were taking people to the
crematorium—but they were still taking people—taking the inmates to the
hospital. Why, I don’t know. First, they made them well, and then they
took them to the crematories. So we worked in the hospital block, in the

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
hospital camp, to straighten out the roads. They should be straight, should
be no mud and walkways and flowers.

Interviewer: Would this be considered an inside job?

Michael Kishel: Not an inside job, because we came in the morning and went out in the
evening back to the bunk.

Interviewer: So how far did you have to walk to___?

Michael Kishel: The walk, maybe a kilometer. Not far to walk. Later on, we were told
that they beautifying up this part, that the Germans ordered to beautify up
the hospital camp because eventually it’s going to be an international
commission come to see how they treating the people. So they show, they
will show that they have a hospital, and they have a nice place to stay and
so on. Somehow, I lost that job. I didn’t lose that job, but I lost the work
in that area. So being that I was left over, they transferred me to another
block, number four. The prisoners that were in block number 4 did not
have a steady place of block. So whenever somebody needed some
prisoners to work, he went there and got him; 10 people, 2, so it was never
steady. Today you work in one place, tomorrow they take you, another
kapo takes you someplace else. I was in that place maybe for two months,
maybe for a month or six weeks. That was the worst block, the worst that
I was there because you would never know where you're going tomorrow,
and where you’re not going tomorrow. Also at that time, was a selection.
They came in, the Germans, the SS, and took out a selection of a lot of
people to take right into the crematorium. We won an appeal, we were
outstanding, and they used to take out, this out, this in, this out.

Interviewer: The people who were sick (c.712)

Michael Kishel: They looked through who was more ill than—know who had swollen legs,
and who had injured legs and this and that. I remember like I see it like

'  today—there was one prisoner that they choose him to go to the
crematorium. He run away and hid. He hid someplace, and they couldn't
find him. They couldn’t find him, and they were held up practically a
whole day; but they could not let go because they thought who knows
what this guy is. Maybe he’s a spy, maybe he’s something that he knows.
They finally -they took the rest of them that’s selected to go to the
crematorium. They took them, and they kept down looking for him. They
' finally got him. They walked with him through the camp that everybody
should see what happens to somebody that runs away. Separately, the
witness there, while they were in camp, there were.....they brought back

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
some guys that run away. That run away from the middle of work because
they want to run away from camp. They got a beating, I don’t remember
whether they shot him or they hanged him. I don’t remember that. But
hanging was in another place.

Interviewer: Did you see (c.728)

Michael Kishel: Isaw. There were also two bunkers, two blocks that I call it bunker or
block, that we lived in. That called effektkommando (c.728) and
sonderkommando (c.728). They were all our people. The
sonderkommando worked—excuse me—the first, the effektkommando,
when the transports came to Auschwitz, to Birkenau, the effektkommando
used to look up at the—look at all the clothing, after they got undressed.
They looked at all the clothing and looked for all the hidden valuables,
rings and monies and all the things, and they have to bring it all there.
They themselves had nice uniforms because the Germans treated them
nice. Everybody wanted to go to that job, to do it, because you had a lot

| of bread, a lot of this, a lot of that, they were well-fed, and this is what
they did. The other ones were called sonderkommando. The
sonderkommando were the ones that were working to put the people in—
from the gas chambers into the fire. They were also well-fed, but they
were also very dangerous. The effektkommando, their block, and the
sonderkommando, their block, being that they had fed—they were fed
before very well, so their portions, their rations, what they were getting,
they gave it away. So it comes after we came back from work, we all
congregated in front of them because they were throwing out their bread
and their potato. You could have a piece of potato or something, __.
Separate, the sonderkommando made a revolution, then there were trying
to be with (c.744) the ones that were working for them. They realized that
they worked ___, what’s the difference, we got to do something. They
tried, some of them, they got caught, and this is what happened. | was in
that block 4 until about December 1 or December 10, something like—it
got colder. When it came a new transport; they sending away new
transports. The new transports, they used to send to the coal mines. There
were coal mines like Yavorznow (ph) (c.749), there were different; I don’t
remember the other ones. There were a few different ones. So we thought
we'll go there. As long as we’ll go away from the crematoriums; let's go
away from the crematoriums. We didn’t realize that they can bring you

| from there to here, too. They send us away to a new camp, to build a new
camp called Lagischa (Lagisha) (c.755). Camp Lagischa, they had almost
two barracks and we had to finish up all the things what was necessary to

live there, to stay there. The lageralteste (c.756), lageralteste means that
the German, that he is the head of the lager. He said you build yourself a
camp, you'll have it. That means it’s my business, I have to have a camp.
Otherwise, I cannot live without it. But we had no choice; we had to build
one. The building of the camp is the worst thing that can ever happen,
because you come in to a row of places where there is not anything there.
You got to start from scratch. There was very little food, very little bread,
very litthe—but hard labor and a lot of beatings and a lot of that. Well...

Interviewer: (c.781)

Michael Kishel: We didn’t even do the things that we didn’t do—everything. There was
no water, wintertime. We had to get ice, not ice, snow to wash yourself
because your hands were dirty from the work, the only thing we could do
was to wash with snow.

Interviewer: Where did you sleep?

Michael Kishel: They had—we had bunks. We had some places to sleep, and this is how
we did. Slowly, it bettered up the place, but it’s still coming... There was
in winter of 1943, December or beginning of January. I found when I was
in Birkenau, I found a landsman of mine, from Kaluszyn, that also came
from Majdanek; but he was in a different place, so we didn’t see each
other. But we came to Lagischa (c.772), we saw each other. We were
keeping together to see what we can do. He was an older man; he was a
man maybe 10, 15 years older than I was. Somehow he got beaten down.
They were starting to get a selection to get some people, no—sorry—-was
not a selection. He registered to go to the hospital, to the krankenhaus
(ph) (c.776). They call it krankenhaus, the infirmary, infirmary. They had
an infirmary. One thing I have to mention was that whenever I see friends
of mine, I mention it because it was frieden (ph) that I was sorry about;
for asking him. Of course, you did not have anything yours. Everything
was from the camp, you got a jacket, you got pants, you got a shurt.
Somehow, he had a sweater, and you knew it. Whenever you go from
here to there, they take away everything, even the spoon. I ask him, will
you please give me the sweater. He said to me. I’m still alive; you want
to be my heritant? You want my inheritance? I said please you know that
you'll go there; they’ll take it away from you. At least Pll have it for the
time being, and if you come back, I’ll give it back to you. He said that—l
did not take it, and for this day, I’m sorry that I mentioned it to him. For
this reason, I keep repeating that he should forgive me that I ask him that.
It did not take a week or ten days to send him to crematorium, this guy.

We remained there working, and they were building their new factories,
new buildings. The buildings we were working on with wagons and like

, on rails to supply cement and sand and different things and to work
different—to work a lot. One time as I got beaten up, I got beaten up that
from here I got a scar. Water was, no blood, everything was so thin that
water was running; could not heal. Working there for a few months, and it
came sometimes in April, May, or maybe June of 1944. It came in a new
selection, new guys from another place, taking away people from our
camp, either to send them to the crematoriums because they couldn't
work, or sending from there to coal mines. I presumed that [ will go toa
coal mine, so I was rushing to get into the line to be taken to the coal
mine. When the SS man saw me, he put me out over there. That means
he doesn’t want me. I did not want to give up. I wanted to go to coal
mine, I sneaked in again. He recognized me because he said, he took his
stick and hit me here. He says you are already here, I told you I don't
want you. He called in another SS man and said to give me a beating. 50
I got a beating from him later on. But I got lucky because the man from
the block, the head man from the place we were there, he went over to the
SS man and says, I’ll take care of him. That means he’ll give me the
beating. He was not a kapo. He’ll give me the beating, not he, which was
good because I saw, of course, many times kapos were beating up guys.
But it was still better than the SS men were beating up. So he said to the
SS man that he’ll give me the beating. Of course, he gave me the beating
because there was somebody who was squealing. [ was glad that I got it
from him. And I was there, I wasn’t taken—not to the crematorium not to
Yurvosnovy (ph) (c.822) to the coal mines. Later on came, later on came
about a month later, came another group to go for another transport. They
was sending me into Monowitz. Buna was another Auschwitz camp
called Auschwitz 3, Monowitz to Buna. When I came to Buna, | got a
vacation. For a week, I walked around, I roamed around the camp, and |
didn’t do a thing. I was just getting breakfast and dinner. In the morning |
got a piece of bread, and at night I got the soup. Nobody took me to work.
A whole group of us, because we were so undernourished that they
couldn’t do anything with us. And why did they do that to us, I don’t
know. They could have as well send us to the crematorium. There I got,
they sent me into a place where they start to take us to work. I was
working on a place they called Kandbiegvirg (ph) (c.835). They produced
synthetic carbide; know what carbide is? It’s a chemical that when it
comes together with water, it gives out gases. We were working in that
factory to make this. There was also a place that they said that they're

} http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
making there, synthetic gasoline. I don’t know how—this synthetic
gasoline or whatever this. This is what I was doing in Buna. Later on, I
lost that place, and I went to work in Rustung (?) (c.840). It’s called, they
put up pieces of—to go out to a building, alongside a building to go higher
there. You know a builder’s using it, not to put up stands...

Interviewer: Oh, scaffolds.

Michael Kishel: Scaffolds; I worked with a scaffold part. Until it came to 1945 and :
January 18. But during the time, there were some people, some prisoners
that wanted to run away. They caught them and brought them back.
Everybody had to come out and watch hanging them. There were two
men that were hanged that I had to watch. It was the most horrible thing,
the horrible thing you could ever see. And then they played the music and
they—terrible. Came January 18, we knew that the Russians are coming
closer to the camps, and we had to evacuate. They send us out in
evacuation. We walked towards an area called Gleiwitz (Gliwice) (ph)

| (c.857) different cities. We walked until we came to a place that we
couldn’t go any further. They load us up; we were in trains. There was
one time, we stopped in a train, we couldn’t go any—not left or right
because the Russians had bombed the railroad. The cars could not go
either there or here. They took us out, and we started to march.

Interviewer: How far did you walk to the train, _—__— (c. 888)?

Michael Kishel: The train—we were loaded in the train from Auschwitz. But the train
stopped in the middle, near Gleiwitz (c.888) a place, Nedeschlazen (ph), a
place there, that the train could not go any further because the rails were
broken. Then we started to walk on the roads. While walking we came
into a place called Waldenburg (ph) (c.889). Today it belongs to Poland,
called Waljick. They had no place where to put us to sleep, ‘cause we
were walking days and nights. In some places, they had the place to put
us up in a school or another place. In this place, they did not have a place.
But Waldenburg (c.873) was a mine, had a mine. I don’t know what kind
of mine, but the entrance to the mine was a big entrance what I say maybe
30 feet wide and maybe 30 feet high, and you had to walk and walk and
walk. When we walked in, they closed the doors, and we were maybe
1000 people, maybe more. From the heat, a lot of people got—heat and
hunger and everything; they collapsed. I had two friends that were with
me. Although I was very poor in—at that time we walked out of Buna, it
wasn’t that bad because we had the—the situation was bad but not as bad
as at Birkenau or in other places. They got wet—they made on themselves

and had to be cleaned up. They open up the gate in the morning; there
was a lake from the water, from the snow was a lake. I took them over
there; I cleaned them up. There were a lot of civilians that were also
evacuated and I went tothe (c.887) towards the civilians, beg
them for a piece of bread, a piece of this and a piece of that. I brought
them something to eat and myself also. We stick all together the three of
us (c.890). I was—one of the first days on the road, we were
walking in—I don’t know where we were walking towards east or towards
west, until we came to a place that was almost to the front with the
Russians. We were in stalls, in places that farmers left, and we were there.
The German army took us to the front to dig ditches.

Interviewer: Wait a minute. So you escaped from the---?

Michael Kishel: We did not escape. We could not escape. But all this time while we were
with the Germans from the camp...

Interviewer: Oh, the Germans took you to dig ditches near the front?

Michael Kishel: They took us on the road. We were always on the road.

Interviewer: How many days were you, after you left Auschwitz?

Michael Kishel: Till May 8.

Interviewer: Oh, okay, all right. So you walked---.

Michael Kishel: So all this time, we walked. Where we were tonight, we were not
tomorrow. Where every, let’s say, we found a place that we could stay
overnight, the Germans could stay with us overnight; then we stayed for a
few days.

Interviewer: How many were with you?

Michael Kishel: We were a few hundred. Always less and less because they are falling.

Interviewer: All men?

Michael Kishel: All men. Especially when we—not only that it was hard to walk in the
snow but we were walking schlasen (ph) (c.909), that is the area are a lot
of hills. We had to go up hills and down hills, and we also had to carry or
push the equipment of the Germans that walked with us. They had their
backpacks, and they put it all on the wagons, and we had to push and pull.
That was...

Interviewer: Blankets ss (c.918)

Michael Kishel: They had blankets. The Germans had blankets. We didn’t have any. We
just had a—what we had, a little jacket; the jacket to the pants what we
wore. There was no such thing as winter clothes as anything. We had
nothing. But we had to carry them. Later on, maybe there was some
blankets. No, I don’t think so. We were sleeping in our clothes, just like
that, one next to the other. Our bodily heat used to keep us. We were
pulling and pushing the wagons with their equipment, their packs with
their guns and so on. This was a type of death penalty. Each wagon, there
were no horses; we were the horses. Each wagon had about 15 or 20
prisoners. Those that were on the sides and the back were beaten up by
the Germans to push, to go faster. Those that were in the front to pull,
were beaten up why you’re running so fast, to pull back. So no matter
what, if you went to the wagon, you were a dead man. Well, I was having
two friends that were close to that; not close to that but very weak.
Carrying them, the smell and the vision that someplace over there is
something maybe you’ll find a piece of bread, was so great that you felt it.
You felt it even not—you had eyes in your back. I realized that over there
in the ditch is a piece of apple laying there. Who threw it away, I don’t
know. I left my two friends, and J ran over to get the piece of apple. The
German that was beating up all the other ones saw me running. He says to
me, oh you’re running well. Good, come to the wagon. He got me to the

, wagon, and when I came to the wagon, to a side to relieve other ones;
those that were beaten to relieve them. I was to the wagon, the guy says to
me, stay here. He put his harness, you know they put in like on a horse
because we had to...He says stay here. This is not so bad. I was there for-

Interviewer: Another 2

Michael Kishel: Another, because I released him.

Interviewer: I see.

Michael Kishel: He says, stay here, this is not so bad. Because the German that was

walking alongside him, maybe had a little heart. Maybe his heart weren’t
that bad. I was there and pulling that wagon, maybe for an hour or two.
But the two friends of mine already said goodbye to me because they
| knew that if you’re going to the wagon, you are through. When they saw
me coming back, like the Messiah came, because they actually---; there
were no organizers. Organizers mean somebody that can produce

something, somebody can leave something. They like praised me. We
were still a group, and we were walking from one place to another till we
came to a place that we were in front of the Russians, digging ditches to
defend the Germans. Till it came almost at the end. The Germans were
approaching, and we were remained maybe 50, maybe 100 of us on the
. road with the Germans, the German soldiers. They did not know what to

do with us. The artillery was knocking so much and fire from all places.
They wanted to leave us, but they were afraid that we will attack them.
We were afraid that they will attack us at the last minute because what
have they got to lose? Some of us guys, we were walking through on the
road, many times you see water from one side to the other, and there’s like
a little bridge. Some of us wanted to help themselves; being that it’s sort
of the end of it, wanted to run away. They went into through that tunnel,
to get from one side, hiding. But some of the Germans saw them going in.

, They went right in; shoot them in many of these places. So I was afraid to
run away and see what’s going to be the end. When the Germans—when
we remained three of us, my friends, maybe three of us together and
maybe another five or ten groups of three’s or four’s together. There were
about five Germans, SS, guarding us. Slowly, they moved away. While
they moved away, we saw some stalls; little buildings there, so we said
we'll hide there. We went in there to hide, and every time the morning
gets in closer and closer, we hear more shouting, more artillery, more this;
and then it’s quiet. We walked out, and you don’t hear anything, you

| don’t-----. We start to walk down to a town. So from the mountain, we
saw a town and said let’s go down it. At least we'll look for some clothes
because the clothes that we had, wet and this... So we got some clothes
and went into a house, and we stayed there. We saw the Russians coming
in. Meantime we started to get pails, so we’re going to get soup. SO we
started to get, three of us, we got three pails of soup. Why three pails?---
because we’re always hungry. We were afraid who knows what’s going
to be later? We ate the soup. Later on came the afternoon; we start to eat
the soup, it’s sour. So the Russians still there. We spilled it out, this soup,
and went for other soup. This what we used to do that, three times a day.
Whatever we could eat up, and the rest we spilled out till we got the other
one. We decided that we’ll go home. I was from near Warsaw. They
were also from northern Warsaw, and we went together by train, hitchhike
by train, maybe two, three days. We came back to Warsaw. Then---

Interviewer: Can you give me the friends’ names?

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

Michael Kishel: I don’t remember. One friend I remember, because one I missed. One

friend was named—he had a number 126655, 665 or 655. His name was

| Yakov (Yacov) Evans (c.999). I think that’s what he gave me. He told
me that he has a brother in Uruguay, Montevideo. I asked people from
Uruguay or Montevideo, did they ever heard a name like that. They did
not find any name like that. I looked in the registration at the American
Holocaust Survivors, at an American gathering, I did not find. Maybe, I
think he gave me the name Evans. Maybe, the name is not right, maybe it

| was different. But I did not find him. In fact, after one week, I got

liberated. After we got liberated, I went from Warsaw, from one end of
Warsaw to the other because I had to take a train to go to Kaluszyn. And
Warsaw was destroyed. So I walked from one end of Warsaw to the other
end to get another train to come to Kaluszyn. When I came on the road to
Kaluszyn, I met a guy, a Polish guy. He looked at me; he was scared
because I looked like a dead man. I told him who I am, he says, your
brother is home. That was the first good news I heard, that my brother iS
in Kaluszyn; May 15, May 20. I was sleeping and eating for two weeks.
This is how I looked after two weeks gaining 15 kilos.

Interviewer: This (c. 029)?

Michael Kishel: Pardon me?

Interviewer: I don’t know, all the ones that are marked, you want to go into the
archives?

Michael Kishel: Yes. I'll give you all those pictures that you want, and you'll give—you'll
send them back to me.

Interviewer: Right, right.

Michael Kishel: This is my brother and his wife.

Interviewer: So you went back to Kaluszyn?

Michael Kishel: I went back to Kaluszyn and I found my brother. We was staying there for
about a month, and we had to leave because before our arrival, one Jew
was killed by the National Army, National Polish Army. They claimed
that he was a Russian sympathizer, and they had to get rid of him. At the
same time, there was a few people that were hidden in villages and forests
came back and worked at the factory that they made, originally they made

, sheepskin jackets. The family name is Berman. Because of the fact that
this person was killed, they had to leave the town and since then no Jews

live there any more. We left us—my brother and I—we left for Lodz,
we’re staying there for a few months. Then we went back to Germany to
Landshut (ph) (c.059), and from Landshut we emigrate to America.

Interviewer: What year did you (c.060)?

Michael Kishel: In 1947.

Interviewer: Now, can you tell briefly what happened to you ? (c.068)

Michael Kishel: Well, the other family members that were first—at the time when there
was the liquidation. The first liquidation was in September 25, 1942, was
my mother, my sister, my mother’s sister, my aunt and her mother. Some
other cousins and my father’s relatives, my father’s brother and his family
were all in the market. They were all sent to Majdaneck, I’m sorry, not to
Majdanek, to Treblinka.

Interviewer: They all ?

Michael Kishel: They all perished, yeah.

Interviewer: Did your father ?

Michael Kishel: My father was killed, was killed in Kaluszyn on Yom Kippur night, 1942,
September 21.

Interviewer: Was he killed, was the whole committee killed then?

Michael Kishel: No, the whole committee...They were just sent for him. Before he was
killed, the SS sent for him to come. When he went to see them, they told —
him that he’s arrested. Later on they sent to inform the other members of
the Judenrat that they should inform the family to come say hello to him,
because they’re going to send him to Warsaw. When my brother and |
came to the jail where he was supposed to be, to call at the window,

; calling Father, Father, we are here waiting for you, we didn’t hear any
reply. But staying there for about 10 minutes, 15 minutes and waiting for
his reply, we heard shots which was in a square nearby. We went over
there, and then we found our father dead. It happened once before that the
SS came once and arrested my father; took him to Warsaw. He was sitting
at that time, he was in jail. In Warsaw together with Chernakoff (c. 101),
the leader of the Jewish community in Warsaw. Of course, when he came
back, he told the problems what the Warsaw has, and that no matter how
bad we have it, that they have it worse. There were many ways that the
Judenrat in our area communicated with one another. They did help each

http://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
other in many ways but there was—but they could never be ahead of the
Germans what their plans were—to realize what they want to do. They
were always trying to think that only with this law, only with this special
thing that the Jews have to do, this will be it. No more and no more; and
everything now will be good and good and good.

Interviewer: Is there anything else that you want to say (c.111)

Michael Kishel: At the moment, I don’t know.

Interviewer: You came to the United States, and you met your wife (c.121)?

Michael Kishel: I came to the United States. My wife originally is from Poland. Her
family emigrated from Poland to Costa Rica in Central America. She was
in Costa Rica. By chance, she came to New York on a business trip with
other people who are my relatives. I meet my wife that time on that trip,
and I felt that she’s a nice person for me to meet again. We met a few
times, and we decided to get married.

Interviewer: And you got married over here? |

Michael Kishel: I got married with—I got married in Costa Rica. Going to Costa Rica to
marry her. It was in January 9, or is it 87, 1949; January 9, 1949.

Interviewer: And you had three ?

Michael Kishel: We have two daughters, and we came, of course we came to live here. We
lived in Brooklyn, and then we lived in Queens; and since then I lived
there.

Interviewer: You live in Queens?

Michael Kishel: I live in Queens. [ have two daughters.

Interviewer: Are you retired?

Michael Kishel: I am now retired. I was since 1948, when I came to the first States; I got a
job as a messenger in a shipping company. This gave me a lot of—a big
break as I learned English, I believe well. I also went to night school; for
about six months I went to night school whatever it was. Then I went for
about six months to—can you imagine you get so excited that you’re
missing a word?—went to high school. I believe that I learned the
language well. To my writing, I could say is perfect, as good as any
American-born, although I believe that I have an accent. I’m not ashamed
of it. Then after learning, working for the company which is a forwarding

http://collections.ushmm.org

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
company dealing in—arranging shipments for customers overseas, who
actually introduced me to that job because they were clients of that
company. They gave business to that company to ship for them to Costa
Rica merchandise. Through them, I got the job, and I worked there for
almost two years. Then we started to go into business and to provide my
relatives in Costa Rica, who are importers, with samples of textiles and
different kind of materials; and this is how I got into the export business
which was called... In 1948, I went into the business, and we called
Kishel Brothers Trading Company. Later we incorporated, became a
corporations. Of course, our name was known in New York and a lot of
companies in the States. We had a very good name.

Interviewer: You (c.183)?

Michael Kishel: Yeah. We had a very good name, my brother and I, very well-known in
the trade of textiles and clothing, cosmetics and anything that my
customers wanted, we had. We exported merchandise to South America,
to Central America and even to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Lebanon. |
retired in 1988, after my brother got a few times, heart attacks. We
decided that business is not going to be better. I said to myself that I
would rather go out of business than be taken out. That’s what I did, and
I’m very happy for it. After all the things that I recall and think of what
happened to me, what make me so lucky? (End of Tape 2)

Tape 3

That someone was behind me, and that was my father. I always felt that
he is watching over me, and whenever I was in the biggest—I came out, I
came out with flying colors. All right, it doesn’t mean that I was always
the winner, but even when I was beaten up, but I came out alive. A
separate story about my father is written in the story that I gave about how
the ghetto works which you will see it. I will just mention one particular
instance of my father, what happened in 1940. Sometimes in 1940, the
Germans came with an order that the Jews, Kaluszyn must supply 150
men to be sent to Biala Podlaska (c.12). This is a town on the way to,
before Brest Litovsk (c.13) which there is a work camp, and they will have
to work there. Of course, nobody wanted to go there as everyone already
knew who the Germans are, and what they are, and what their stories are.
But who can say no to the Germans all the way? With all kind of work

, and all persuasions, my father was—persuaded them to take only forty—
from 150 to knock them down to 40. But only 38 went there. As soon as
the young boys came to Biala Podlaska (c.19), they had a very bad

| http://collections.ushmm.org

experience. Of course, it’s not a bad experience; they never had any other
experience because they were young boy, and there were no such things.

| They were forced to do certain types of labor. They were not used to it,
they were not accustomed. The accommodations, the life was very hard,
food was very mean and bad. From the letters that they wrote, was very
alarming to their parents. Of course, those letters came back to the

Judenrat. My father, being that he’s under practically all the
arrangements, all the things to get things done, he took a trip to Biala
Podlaska (c.26) to see if he could bring the boys back by himself. He had
to receive a permit from the county Germany, from the county Germans,
to go there, as Jews were not permitted to go by train. When he came
there, he got all the story from the boys, what they were doing. He could
only see 12 of them. The other ones, either they were at work, or they
weren’t allowed to be seen. He was talking to the Germans in that camp,
to release them, to let them go home because we need them at home; we
have industries that work for German, for the German Wehrmacht, for the
German army. For the nerve to tell the Germans to let them out, he got so
beaten up that he could not do anything and luckily he came home, was in
bed; laid in bed for about two weeks, till it came back to him. Seeing the
conditions that were there in Biala Podlaska (c.37) he decided that he must
cdo something; he cannot leave those boys there. He went to the authorities
in the county again with a story that why don’t they give us a paper that
we need those boys in a factory that is producing products for the German
army, like the sheepskin coats which the Germans need for winter clothing
and other things. This helped. Again he made a trip to Biala Podlaska
(c.43) with that letter, and he brought the boys back. As you can
sometimes see Moses going out of Egypt? Well, Moses came back with
38 people from that camp! That was my father. For this [ believe that to
same the heimel (ph) (c.46) all the time whenever I had it—was in a jam,
whatever I couldn’t do anything, he was behind me and brought me out.
As you can see, there are two pictures. One is with the synagogue
standing and around it are bombed-out houses which was done in 1939
when the Germans fought in Kaluszyn. The synagogue remained during
this time until 1941 when the Germans destroyed it and took away the

bricks to make an airfield.
