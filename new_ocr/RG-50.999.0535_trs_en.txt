>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. My
name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for
joining us today. We are in our 16th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs.
Rae Goldfarb, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2015 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation and the
Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with us
their first person accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests
serve as volunteers here at this museum. Our program will continue twice-weekly until August 13th.
The museum's website, at www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First
Person guests. It will provide information about our program when it resumes in March 2016.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can complete the
Stay Connected card in your program or speak with a museum representative at the back of the
theater. In doing so, you will also receive an electronic copy of Rae Goldfarb's biography so that you
can remember and share her testimony after you leave here today.

Rae will share with us her "First Person" account of her experience during the Holocaust and
as a Survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows we will have an opportunity for you to ask Rae a few
questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Rae is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to
help with her introduction.

| need to get the slides to come up. There we go.

Rachel Mutterperl was born to Beryl and Dina Mutterperl on December 2, 1930, in Dokszyce,
Poland, which is now in Belarus. This photo is of Rachel, who is on the left, her mother, Dina, in the
middle, and her brother, Shlomo, on the right.

On this map of Poland, the arrow indicates the location of Dokszyce. As part of an agreement
with Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union occupied Dokszyce in September 1939. Germany invaded the
Soviet Union in 1941. When German SS and police began mass killings of the Jews in Dokszyce in
1942, Rachel and her family went into hiding. A short time later, Rachel's brother was discovered by
the Germans and killed. Rachel and her mother sought shelter in the ghetto in Glebokie, a town north
of Dokszyce. The second arrow points to Glebokie.

Here we see a synagogue in the Glebokie ghetto. Rachel's mother joined a group of partisans
in the forest outside of Glebokie and became their cook with Rachel as her assistant. In the late
summer of 1944, Dina and Rachel marched with partisans to the Soviet lines where they were
liberated.

After liberation, Rachel and Dina left Poland for Italy where they stayed in the Santa Cesarea
displaced persons camp. The arrow points to the Santa Cesarea displaced persons camp in southern
Italy.

Here we see Rachel and her mother at the Santa Cesarea displaced persons camp.

In 1947, Rachel and her mother emigrated to the United States with sponsorship and support
from an aunt who had settled there previously. These pictures show Rachel's official Red Cross
documents.

After arriving in the U.S. in November 1947, Rae and her mother came to Washington, DC,
but later moved to Brooklyn where Rae finished high school. Rae went to work for the Washington, DC
court system after graduating from high school and attended George Washington University and
Baltimore Hebrew College at night.

Rae married Harvey Goldfarb, a Holocaust survivor and a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean
War, right after he left the Army. They have been married 63 years. She went back to the court after
her daughter Lynn was born. When her son Barry was born, Rae became a stay-at-home Mom. She
then went to work in the Hebrew afternoon school system.

Rae started a career in real estate in 1978 and retired 33 years later in 2011. Rae and
Harvey's two children, Lynn and Barry, are both architects and live in the Washington, DC area. Rae
and Harvey have two grandchildren, twins who will be 13 in this month and will be having their bar
mitzvah.

Both Rae and Harvey have led active lives. Rae continues to play tennis weekly. Harvey,
who is 90, ran six miles daily until he was 80. Rae says she is now "fully engaged with the Museum."
You will find Rae here on Wednesdays volunteering with Visitor Services. She took a break from a
portion of those responsibilities today in order to be with us for First Person. Rae recently spoke to
cadets at the U.S. Naval Academy. Among the audience was a young woman cadet who is a relative
of Rae's. She has also spoken at such places as retirement homes and local schools.

With that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Rae Goldfarb.

[Applause]
>> Bill Benson: Rae, thank you for joining us today and for your willingness to be our First Person.
Thank you very much. We have so much for you to share with us and just one short hour so we will
jump right in.

Before you tell us about what happened in your family during the war during the Holocaust,
let's start with you telling us a little bit about your family and your community in the years before the war
began.
>> Rae Goldfarb: My family was quite well-to-do. Both my parents were in business. My mother had a
yard good store. Clothing was made by every family. There was no department stores, no ready-made
wear. So business was pretty brisk.

My father had a dual business. We lived so close to the border. We were four kilometers
from the Russian-Polish border and there was a military garrison, barracks, nearby. And my father
supplied them with meat. And he also supplied them with some other products. He also exported
some of the products through Germany, of all places.

Both my parents were well traveled. They traveled on business. My mother to Vilna, to
Warsaw, to Lodz; my father to the German-Polish border. They had a very close relationship with a lot
of the villagers around the area because of their business. They knew a lot of the people there.

My father died before the Germans came in. He came back from a trip to deliver goods to the
German border in late 1937. He came back with some sort of an infection that the doctors could not
identify. They did not have the modern medicine nor the modern antibiotics and he passed away. He
didn't go through the horrors of the Holocaust.

My mother continued with her business and my father's business locally. The Russians
occupied Poland in 1939. She had to close her business. She distributed a lot of the fabrics to families
in the area, to villagers in the area, because she didn't want the communists to take it away.
>> Bill Benson: Before you continue with telling us about what it was like under the Communist
occupation, just a couple of other questions. How large was your extended family?
>> Rae Goldfarb: My mother was one of eight. Her sisters and brothers all had families. | don't even
know the number. I'm lucky to remember her brothers and sisters' names. | don't remember my
cousins' names. Too long ago. | should have written them down. But, you know, hindsight is better
than foresight.
>> Bill Benson: In your family, education was started. You started your education at a very young age.
>> Rae Goldfarb: My father was instrumental in starting a private school, a Hebrew school, basically,
to teach the modern Hebrew language. They needed a number of students. | was enrolled at the age
of 3. | had a governess before that so | was familiar with the alphabet and could keep up with the
classes. School was not -- children were not exposed to school in Poland until the age of 7. Sol was
way ahead of the game.
>> Bill Benson: You were way ahead.

Did you in your small town, did you have interactions with the Christian population?
>> Rae Goldfarb: My family had a lot of interactions. | don't Know about other families. | even
remember spending Christmas Eve helping to decorate a Christmas tree in one of the families that
eventually my brother was placed with. | don't remember much. | remember making ornaments out of
eggs. We would blow out the egg, make a hole in one end, hole in the ear, blow to get the contents
out, and then make a string and draw a face on it. | remember that.

| remember going to church with my brother and his -- the woman that took care of him. Both
our parents were in business and we needed help in the house. So | knew all the intricacies of what to
do in achurch. That, of course, helped later on.
>> Bill Benson: Of course, Nazi Germany attacked Poland September 1, 1939, starting World War Il.
The Soviets attacked Poland from the east on September 17. And that's when your community came
under Soviet occupation. You started to tell us what life was like under the Soviets.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Life had a big change because religion was kind of shunned. People still attended
their religious-affiliated houses of worship but it was -- they had to do it more discretely. There was a
lot of looting by the Russian soldiers. | remember my father had brought a modern alarm clock, a clock
that was standing on a counter, and a soldier picked it up and tried to fasten it to his wrist.
>> Bill Benson: Like a watch.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Like a watch. They were looking for watches, of course. That's the small stuff that
was hidden from them.

My mother always told the story about she had brought some night gowns, night wear, from
probably one of the large cities. They were silk. They looked like dresses to the Russian women.
They wore them in the street.
>> [Laughter]
>> Rae Goldfarb: You know, children remember funny stories.
>> Bill Benson: If | remember correctly, you said that the Russians thought of your family as bourgeois
and there was some worry you had that you would actually end up in Siberia. And then later --
>> Rae Goldfarb: We wished.
>> Bill Benson: You wished you had ended up in Siberia.
>> Rae Goldfarb: The Russians, in order to confiscate everything that the wealthier people had, they
came up with a program of deportation. They would tell them -- they wouldn't even tell them. They
would come in and say, "Pack your suitcase and come." They would come at night. When that
became known, in my house there was always a suitcase close by with some items. We knew Siberia
was very cold, just from the word Siberia. So we were hoping to be -- we were hoping not to be
deported. We didn't know the Germans were going to come. And since my mother was a widow at
that time, we were the last on the list. Several families were deported. Some survived. Some didn't.

We were not deported. Now, of course, we wish we were maybe. Maybe some of us would have
survived Siberia. Who knows?
>> Bill Benson: Were you able to continue education under the Russians?
>> Rae Goldfarb: Yes. School was open. We were allowed to go to school. My mother had a private
tutor at home for our Hebrew studies. So my education continued. | was fortunate enough that | was
not put in the grade by age but | was put in the grade by progress. So | actually had a little more
education than somebody my age would have gotten by that age.
>> Bill Benson: Of course, things would change dramatically in June 1941 when Germany turned on
the Soviets and attacked the Soviet Union. The German Army entered your town in the late summer of
1941. | believe by the end of 1941, Germans -- the Germans -- the Nazis forced you and the other
Jews of your town into a ghetto. What do you recall of wnat happened when the Germans came in and
being forced into the ghetto?
>> Rae Goldfarb: | remember the tanks coming in. | remember the German soldiers were throwing
candy at the population. They came in as victors. Of course, the first impression nobody thought what
followed would come.

The only reason we knew that things were going to get bad is my grandparents lived at the
edge of town -- we lived in the center of town. If you know of any small towns, you know Main Street
was the important place to live. And our house was on a main street, the main thoroughfare. It was a
large house. The businesses were in front. The house was in the back of the businesses. It was
gated off. The yard was gated off. It was along house. | remember that. And there was a warehouse
right next to it. That was the boundary, and the yard and the area with the large gate.

The Russians had put a family into our house. They evicted one of the families that were
better off and took over their residence for their own use and they moved them into my family's house.
The only reason we became aware of the German occupation was not going to be an easy one
because my grandfather remembered the German occupation of the Second World War --
>> Bill Benson: From the First World War.
>> Rae Goldfarb: The First World War. Thank you. And they were very civilized. But he saw one of
the officers, and he recognized him as somebody that was stationed in his house. He lived at the edge
of town. And this particular gentleman and some other soldiers were stationed in his house. He tried to
approach him. He waved him off. From what my mother told me, that kind of sunk into my memory, is
that he came and warned my grandfather. He said, “This Army isn't like the old Army. If you want to
speak to me, you can't do it on the street. Make a sign and I'll come and speak to you but | will not be
able to converse with you on the street." And that gave us the first inclination that things weren't going
to be good.

It was early in the war. The frontlines were moving at a very fast pace. The Russians were
retreating. And the German Army just couldn't move fast enough. The occupation was a lot different
than it was in some of the other cities in Poland. The Nazis were not quite organized in their programs.
Shortly after they occupied our area and as they were moving on, they started to take control of the
Jewish population. They formed a ghetto.

We can't show --
>> Bill Benson: No.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Ok. They formed a ghetto within an area. Our house happened to have fallen into
the area of the ghetto. They selected an area where the synagogues were because there was an
organized -- you know, the synagogues were organized around a plaza. There was a space in
between. Like a park here. | don't know. You don't have any -- | guess in small towns you still don't
have any churchyards that are big but there were about four, five synagogues. There were between
2,900 and 3,000 Jews in the town. It was a pretty sizeable town. There were about 6,000 inhabitants.
And that is within the town proper. So they selected that area.

One of the boundaries was a river. It was called the Berezina. Most of the houses on the
front had gates. So they had a natural boundary. And the back of the ghetto was fenced, barbed-wire
fence.

The ghetto was not like what you think of a ghetto, being an area where a certain group or
certain population lives. It was basically like a jail. They had guards. We could not go in and out at
leisure. The only time people could go out -- not even go out but open the gates in the front and
intermingle was on market day so that the farmers could sell their goods to anybody who had anything
to barter or had any money. But the Germans took care of that, too. The ghetto was organized where
they sort of said you're going to rule yourself. They appointed a commissioner. You understand. They
appointed a committee.

They took a number of people out to work. They would ask the able-bodied population to
come to this open area and they would select workers for their needs. Since the barracks were nearby
and they needed -- transportation was mostly by horse and buggy. There were very few automated
vehicles. So they needed cooks and laundresses, and people to take care of the horses and to clean
the stalls and to shine their boots. So they would take a certain segment of population out to work,
count them, of course, and bring them back counting them, too. At one point when it became
apparent -- you Know what happens when you're jailed? You try to think of which way to get out of
there. So a few of the men on the way back from work took off. They didn't take off so they could see
them; they would shoot them. But basically they stole a way.

When they came back and it was counted, it was found that some were missing. There were
actually four that were missing. They didn't know about one so they thought there were only three
because somebody when they started to count, somebody slipped in to make the count. The
retribution was 10-for-1. They asked the committee to select 30 people as reprimand for the escapees.
The committee offered themselves. They wouldn't take them. They asked them to actually select
people of similar age to be the scapegoats, | guess you would call them. From what | learned later,
they lined them up and machined them down. They killed them right in front of everybody. Of course,
that intimidation made people think twice before trying to escape.

It was also apparent, at that time, it was also learned, that Russian soldiers -- basically they
didn't want to fight. They laid down their arms and thought that they would become prisoners of war
and they would be fed and they would somehow escape the fighting at the frontlines. However, they
were very poorly treated. It became apparent to them that they would not survive. They were not fed
because supplies were short. They did not transport them by any kind of means other than walking.
Their shoes were torn. Their clothing was torn. They were cold. This was getting closer to winter. So
they tried to escape. Those in the front, of course, managed to escape. Those in the back got shot or
wounded. They left the wounded lying there. They would not remove the bodies. Guess who they put
to removing the bodies. The Jewish population.

Aside from that, they also collected ransom. They would ask the committee to supply a
certain amount of money, a certain amount, jewelry, gold, silver. It came down to where they were
even collecting brass and iron. Everything for the war effort.

As the frontlines moved on -- should | continue?
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about -- you told me that they began what you called to diminish the ghetto.
>> Rae Goldfarb: That's what | was going to -- they started what they called a resettlement to shrink
the ghetto. They said they were going to take the Jews to a larger ghetto because the frontlines were
so close, supposedly for our safety. They selected a certain number of Jews. It became apparent who
they selected. They started to select some young and some seniors for resettlement. And we found
out later that they were taking them to a pit and basically executing them.

So the ghetto was shrunk. My mother started to worry about what would happen. In our
house we had a hiding place. There was a space between the wall of the house and the warehouse. It
was used in previous years, too, as a hiding place because of the wars that were going on. It was also
used by my parents as sort of like a safe. We didn't have an iron safe. This was the safe, to keep
some things that were of value. The only access was through the attic. You had to climb up and go in
there. When it was apparent that the ghetto -- that they were trying to what they called the resettlement
again, we went into hiding. We went into that wall, into the space between the walls.

There was a second sort of shrinkage of the ghetto. We came out. There was no place to go,
no way to escape.
>> Bill Benson: When you would hide in there, there were several of you in this very small space.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Oh, yeah. As many as could get in.

When the ghetto was shrunk to such a point that it became so small -- we didn't have that
much time already to hide. So the only people that were able to get in -- and basically, from what my
mother told me, we slept close to the entry into the hiding place. We didn't sleep anymore. In the
ghetto we slept across the bed because there were so many people to start with. Then when ghetto
got smaller, of course, we had a little more space but we didn't sleep in our beds anymore. We slept
close to the entry to this hiding place.

With the last -- when they finally -- the final -- what they called the final closing of the ghetto,
we managed -- it came on very quickly. We didn't expect it. There was no warning at all. We heard
the knocking on the doors. They didn't even take anybody to the plaza. The other ones they asked the
people to come out to be counted. But this time there was no counting. They started to bang on the
doors and asked everybody to come out. It was the middle of the night. We climbed into this hiding
place.

My mother, my brother and |, my grandmother -- my grandfather was already taken. And
about three other children managed to get in. Before the doors were broken down. We heard the
looting. We heard the searching. My mother was very well-known. Everybody wanted to know -- the
ones that came to loot -- where we were. She had jewelry, she had this, she had that. Where is it?
They started to break things in the house, carry things out, arguing.

This was going on for about seven or eight days. It was get getting quiet. | guess most of the
things were already taken from the house. It was cleared out. We thought we could get out and try to
escape. It was nighttime. We managed to get out. We thought we were going to try to run for it but
obviously somebody was still in the house. There was another hiding place nearby. My mother pushed
us into the hiding place. She went in and the two children went in that were out there. My grandmother
was to come after us. But the voices became very close and somebody said, "There's somebody." So
she quickly covered the hiding space and she acted crazy. It must have been population that caught
her because they called the Nazis and they took her away.
>> Bill Benson: Your grandmother. They took your grandmother away.
>> Rae Goldfarb: We stayed in that place throughout the day and | don't know how much longer. We
had no food at that time. Sanitation was impossible. It was quiet. My mother said we've got to make a
run for it. She knew what to do. Let's put it this way, she knew where to go. And we went for the river
because she figured the river would be the least guarded.

We crossed the river and encountered two guards. They were local people that were given
guns to guard the ghetto. My mother recognized them. They recognized her. She told them, "I have
some jewelry with me and I'll be happy to give it to you. Put your rifles on your shoulders. Just let me
and my children go."

She had one of those -- it was like a men's watch on a gold chain. She gave it to one. She
wrapped it around his hand. She said, "Don't lose it. It's very valuable." The other one she gave some
loose -- she says, "Put out your hands." They did. And as soon as she emptied her pockets, we ran.
The two children that were with us ran in one direction. We ran in a different direction. She says
everybody scatter but she told us where to run. And, of course, we were too young to Know where so
we kind of ran with her.

We went to the house -- | told you about decorating a tree. Very good friends. We would play
with their children all the time. We were very friendly with them. He agreed to keep my brother. He
had a little boy that was about the same age. So my mother left my brother with him for safe keeping.
And she went to another house. She told him where we were going. She was hoping to place me with
that family.

We were at the second house not very long when somebody came from that other household
where my brother was -- | think she was a sister. | don't know whether the wife was a sister or his

sister. They beat up the fellow that was hiding my brother very badly. They found a Jew there.
Needless to say it became very apparent what had happened. We found out later that his own
mother-in-law had called the Nazis on him. They took my brother away. And the woman where we
were gave us some bread and told us to go hide. She told us where to go hide. She said she will
come when it gets dark and she will tell us what happened. We did. We ran and we hid.

| remember what it was. It was a bathhouse, a stone building. There were no showers and
baths in the houses, believe it or not. The bathhouse was the place where people went, usually before
the weekend. In order to go to church, they would clean up and put on some Sunday clothes. She told
us go there because nobody is going to be using it for the next few days. | don't even know what day of
the week it was. We stayed there. She came the next night and brought us some food and told us they
took my brother away and, from what she heard, he was shot. She told us not to stay because they
were looking for us. So we started to try to get away.

The woman that took care of my brother was the one that my mother thought of next because
she was like a member of the family. Unfortunately maybe if we had run to her house but she was
further away. It took us all night to get to her house from where we were. She told us she's afraid to
hide us because now that it is known that my mother is escaping, that they would probably come to her
house. But she said she would go to town and see if my brother was still alive. She would try to plead
to give her the child because she's childless and she raised him from infancy.

We hid in the fields. The corn was pretty high at that point already. We hid in the fields and
she went into town. She came back at night and told us that he was shot. She brought us some
provisions. Again, day and night. The day we hid. At night we walked.

We got to a farm of a woman who was widowed. My father helped her keep the farm. She
was French. She had no family. She married this gentleman and came to live with him on his farm. It
was a rather large farm. She had two children. She had a son and a daughter. The daughter was
close to my age. And the son was older. She kept us overnight but she was afraid to keep us because
the farmers from adjoining farms came to help her with the chores. Her son couldn't do them. She and
her son couldn't do them all by herself. The only place she could hide us was in out buildings or in her
house. The farmhouses were basically one big room. The sleeping quarters were only blocked off by a
curtain. So hiding us in the barn was difficult when you have people coming to do the chores.

The next day was a market day. She dressed me in her daughter's clothing. She dressed my
mother in her clothing. They loaded the wagon for the market to take the produce to the market. Her
son drove the wagon. She took a tremendous chance because if they would catch us, they would
probably be put to death, too.

We got off in the marketplace, mingled for a while with the farmers there. It was more distant.
The farmers didn't quite know my mother. She was dressed like one of the farmers. In the late
afternoon when the people were coming back from work into the ghetto, we stole in with them into the
ghetto.
>> Bill Benson: So you returned to another ghetto.
>> Rae Goldfarb: We went to another ghetto that was more distant with a much bigger town. There
was a little bit of industry there. They took the people also to work in some of the industry.

The Germans were not used to the climate of Eastern Europe and Russia. They needed
socks, wool socks, gloves, hats, scarves, sweaters. So they put the people in the ghetto to work
knitting. They took people out to work. And they took people basically to the spinning mills because
that's where the yarn -- the wool was being spun.

My mother knew some people in that ghetto. Even though they had already shrunk the ghetto
some, they still had an industry to be able to keep them alive. We needed documents. There was no
way to get documents because everybody had something to show that they were in the ghetto. It just
so happened that one of the girls had been taken away and her papers were left at home. Sol! was
made older. | was really born in 1932 but all my paperwork is 1930. Because my mother wanted to
make sure that | would qualify to go to work. This was 1942. According to the paperwork | was 12
even though | was only 10.

>> Bill Benson: So at 12 you would be more likely to be allowed to work.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Oh, yeah. They took 12-year-old girls to work. 10-year-old girls they had no use for.
So | had a way of going out to work which meant access to the outside. My job at the spinning mill was
to tie the threads. If a thread broke, you know, from the spinning, | would have to quickly catch the two
ends and tie them. My fingers became very nimble.
>> Bill Benson: Rae, | know you have so much more to tell us. In Glebokie, in the ghetto, your mother
was determined to get out of there. She wanted to join the partisans in the forest. Tell us what she did
from there.
>> Rae Goldfarb: All right. Mother was in touch with some of my father's friends through the
marketplace. Since the Jews were allowed to buy from farmers, she was able to get in touch with one
of the farmers that was a very good friend of my father's and also had a lot of fabrics hidden with him.
And mother told the farmers, use what you need, sell what you need, and give me what | need.
Basically a barter system.

At first she tried to organize something. She was very resourceful. She tried to organize a
group to get out of the ghetto. In order to be accepted by the partisans, mother felt that if she brought
along some people that were of use to them that we would be accepted, too. And there was a doctor
that was willing to try to escape.

A tunnel was dug under the fence. The group that she had organized, we were going to try to
get out through that tunnel and run for our lives, of course. But somebody got wind of it. A couple of
guys went and used the tunnel before it was properly -- a group was properly organized and organized
on the outside for somebody to receive us, some of the farmers that were friends because you couldn't
run fast enough, unless you had some horses there. They went out and they were caught. The tunnel
was compromised.

Mother decided no more trying to organize anything. It was just she and I. She and her
daughter. She was determined she was going to save her child. She wasn't thinking about saving
herself. She got this gun from my father's friend, a farmer, smuggled to her in a basket of eggs; straw
on the bottom, the gun, straw on top, and eggs on top of it. The Germans were very finicky. They
wouldn't do anything to dirty their hands or to mess things up. Any mess they didn't like. So eggs were
a good thing to carry. You could easily break an egg and they wouldn't try to touch anything. On
market day we were dressed in the farmers clothing and we ventured out and we continued on.
>> Bill Benson: With the basket with the gun in tt.
>> Rae Goldfarb: With the basket, the gun there. Well, if we were caught, it was death no matter how.
If we remained in the ghetto, we knew what would happen to us. If we were caught on the way, we
knew what would happen to us. It was a bullet no matter which way.

SO we managed to escape and to walk -- we were stopped -- there weren't too many
vehicles -- by a truck with Germans. They saw two women walking. They asked us where we were
going. We were going home from the market. They offered us a ride. Mother knew the villages, as
she said, a close-by village. She's going from there. There are no roads. We're going to have to walk.
We got in the truck. It kind of helped along we didn't have to walk as far.

We got off and we took off. We walked until mother Knew more or less where the partisans
were. Some of the people managed to escape and managed to get word back. Actually, a woman who
was a midwife managed to escape. She became the head of the hospital. There was nobody else that
knew how to stitch up wounds. We found out later. We managed to escape. We came to the edge of
the forest and encountered partisans. It was a small group. It was actually a reconnaissance group.
They agreed -- mother said she's a very brave woman and she has a gun.
>> [Laughter]
>> Rae Goldfarb: They took us in. Mother became the cook. | became the helper. | know how to peel
potatoes, I'll tell you that.
>> [Laughter]
>> Rae Goldfarb: And fast. Really fast.

>> Bill Benson: So, Rae, it's almost so difficult to imagine. Here you are a little girl with your mom now
hiding with partisans in the forest. What was that life like during the time you were with them?
>> Rae Goldfarb: What was life like? Well, a lot of it was work. A lot of it was work. Some of it -- there
were other kids. They were under the protection of the partisans because the Germans were
confiscating cattle, horses especially and cattle. They needed to feed their Army. They couldn't
possibly provide as fast as they were moving.

If any of you have studied history, you know that the German Army was so successful they
couldn't move fast enough into Russia.

So they confiscated a lot of things from the farmers. So the farmers were happy the partisans
were there because that was some protection. They grow their cattle further into the forest, into
clearing areas where the cattle could grays. And they could come and milk the cows. They could take
care of their daily needs. And the partisans kept the Germans away because they didn't want to
engage into anything. They were interested in occupying Russia; then they'll take care of the back side
of it.

However, the Russian fronts kind of stopped. It was wintertime. The Germans were not
prepared to go into the winter. They were extremely cold. The winters were very cold. We had winter
from about October until Easter. That would give you an idea of how cold it was, a lot of snow.
Vehicles couldn't move. There were no roads. Forget about roads. The roads were mainly
cobblestone. They were pretty much pitted from a lot of movement. So moving wasn't easy.

Also, the Russian soldiers that had managed to escape -- and more and more
escaped -- organized themselves in the forest. Some of them went behind the lines. The lines weren't
that distinct. Some of them went behind the lines to tell what was happening and trying to get help.
The Russian military sent some officers to help to organize the partisans into a fighting group.

For a while everything went along ok. I'm going to make it shorter. | realize we're almost at
the time and we have a long story.
>> Bill Benson: And you have a very pivotal part to tell us about getting captured.
>> Rae Goldfarb: So the partisans were pretty much organized. The main thing that they were trying
to do -- not trying to kill Germans because they didn't want to start a fight. What they were doing was
trying to sabotage the movement to the frontlines, basically the train. If you know about trains, if you
loosen the ties under the rails, you know what happens to a train? It derails. And when the train
derails, they would lose some of the ammunition and some of the guns. Whatever they could carry
away. And, of course, the Germans tried to right the trains. It took time. That way they sabotaged the
progress to the front. The frontlines started to move back. They had a front in the front and a front in
the back.

The Germans basically -- they were not surrounded but they had to fight their way out.

Unfortunately for me, | got sick with Typhus. So we got disjoined from our group because |
was taken -- there was a field hospital set up further into the forest. This woman -- the reason | told you
about this woman that was a midwife, she was in the forest in this hospital. My mother took me in to
her to help heal me. Fortunate for me she took good care of me. However, we got disjoined from our
group. And as the Germans did a blockade on the partisans, we were with no one.

In order to find the partisans, they started to move the population into one of the towns so that
they do searches where the partisans were and dispose of them. They had to fight two fronts.
Unfortunately we were brought to our hometown. We were in a distant village. The villagers did not
know my mother but in the town she was afraid to show her face. And | had to basically go scrounge
for food.

My head was shaved. | was dressed like a boy. They started to separate the men from the
women of the villagers. They brought me up and argued whether I'm a girl or a boy. From Yiddish |
knew quite a bit of German. I'm pretty good with languages. So being afraid of being separated from
my mother | said one word that got us into trouble. I'm a girl. If | know the word, then | must be Jewish
and my mother was hiding a Jewish child.

My mother, of course, ran out. She started to argue with them. No, I'm her child and I'm not
Jewish. She's not Jewish. And my mother spoke mostly Polish amongst the population because they
either spoke Russian or Belarus and very few of them knew of cultured Polish. So they called us the
bourgeois, higher class. And even though she said she'd much rather be hate as a bourgeois than as a
Jew.

So she came out and she told the soldiers that I'm her daughter. She started to argue with
them. She said they put us under hanging tree. It was a bar with nooses. I'll never forget that. If she's
your child — “if you agree that she is Jewish, I'll just hang her; however, you're going to be left alive.”
She says, "This is my child. I'd sooner you hang me first. | will not see my child die."

They decided that my mother was telling the truth and they let us go. However it became very
unsafe of where we were. So as some of the villagers were let go, we ventured with them. Again,
mother chose distant villages. However, in that village she was trying to find where the partisans were
so that we could rejoin a group and be safe.

Eventually she managed -- I'm not going to go through how and what. We managed to join a
partisan group and we were liberated in the summer of 1944.
>> Bill Benson: | think, Rae, it's obvious to everybody in this room that your mother was this
remarkable, courageous, resourceful, smart lady.
>> Rae Goldfarb: Unbelievably, unbelievably resourceful. She had a very focused -- she was very
focused on what she wanted to do.
>> Bill Benson: In the little time we have left, tell us about your liberation and what, again, your mother
did immediately in the aftermath of it.
>> Rae Goldfarb: After liberation we went back to Glebokie, the larger town, to be, you know, safer.
There was a group of Jews that survived, gathered there. We all lived in one house. However, she
had some valuables hidden in our house. She actually had our house torched. When the partisans
went out in their skirmishes -- since this was a garrison town, there were military stationed, she asked
them to torch the house. She didn't want anybody to live in the house.

However, she knew where she had hidden some stuff. And we had to survive. We had to
have something tangible to survive on. She knew where it was. She went to the town, first of all to see
if anybody else survived. Because where do people go when they look for other families? They go to
the place where they came from. However, there was nobody there. She dug up the few things that
she knew where they were hidden.

One of the neighbors, who was a very friendly neighbor us, came out and said -- she started
to ask her if anybody came back, if she knew of anybody, who survived. She said nobody came back.
But the picture you saw of me, my mother, and my brother this woman gave to my mother. She said
she picked it up from the trash. | still have it encased in plastic because it's so fragile. But | made
copies of it. She gave it to my mother. She said, "I loved you. | wish | could do something but | can't
do anything for you. You're welcome to stay the night but | don't guarantee you are going to survive
because there's a lot of belligerence still going on." She gave my mother bread and my mother went on
her way.

She came back to where we were in Glebokie and said we've got to get out. Since she was a
partisan, she was accepted as a volunteer worker on a train. Basically she enlisted with the Russians.
The train was going to different railroad stations to fix the water towers. The trains were running on
steam. We were living on the train. Basically we had a corner with a bed, a palate. She took enough
supplies with her. We had plenty of potatoes. We got as far with the train to Prussia. Conditions in
Prussia were horrible. The Prussians mined everything. They mined even themselves. The military
mined themselves so when the Russian soldiers came to remove the bodies, they would blow up. If
you went one step off the path, you blew up.

Mother peeled potatoes. She was going to throw out the peels. We had plenty of potatoes at
that time. There was a military, a Russian military, hospital train on the next track. The doctor came
out and says, "Don't throw that away. I'll make soup for my people. We have nothing to eat." Mother
gave him, of course, the peels. She gave him some potatoes. He says, “Look, it's very dangerous.”

Mother wanted to get across, out of Russia, out of the Russian occupation area. She thought by going
west eventually we'll get there. He said, "Look, there is a big gathering of Jews." We didn't know at the
time he happened to have been Jewish. "I would suggest you get yourself attached to a train going
south and get out of here because it's very dangerous." Trying to move the wounded as quick as
possible out. He knew some of the people there. He attached -- got our car attached to a train that
was heading there and we ended up where there was a gathering of Jews.
>> Bill Benson: Rae, we're going to close the program now. As | think it's probable evident, there's --
not only has Rae had to skip over an awful lot of what she went through, there is a great more to be told
about what happened in the immediate aftermath of the war, their attempts to get to Israel, ending up in
a displaced persons camp in southern Italy, and eventually making it to the United States and
beginning a new life.

I'm going to turn the program back over to Rae --
>> Rae Goldfarb: Can | say something?
>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.
>> Rae Goldfarb: | was going to say if you want to hear the rest of the story, you know -- | left you in
the middle -- go to ushmm.org. Look up Rachel Goldfarb and you'll hear the whole story. You can skip
the first part and go to the last part.
>> [Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: There's a lot in the first part also worth looking at that you did not hear today.

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So I'm going to turn to
ray to close the program. A couple of things, first. One, when Rae is finished, our photographer, Joel,
will come up on stage and take a photograph of Rae with you as the backdrop. We're going to ask you
at that point to stand so that we can get this photo with you in the background. Because we didn't have
an opportunity for questions and answers with Rae, Rae will remain behind for a little while. Ray,
afterwards?
>> Rae Goldfarb: Yes. I'll be at the Information Desk, too.
>> Bill Benson: But before she does that, she'll stay right here.
>> Rae Goldfarb: | can stay right here. | can stay right here.
>> [Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: We're going to tell you that if you want, please come up on stage and say hi to Rae,
get your photograph taken with her, ask her the question you would have asked otherwise.

Thanks for being here. We have three more programs this year. We'll resume again in March
2016.

On that note, Rae?
>> Rae Goldfarb: | just want to tell you, I'm doing this. It's not easy; however, | feel that | need to
honor my family that has perished and the whole town that has perished and a lot of other people that
have perished. Unless we tell the story, there is no way we can prevent anything like this from
happening again.

It is very difficult to understand what really we went through, especially here in the United
States. I'ma citizen now. | know. We're exposed to a lot of wonderful things here. Value your
freedom. Don't be intimidated by anybody. Don't succumb to any pressures from anybody, especially
you children. Don't allow to be bullied into anything that you don't think is right to do. And you adults,
teach your children to be tolerant. That's the most important thing.

This museum exists in order to prevent any such things from happening again and it can
happen anyplace. It's happening in a lot of places right now. People that don't suspect of what they
are going to face. A lot of refugees trying to escape. | know how it felt to be a refugee with no home,
no family, no help.

Thank you for coming.

[Applause]
