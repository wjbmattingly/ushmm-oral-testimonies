>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person.
Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 17th year of the First Person program. Our First
Person today is Mr. George Pick, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2016 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We
are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with us
their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person
guests serve as a First person guests serve as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program
will continue twice weekly until mid August. The museum's website, listed on the back of your
program, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests. The address is
www.ushmm.org.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can complete
the Stay Connected card in your program or speak with a museum representative at the back of
the theater. In doing so, you will receive an electronic copy of George Pick's biography so that
you can remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.

George will share his "First Person" account of his experience, during the Holocaust and
as a survivor, for about 45 minutes. If time allows at the end of our program, we'll have an
opportunity for you to ask George a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from George is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide
presentation to help with his introduction.

George, or Gyorgy in Hungarian, Pick was born March 28, 1934 in Budapest, Hungary to
Istvan and Margit Pick. Hungary is highlighted on this map of Europe in 1933. Istvan was an
engineer and Margit was a legal secretary. Pictured here are Istvan and Margit with their
newborn son Gyorgy. Here we see George and his two cousins in a miniature horse-drawn
carriage in a park in Budapest in 1941. George is seated in the front of the carriage. George
attended school in Budapest. Here we see George on a seesaw in nursery school and George

is circled.

This is a Mother's Day card that George made in the first grade. And here is George with
his non-Jewish neighbors in 1943. After Hungary allied itself with Nazi Germany Istvan and
Margit lost their jobs due to new laws restricting the participation of Jews in the economy.
Istvan was then conscripted into the Hungarian labor battalions. German troops occupied
Hungary in March 1944 and the Pick family was first forced to move into buildings marked with
the yellow star, like that seen in this photo. That fall the family went into hiding. But the Pick
family was discovered, the children were taken, and George was placed in a home with 500
other children. George and another boy escaped and went back to their hiding place where
George was reunited with his parents. Two weeks later the entire family was sent to the ghetto.
They were liberated from the ghetto by the Soviets in January 1945. In this 1946 photograph,
we see George with a group of survivors, all of whom the Pick family had been in hiding with.
The circle is on George. Following the war George lived in Hungary where he earned a degree
in engineering until late 1956 when he escaped from Hungary and made his way to the United
States to live with his uncle in New Jersey. After working as laborer George got a scholarship
for an intensive English language course at Temple University in Philadelphia. He then went to
work for Westinghouse as an engineer. George would later teach engineering at the Catholic
University of America here in the District of Columbia. After earning his Ph.D. he worked for the
US Navy as an aerospace engineer from 1966 to 1995, retiring from federal service as a
technical director at Navy headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia.

While George continues to do consulting work, a great deal of his time is spent working on
two books. He recently completed his autobiography and is currently looking for a publisher.
The second is a scholarly work about the history of 40 Jewish communities in a particular
region of Hungary that he is currently writing.

George and his wife Leticia Flores Pick, who retired from the Mexican Foreign Service,
live in Arlington, Virginia. George performs several roles as a volunteer here at the museum.
He speaks frequently, especially at local high schools and universities, for the Speakers
Bureau. He has also spoken at such places as the National Defense University and the
Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General. George also works for the Education
Department and Visitor Services here at this museum. You will find George here every other
Sunday where he works with the museum's Movie Series.

George also is a professor at the Encore Learning Center of George Mason University in
Virginia where he conducted a seven-part series on the Holocaust this past fall. This fall he will
teach a series on "Classical and Quantum Physics" at the Encore Learning Center. George also
works with ReSET, an organization of volunteers that teaches science. He has just finished
teaching 3rd graders at the Barrett Elementary School in Arlington, Virgina. | also want To note
that if this is not enough, this is the 20th year that George will lead a group of women ina
summer water-aerobics program 3 times a week.

With that | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. George
Pick.

(Applause)

>> George Pick: Thank you, thank you.

>> Bill Benson: George, thank you so much for joining us today and your willingness to
be our First Person. An hour is such a short time and | know you have just so much to share
with us so we'll start right away. George, you were nearly four and a half years old when
Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, beginning World War Il. Tell us about your

family and your community in the years that led up to the war and to the Holocaust.

>> George Pick: My family has ties and roots in what then was called the
Austro-Hungarian Empire. And | have documentation that roughly two and a half centuries ago
was the time that the families moved into this area. We were part of or at least my
grandparents and great grandparents were part of the emancipated Jewish community. Not
very, very, just -- but Jewish nevertheless, and they kept the cultural roots of course. Most of
my family members from the professionals, engineers, lawyers, doctors, businessmen and the
extended family lived all around the Empire. Places where now is what we would think is the
Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and Romania and Serbia and Austria. So not all of
the family lived in what is now --

>> Bill Benson: What is now --

>> George Pick: Geographically in Hungary. Now all my grandparents came from large
families, 9 to 12 children so.

The extended family was quite large. Over 200 people. | did some genealogical survey
and | found roughly about 150 relatives up to the second cousin level. And during the first world
war my grandfathers and their brothers have served with distinction in the Austrian Hungarian
Army, most of them as officers. And many of them earned medals for their valor. However,
that didn't help them after the Austro-Hungarian Empire lost the war. Hungarian was chopped
up to many little pieces. The original Hungarian territory was all -- what they call the -- the
Hungarian historical land was lost roughly two thirds of them was lost to Romania, the
Czech -- Czechoslovakia Republic, Serbia, Croatia, and so forth. And so my relatives all of a
sudden from -- being in one country, now lived in one in three or four countries. And after this
catastrophic war for Hungary, Hungary became a small state and the -- one of the
consequences of this was the rise of anti-semitism. The Jews were in many places throughout
history the scapegoats of all the bad things which had happened with countries or people or
places. So the Hungarians were again blamed, and the very first anti-Jewish law in Europe
took place in Hungary in 1921.

>> Bill Benson: Well predating the Nuremburg laws.

>> George Pick: Well before even Hitler arose.

>> Bill Benson: Right.

>> George Pick: And this particular law excluded Jewish students from higher education.
More precisely what this law did, and it's called Numerus Clausus, is to say that the Jews are
5% of the population so the people who are in higher institutions will have to be 5%. Now,
realize that the Jews were very well represented in these fields, particularly the law and medical
fields, more than 50% of the students were Jewish. So --

>> Bill Benson: That meant they had to be shrunk back to 5%.

>> George Pick: Correct. And, for example, | had an uncle who was my mother's brother,
older brother, and he was studying medicine. He was in third year in one of the larger medical
schools and they kicked him out, physically, not just him but many of the other students. And
their only way of continuing studies was to go abroad. And this is what my uncle did. He went
to Italy and it took him eight years before he was able to finish his studies and became a
full-fledged --

>> Bill Benson: And your mother, who had had some legal training --

>> George Pick: Right.

>> Bill Benson: -- one of the reasons she worked, however, was related to your uncle.
Tell us a little bit about that.

>> George Pick: Yeah. Well, my mother finished her training at age 16 and went to work
as a secretary and most of her salary went to her brothers, the older brother who was studying
in Italy and the younger brother who was studying in Germany. He was an optometrist, so he
became an optometrist. So it was expected that the men in the family would get the higher
education and the women would only get as much as commercial.

>> Bill Benson: That she was working to help pay for their education.

>> George Pick: Correct. And she was working help their education. And my uncle
eventually, he went through various countries and eventually ended up in Hungary. It was very
hard for a Jewish physician to find a job. And it was very frustrating for him. And of course, the
big depression also hit Hungary just like every other country in Europe, and so he -- he was
looking for a job very unsuccessfully. He worked in jobs which didn't pay at all.

So by 1938 he was able to immigrate to the United States and that's what he did. And
here he had a hard time but eventually he finished whatever requirements were, got a license
and he became a practice here --

>> Bill Benson: Here if the United States. And of course we don't have time to talk about
many of your other family members, but both not only highly educated but some really
significant people. George was telling me earlier that in doing research for his quantum physics
course he found a -- a relative of his grandfather's who Einstein consulted over mathematics to
get his formulas correct. And I'm misphrasing that, I'm sure. And another relative teamed with
Dr. Alzheimer's to help find Alzheimer's Disease and related dementia. So, | mean, education
was such a huge part of your family.

George, while the full brunt of the war would not come to Hungary until 1944, the lives of
Jews in Hungary including Budapest would change significantly once war began. Tell us what
you can about your life, your family's life, during those years after the war began in Europe but
before it really came to Hungary.

>> George Pick: Okay. Well, Hungary was an ally of Germany for political reasons
and -- but it was a -- they were a reluctant ally. They wanted to be allied with the western
countries but because of the unfortunate geography, there was just no way to do it. So they
ended up being an ally of Germany. And after 1933 when Hitler took power, of course one of
Hitler's big pogroms was an anti-Jewish pogrom. First they wanted to get rid of all the Jews
and after the war began. That pogrom became an extermination or genocide pogrom. So
Hungary had to, to a certain degree, follow this policy. But just to a certain degree. And the
first anti-Jewish law which was fairly comprehensive and against Jewish economic interests
came to pass in 1938. My father lost his job because he was Jewish and many of my uncles
and so forth. So that was the first blow. Later the second Jewish -- anti-Jewish law came into
effect which had a -- an addendum which had essentially said that people who were not
trustworthy, namely the communists, the socialists, and the Jews, would not be able to serve in
the regular Army service. But they would have to serve in a label service where they would of
course not have weapons but they would have tools to --

>> Bill Benson: Picks and shovels.

>> George Pick: Picks and shovels and stuff like that, to do these type of things. And my
father was among the very first indoctrinated in 1940, this was when | started my first
elementary school education, he went to the northeastern section of Hungary which is now part
of Ukraine and he and many others were participating in doing construction of strategic roads
actually.

>> Bill Benson: So they were taken out of their professions, whatever their professions

https://collections.ushmm.org

)
might be, and sent to build roads and do really horrible things that they were forced to do.

>> George Pick: Right, yeah. Now, imagine that these people were mostly intellectuals.

>> Bill Benson: Right.

>> George Pick: Engineers and so forth, and so physically they were not very well fit and
they had to do this kind of work. And of course it was physically very, very bad. Fortunately at
that time the Christian soldiers who were supervising them, they were still humane and they
were not trying to kill them with the labor. They were working very hard but they were still
respected as human beings.

And three months later my father was decommissioned and he came back. Now, the
question was always or | usually get the question so how did you make a living?

>> Bill Benson: That was my next question, how do you make ends meet?

>> George Pick: How do you make ends meet? There were roughly 25,000 Jews of
whom probably 150,000 Jewish men who were unemployed so how do you make a living.
There was a system called "Strawman" or "Strohman" in German, which means that there was
aman, a Christian person, who would take out a license to do business and that person would
then take a Jew or two under his license and on paper it looks like he was the employer and the
Jews were the employees which was legal at that time. But in fact the Jews were given money
to this person who took out the license and they did the work. And it was -- | don't know why,
you can probably call ita gray market, but as the war was coming and then started, the market
turned out to be pretty good, if you were in the market. Now, Hungary had a very interesting
story as far as the war was concerned. The war started September 1,1939, but the Hungarians
were neutral until June of 1941. So there was a window of time when people theoretically could
get out. So my uncle who was already here --

>> Bill Benson: The one you told us about earlier.

>> George Pick: Correct, the one who was the doctor. Was trying to send us papers to
come to the United States. Unfortunately, because of the United Statesâ€™ policy, we got to
the -- on the waiting list and we were going to be able to come no earlier than 1943, which was
entirely too late.

>> Bill Benson: Right.

>> George Pick: Of course. And so we got stuck there. And in 19 -- in 1941-'42, when
the full brunt of the genocide, the Holocaust already hit Poland and Czechoslovakia and other
countries, did not hit us. And the reason why not, because of the regent of Hungary, who was
Horthy, refused to provide the Germans with the Hungarian Jews. But we had some relatives
from Austria and Slovakia mainly who were able to come to Hungary legally and we gave them
shelter and illegal papers and they were able to provide for them for two years until 1944 when
the Germans came in. They lived in -- as illegal aliens in Hungary.

Now, they were telling us about ghettos and concentration camps and deportations, and
we looked -- looked at them and listened to them, but we were absolutely convinced that it
could never happen

>> Bill Benson: Not in Hungary.

>> George Pick: Not in Hungary because Hungary is just Hungarians, it's just different
from everybody else.

>> Bill Benson: Even though they had had these stringent anti-Jewish laws, the belief
was they would not go to those extremes.

>> George Pick: Correct. Correct. And so somehow we made ends meet. And in
1943 -- in 1942 the Hungarians, as | mentioned, finally joined the war and they were told by

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
6
Hitler to put together an Army. And they did that in the summer of 1941. And also Jewish men,
50,000 of them, were brought in --

>> Bill Benson: To the labor battalions.

>> George Pick: For the labor battalions, right. My father was fortunately a year older
than the 20-40 year -- years and so he didn't get in there. But many of my uncles and cousins,
second cousins, did. And they were taken to the Ukraine. And the Hungarian -- this was in the
summer of 1941-42.

>> Bill Benson: '42.

>> George Pick: The Hungarians were not very anxious to get involved in there. And
they didn't think that it -- the war is going to last so long. And so the -- both the Hungarian Army
and the labor battalions were very poorly equipped, particularly the clothes for the Russian
winter. And so thousands of people of course died, frozen to death and beaten to death.

By then the Hungarian labor battalions were led by rather Nazi sympathizers and people
who were told that you could come home as soon as the last Jew is dead. So it gave them a
great -- some sort of a great emotional support to kill Jews. And you could read today in many
books the bestiality which was used on these people. | lost a couple of uncles and second
cousins also there.

In January of 1943 there was a catastrophic event for both the German Army and the
Hungarian Army, particularly when the Germans lost Stalingrad and the Soviets had a
counteroffensive and part of the front-line troops were Hungarian, and the Soviets just rolled
over them. And 150,000 people were killed or captured in five days of fighting in Voronezh
which was on the eastern part of -- or western part of the Don River. And of the 50,000 Jewish
laborer, roughly 42,000 were killed. And only about 5,000 survived coming back.

>> Bill Benson: And for you, George, still you're young, the war was still somewhat distant
from you. You described to me an incident that you experienced with your mom, | believe, in
1943 that was your first kind of personal real sense of the -- will you tell us about that?

>> George Pick: Sure. My father was inducted again '43 --

>> Bill Benson: This time his age didn't matter.

>> George Pick: His age didn't matter that much. And for three months he was working
In -- again in construction site somewhere in Transylvania and after he came back we decided
to have a very short vacation. Jews could even have vacations there, which is unbelievable
because most of the Jewish communities in Europe were already dead.

So we went out and my mother and | at one point walked in a little -- we went on a fairly
nice hotel, in a hotel, and we were walking and we saw a group of people, Nazis, who were in
the Hungarian Nazi uniform and they were singing and yelling Nazi slogans. And they looked
pretty much a wild bunch, and we were quite frightened. That was the first time | have seen
any kind of groups that are recognizably Nazi

>> Bill Benson: Is that what is known as the Arrow Cross?

>> George Pick: Yes, correct. The Arrow Cross had black uniforms with green shirts and
they were eventually --

>> Bill Benson: The Hungarian fascist.

>> George Pick: The Hungarian fascists.

>> Bill Benson: Did you know -- | mean, as you said, you had people that were refugees
coming in and telling what they -- what they had experienced or knew. Did you have a sense of
what was going on in the war during that time, for example, that the Germans had lost at
Stalingrad? Did you know those things?

>> George Pick: We knew the Germans lost to Stalingrad because as | said the
Hungarian Army was --

>> Bill Benson: Was decimated.

>> George Pick: -- was decimated so there was a period of | think three days of
mourning. So that was well-published. And of course, we did not know what the contact for the
Jewish laborers but we figured most of them had been buried and killed and died. So this was
1943. And then 1944 came along -- around, namely March of 1944. Now, by 1943 even the
high command of the Germans knew that the war was lost. And some of them tried to kill Hitler.
In fact there were a number of assassination attempts. None of them were unfortunately
successful. And so the war went on. In March of -- March 19 to begin -- to be exact of 1944,
the German Army marched into Hungary. Now, the reason why they did that is they knew that
the Hungarians behind the -- the curtains were talking to the British as well as the Soviets to
switch sides or become neutral. And so they no longer trusted the Hungarians with reason.
And so they found that Hungary, which was a strategic retreat for them, could not be just left
alone.

So they came in and the parts of the SS, Hitler's group, particularly the group of people
who are -- who were in charge of the final solution, all this frustrated by the fact that there
was -- there were still 825,000 Jews in Hungary, the largest group in Europe at that time

>> Bill Benson: Had yet largely not be touched in the same way as --

>> George Pick: Correct, exactly. So the first thing they did after they occupied Hungary,
maybe four or five days later, a small (inaudible) command they called it, came in, about 120
SS officers, and their business was to organize the quick deportation of the Jews. And
everything which had happened in four long years, five years and in Germany even ten years
happened in weeks in Hungary. And so the first thing was that the Jews had to wear a yellow
star. It turns out that it was a very memorable day for me because it was around my birthday,
my tenth birthday when | had to wear the yellow star. And the first thing they did -- now, a new
government came to power in Hungary also, a pro-fascist government. And they already had
their script. They knew precisely what to do and how fast and so forth. So the first thing was to
sever all communications and transportations between the provinces and the capital. Most of
my family lived in the provinces. From one day to another we couldn't telephone them, we
couldn't communicate with them. And then Jews were not allowed to take trains or even
bicycles. In fact, bicycles and automobiles were all confiscated. And so we had no idea what
went on in the provinces. In Budapest we knew that there were demands on us in terms of
giving everything which was valuable to the new fascist government.

Meanwhile in the provinces, already as early as April, middle of April, which was --

>> Bill Benson: Just weeks after the Germans came in.

>> George Pick: Just weeks, they had concentrated Jews and there were
Jewish -- Jewish parts of cities and villages and they were concentrated in certain parts, usually
the worst part of the city. And these were transit camps. And by the middle of May they started
to deport them. And in six weeks 437,000 people were deported, over --

>> Bill Benson: To places like Auschwitz.

>> George Pick: Mostly Auschwitz. Mostly.

>> Bill Benson: The numbers are almost beg your imagination. Almost 440,000 in six
weeks.

>> George Pick: In six weeks. In 146 trains. Imagine this is the -- toward the end of the
war. The trains obviously could be used for --

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
8

>> Bill Benson: The war effort.

>> George Pick: -- the war effort. They would divert these trains and use them
exclusively to deport these people. And then they got to Auschwitz, 90% of them were killed in
the gas chambers and then burned in the crematorium. In two or three hours. They had new
crematorium built for this purpose, and every day 12,000 Hungarian Jews were deported there
and selected out. And at one point the heat of the crematorium was so big that one of them
blew up because of the human bodies. And then when they couldn't -- couldn't burn them, they
burned them in open pits. And there are -- here in the museum there are pictures which show
this.

>> Bill Benson: And George, for you and your parents, you're still in Budapest at that
time. At some point | think the word you used was your father just disappeared.

>> George Pick: Yeah.

>> Bill Benson: What happened?

>> George Pick: Well, | should say that after -- shortly after the Germans came in, all
Jewish men between the age of 20 -- 16 actually and 60 were confined in these camps, these
labor camps. My father was one of them. And he moved to the north of the -- western edge of
Hungary. And he was doing fortifications for the Germans. And so in Budapest there were only
men, old men, young women, and children. That's it.

>> Bill Benson: Children.

>> George Pick: It was still the largest community, roughly 160,000 people there. And
what happened there first was Budapest was 25% Jewish. They called them Jewdapest
actually. And they were living all over the place. So the first thing was to try to concentrate
them. But they couldn't concentrate them in a ghetto because it would have taken too much
time. So they concentrated people in certain houses called Jewish houses. They had a big
yellow star --

>> Bill Benson: Like you saw in the picture.

>> George Pick: Yeah, you saw the picture. And they were concentrating roughly 25% of
the population into 5% of the area. Our building was not designated as a Jewish building, so
my father -- my mother and my grandmother and myself, we had to move in with relatives which
were --

>> Bill Benson: In a so-called Jewish building.

>> George Pick: In a so-called Jewish building. And the rule was that you had to have
four people per room and so we moved into a one-bedroom apartment plus each apartment at
that time had a maid room, maid's room, so we had ten people in this place which would be
ten -- maybe 1,000 square feet area.

>> Bill Benson: And ten people squeezed into that.

>> George Pick: And ten people squeeze in. Now, life there is -- was of course quite
cramped. In addition, we only had two hours a day where we could go out and buy food. And
the two hours were in the afternoon where normally there were no food in the shops anymore.

>> Bill Benson: Because it had all been sold out.

>> George Pick: Because it's all sold out. And in addition to that, many of the
shopkeepers would refuse to sell food to Jews. So it was a very, very, very precarious
situation.

>> Bill Benson: And at that same time, and once the Germans occupied and began the
deportations, then the allies began major bombing of Budapest, right?

>> George Pick: Right. Well, wnat happened, of course if anybody recalls the history, on

https://collections.ushmm.org

June 6, 1944, D-Day happened. And we were concentrated in these Jewish houses about two
weeks later and so that by July, first part of July, the British and the Americans had air bases in
ltaly, in France, and other places where they already were on the continent. And from there
they had long distance bombers. So one thing which they did was on the 2nd of July, which
was only a week after we moved into this building, which was a -- what they called carpet
bombing. It was a thousand bombers came over to Budapest and they were indiscriminately
bombing the city. As a result about 30% of the city after three hours of bombing had been
became rubble.

>> Bill Benson: What was that like for you? | mean, you were a boy.

>> George Pick: Yeah. Well, it was a very traumatic event, of course. We had
every -- every building had a bomb cave. Of course when you start the bombing, electricity
goes away. So you are sitting in a very small place. | would say probably one quarter the size
of this -- of the auditorium.

>> Bill Benson: And underground.

Under -- well, halfway underground and you are hearing these whistles when you know
the bombs are coming. And then you hear these tremendous blows which is when they hit
something. And we had four bombs in this three hours which hit within 200 yards of our
building. And these buildings became rubble of course. Most people died there. And we, for
some reason or another, were not touched. But with that, | got such a trauma that for the next
six-odd years | could not sleep without a -- something on the top of my head. My mother was
trying to of course protect me and in Hungary they used to have these big pillows, these goose
feather pillows which would muffle the sound. So she always brought in a goose feather pillow
and | slept with my pillow on my head until late â€˜50s. And even today | am using earplugs
because | can't take noise, particularly unexpected noise. So that was -- that was happening.

>> Bill Benson: George, you told me that it got to a point where, because you were
allowed out for two hours, you also emerged, tried -- based on the timing of the bombing,
because the allies would bomb -- the Americans and British would bomb at one part of the day,
the Russians would bomb at another. So you had that little window to get out.

>> George Pick: Exactly. Now, | should mention that the way this whole thing was
enforced, this window was enforced was by a Christian family by the name of Varger. And he
was a -- the sub -- how do you --

>> Bill Benson: Superintendent.

>> George Pick: Superintendent, right. The super of the building. Now, he was the super
of the building for quite a long time. And my relatives lived there for a long time. So they were
friends. And Varger was a very humane and very decent man. So he had helped us as much
as he could. But his business was to close the doors and lock it from the inside.

Now, this went on throughout the summer and sometime in August my father's unit was
brought back to Budapest and that was good news for us. My father risked his life but every
other day he was able to come home illegally at night, late at night, after midnight. And then he
knocked on the door and Varger opened the door

>> Bill Benson: Let him in.

>> George Pick: Let him in, and then he was with us for a couple of hours and then he
went back. This happened quite -- relatively often.

So we thought that more or less everybody by then knew that the Russians were already
fighting in Hungary, in the Hungarian area, and we didn't think that it was going to last very
long.

And then in October 15 the -- Horthy was the regent, decided to make a proclamation on
the radio that Hungary is now -- not switched sides but being neutral. They are not going to
fight the Russians, they are not going to fight the Germans. Now, he was a little too little and
too late. In August the Romanians already switched, who were behind news the east. And
they help the Germans and now the full Romanian Army was fighting on the side of the Soviets.
So the declaration of neutrality was nothing. And it was so much nothing that the loyalty of the
Hungarian Army was not with the regent. So after two hours of fighting in the -- well, the regent
was -- he and his family were arrested and a new very -- the --

>> Bill Benson: The Arrow Cross.

>> George Pick: The Arrow Cross government took over and then --

>> Bill Benson: And these are fanatical fascists and now they --

>> George Pick: They are fanatical fascists and they can care less about anything. They
want to kill Jews as much as the rest of the SS. So Eichmann, who was -- who left Budapest
after July when the deportation started, | should say on the 7th of July the regent all the
deportation stopped. By then there were no Jews in the provinces, only Jewish community was
in Budapest. So he came back on the 17th or 18th of October and he and all of his Hungarian
followers wanted to start deportations of the Budapest Jews. And in fact, within one week,
10,000 young women were deported. Among them, several of my aunts and cousins.

>> Bill Benson: And to reiterate a point you made, George, this is October 1944.
Russians are really literally on the outskirts, the allies are sweeping through Europe, the war is
essentially over, and here's this concentrated effort again to exterminate the Jews of Hungary.

>> George Pick: Budapest.

>> Bill Benson: Budapest.

>> George Pick: Right. Yes. Precisely. | mean, it is -- it's irrational, it's completely
insane. You know, when everybody -- well, they were pushed from every direction. They still
had this -- this thing.

>> Bill Benson: So that meant now you're going to get -- as part of this effort you're now
going to be forced into a ghetto. So what happened?

>> George Pick: Well, as a part of this effort, one of the things which happened was they
did not have any transportation. So as they started to deport the Jews of Budapest, they were
forced to walk.

>> Bill Benson: Because the trains were bombed and weren't running.

>> George Pick: There were no trains anymore.

>> Bill Benson: No trains left.

>> George Pick: And so they were forced to walk. And 50% of them never made it to the
border. And so 30 or 40,000 Jews were killed that way. And my father came home at the very
end of October stating that he got 24-hour furlough but the next morning he was going to be
deported, just like | mentioned before. And my father had no -- he didn't want to do that. His
commander was a Christian man, of course, but he had a Jewish fiancÃ© who lived in our
building and he gave everybody a furlough, saying, you know, boys, next morning we are going
to get together in the railroad station and you are going to go to Germany. So my father of
course didn't want to do that, and he was desperately trying to find a place to hide. And he
went to a friend of his who was a Christian businessman and he said, look, | need -- | need a
place to hide. And this guy was not very surprised. He gave him a piece of paper, told him to
go to this particular address and see what happens.

So he went there. He was not far from this office, and it was a small factory. And it was

saying that it was a -- an Army uniform factory. And there was an Army man in front and he told
this Army man to let him in and want to talk to the commanding officer. And he let him in and it
turned out that it was really a camouflaged -- place camouflaged as a factory but in fact it was a
place of about 60 to 70 Jewish laborers who were --

>> Bill Benson: Were posing as workers making uniforms for the fascists.

>> George Pick: Correct, for -- if you went in you would see people working on uniforms.
But all those people were people like my father who did not want to get deported.

>> Bill Benson: A complete ruse.

>> George Pick: A complete ruse, yes. And it was a first -- it was a high priority place.
SO my -- we didn't know where my father was for about ten days. And then my father sent in
a -- an armed soldier and sent a note that we should go with him. The soldier and no --

>> Bill Benson: And the soldiers are part of the ruse.

>> George Pick: Yeah, the soldier was also a defector. He was also a soldier but he
defected. So we went and we found out -- my mother was very, very ambiguous about it
because her mother and her aunts were there. It turns out that it could not have been more
than the last minute because very few hours later the house was raided and all the people who
were there were taken to a -- a factory. From there they would be deported. And this was my
grandmother and her two sisters. And Mr. Varger who knew the family immediately called my
mother's uncle who was already in what they call a protected building, Swedish protected
building. If you go up to the second floor you find a picture of Raoul Wallenberg. Raoul
Wallenberg is a hero of the Hungarian Jews because he was able to have another ruse giving
people -- people papers which said that they were Swedish citizens and during the war they
would be protected by the Swedish embassy. Of course it was a bluff, but the Nazis bought it
for a while. And my mother's uncle was in one of these buildings. Varger called him. He called
the Wallenberg office and they brought in my grandmother and her two sisters. So they
essentially could thank Varger for their lives.

And meanwhile we were in this place, this factory with 170 people. By then everybody
brought in their family and children, and again, this place was not very large and it was
overcrowded and they had all these three -- | mean people slept everywhere, where they could

>> Bill Benson: So on the upper floor, somebody would walk in the street they'd see the
workers and there's the families underneath in various places.

>> George Pick: Yeah, sort of, yeah. And underneath they had this big text tile machines
and so relatively easy to -- to live there. And of course, afterwards | was thinking it would have
been a tremendous problem to feed these people.

>> Bill Benson: Right.

>> George Pick: | mean, 140 people. Not only that, but there were four of these kind of
factories. Altogether about 1,200 people, and it was the brainchild of a man by the name of
Kormos. His name was Kohn but his known (inaudible) was Kormos. And it was not just one
man. It was a number of Christians and Jews and they worked together.

>> Bill Benson: To have four of these factories.

>> George Pick: Yeah, communists, everybody. It was probably the largest action like
this resistance trying to save people there. And everything went okay until the 2nd of
December when we had the raid. And the raid was because Kormos was betrayed. It's a
complicated story. | wrote it up and it's published, but they looked at -- they only knew three of
the four places. And Kormos was in the place where we were. He moved around, every night
he slept somewhere else. And they came in, five of them with machine guns, and sorted out

men and women and children on the other side and, you know, against the wall and were told
that would be it. But fortunately this was in December and the Russians were about 20 miles
from Budapest. So these Hungarian Gestapo men were not quite as crazy as most of these
fanatics and they were able to -- or we were able to bribe them. So they got a lot of diamonds
and dollars and whatever and they left and they said well, you are under our protection now.
And nothing happened until about a week and a half later where two policemen came and these
two policemen told us that we are going to be taken to the ghetto. Now, before this happened,
the little group of leaders in our 170, group of 170, decided that the 22 children are not very
safe in this hiding place but they would be safe in a Swiss Red Cross orphanage. And of
course it was myself and 21 others. And so they -- we went there and there were 500 children,
30 -- in terrible conditions. 35 in a room, it was just a little part of a building, and | was walking
around and looking for people who | knew but nobody was there. And | decided and another
friend who was my age, we were ten, decided that we could not stay there. We want to elope,
get out.

So in the next morning we asked the lady -- the building was of course locked from the
outside. We asked the lady to take us out so we could buy some food for ourselves. And this
lady took us out and we ran away. And we ran back to where my parents were and his parents
were. It turned out that about five days later the orphanage was taken to the Danube and the
kids were shot into the Danube

>> Bill Benson: All 500 kids.

>> George Pick: All 500 kids, yeah. So if you remember the last picture you only saw two
child -- children. One was me and the other one was the other kid. And out of the 20 --

>> Bill Benson: You were the only two that survived.

>> George Pick: We were the only two that survived from our group.

>> Bill Benson: George, and we're getting very short on time, but | really -- we need you
to tell wnat happened next.

>> George Pick: Well what happened next was they took us to the ghetto. Out of 170
only 65 went to the ghetto and we and we lived in horrible circumstances. We had a -- an old
age home in the building and the people were dying by --

>> Bill Benson: And again, the importance here is that you're forced into a ghetto. Now
it's late December and there's still this attempt to force you into smaller quarters.

>> George Pick: Right.

>> Bill Benson: So that you can be deported or killed more easily. Here you are in this
compressed little area now.

>> George Pick: Right, there is a small area, 70,000 people there, and they knew that
they couldn't deport us so they had various plans to kill us. One plan was to blow up the ghetto.
Another plan was to bring in some SS and Hungarian Nazis to machine gun us. And fortunately
neither of these happened. But what happened is about half of the people in the building where
we were who were mostly old and sick died.

>> Bill Benson: Describe the circumstances in this building because now the siege of
Budapest is underway, the Russians have -- imposed a siege on the city, there's
bombardments going on.

>> George Pick: Correct. This building was a very old building. It had a basement which
had no floor. It was just dirt and we had to have the -- the latrine in the middle and 200 of us
were pushed in to less than half of the area which you have in here. And so we were very close
together. Food supply was non-existent because anybody who was moving on the street would

be shot by sharp shooters from the houses or airplane bombs, whatever.

My father was part of a very small group of the ghetto police whose business was to try to
save the Jews. Of course, he didn't have any arms for that. And he lost two of his partners.
But he himself was walking the streets and trying to make sure that no people died. But again,
because of the extended period of no food, thousands of people died of starvation. And we got
lice and everybody was very, very sick and finally on January 18 the noise of war sort of ceased
and it was quiet. And then we realized that we got freed. And we went back. My mother and
my father were so weak that the trip from where we were in the ghetto to our prior house, which
is normally was like 35, 40 minutes, would take four hours. And we had a small suitcase which
| was carrying which was carrying the family photos. My mother could care less about anything
else but she felt that the family photos were irreplaceable.

>> Bill Benson: Which is why you have some photos we used to start the program.

>> George Pick: Precisely. So and then we went home and my father was too much of
an optimist. He thought that we would be a democracy or Hungary will be a democracy and
that he could make a living there. Well, it turned out that he was too much of an optimist. The
Russians did not willingly go out. Instead they became a communist country with all the
political oppression, et cetera. And then in 1956, it was the only country in the Soviet bloc who
had a rebellion against it was Hungary. | was just finishing my studies as an engineer and |
joined the forces for those couple of weeks of fighting. And then | saw that there is just no way
that we -- that the Russians would leave and so | decided to leave myself.

>> Bill Benson: And | wish we had another hour to hear about your escape from Hungary,
making it to the United States and then beginning a tremendous career here in the United
States. George, thank you for this. We're going to close our program in just a couple of
moments. We don't have time for questions or it's just too much for George to share with us,
but when we finish, after George finishes, it's our tradition that our First Person has the last
word. So I'm going to turn back to George to close the program. But when he's done, he's
going to remain up here on the stage, so we ask that if any of you want to ask him a question,
come up and just shake his hand, get your picture taken with him, he'll be here to do that. So
we would appreciate it if you would take advantage of that, if you don't mind. Just to remind
you, we'll have a First Person program each Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of
August. So we invite you back, if you can come this year or look for our program next year.

With that, I'm going to turn back to George to close today's program. Thank you for being
with us, and George, thank you. So --

>> George Pick: Yes, thank you for the last word. In the past | had stated often that we
should be tolerant and accept each other's religious cultural differences. Now | say that
tolerance and acceptance is not enough. We must be proactive and fight vigorously against
anti-semitism, racism, and all types of hatred in this country and everywhere else in the world.
In many places in the world this hearing aid tread turns into violence, as you know very well
from your newspapers, massacres, wars and genocide. We must not ignore this and let our
leaders know that they must not ignore this either and that we need to do something to stop the
violence and what is going on. It's unacceptable completely. And that's my last word.

(Applause)
