books in Lithuanian, across the border in Prussia, and smuggle them into
Lithuania. And that’s how they had books, Lithuanian books in their villages.
Q: I see.
A: And you could be punished very severely by the tsar’s agents if they found out
that you had Lithuanian books. But — so, there was this feeling that now they cannot
tell us. We have our own books, our own government. I don’t think anybody was
too interested in how the government ran, or what was happening. They — their lives
concentrated on their farm, on their families, on the weather.
Q: Cause this — it affects the farm.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: That’s it. But, as I say, they would not have — they would never have welp —
welcomed any foreign country taking Lithuania over.
Q: Well, some people will call that patriotic, not necessarily nationalist. That
definition of it, that people find themselves to be patriots of their own country, and
willing to defend it.
A: Well, defend it — it’s interesting how it happened, from what I remember.

Q: Are we talking now about World War II, or World War I?
A: Two.
Q: Okay.
A: I-I in —1n 1918, Lithuania became separate. The Russian — the tsars were
defeated. The — now I’m talking because I learned about it, not because — 1t was
much discussed in my family, because that was way before.
Q: Got it.
A: Nobody would sit down and — we didn’t have TV or radios. We did have a radio.
Nobody listened to it so much, except operas. But what I learned later on, after the
communists took over Russia government, and then stopped a war, Lithuanians
declared independence.
Q: We’re talking 1917 - 1918.
A: 1917-1918.

she found out he was cheating on her. Again, my mother tells the story. And so, she
got mad at him and married my father, to spite him.
Q: So your father was a — a rebound?
A: He was a rebound, and it was not a happy marriage.
Q: Oh.
A: It was not a happy marriage.
Q: In what ways?
A: Well, my mother felt that my fath-father never accomplished much, that he was
not ambitious enough, that he was sort of happy-go-lucky person, and that she made
a mistake marrying him.
Q: Did you children used to hear that?

to her friends about it. And — sometimes — and — and that’s how I heard about it.
Q: Did they argue?
A: Yes, they argued. What did they argue about? Money. I think my father probably
had a relationship with somebody, and my mother just simply did not have much
respect for my father.
Q: Ooh.
A: They just — it j — it just was not a happy couple.
Q: Where — was the atmosphere then, much different in your home —
A: It was not happy atmosphere in my house, no.
Q: Yeah. But it — so it’s a big contrast to when you would go spend the summer in
your grandmother and uncle’s —
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: They do not abuse each other openly, or in front of us, and was not much
arguing. But they just was — I think in some ways, my father loved my mother, but
he just never measured up to her expectations.

what she expected of him.
Q: That’s pretty harsh.
A: Yeah.
Q: That’s pretty harsh.
A: Yeah. So it was not — it was not a happy marriage. And they were both very
caring, as far as we were concerned, the children. But —
Q: Were you closer to one, or to the other?
A: I think as a little girl, I probably leaned more — more towards my mother, but not
really, because they were wise enough to never, in front of us, bring their troubles,
bring their dis-disputes, and try to tell us, oh, he is not good, or she is not good.
Q: Okay.
A: They never did that.
Q: Okay. So it would be what you had overheard, and just the general sense —
A: That’s what I were — that’s what I overhear, that he is not ambitious enough, that
he is not really supporting his family the way he should, that he is not working hard
enough. Mostly that was coming from my mother. I never, ever heard my father
talking against my mother, never.

A: Well, my father was much more open and loving and fun, where I don’t

as good as possible. When you see that photograph, we are wearing beautiful, red
velvet outfits, with my brother. I remember the — they would — expected me to do
well in school, when I started going to school. But I would say my mother was not
very affectionate, whereas my father was. My — my father would not — would — was

of the — of that town, there was a square where the — they would hold market days.
They would have a market day, and the farmers from the area would come and sell
eggs, they sometimes had animals to sell to other farmers, even horses. And they
would sell all kinds of farm produce, garden stuff. And on that square — I mean, on
that open place, there was a Jewish bakery at one — on one side, I remember, and on
the other side, on the corner was the library. Steps in, one story. My mother’s desk
there, and bookcases in the — in the room. I don’t think there was a — there were —

buy a sweet.
Q: Oh. What ki — do you had — did you have a favorite sweet?
A: I know exactly what kind of a sweet. It’s a — made from what we call now
gingerbre — bread. But it was made in a shape of a mushroom, and it had icing on
top. And that’s what I will get. That was my sweet. And it was — you know, it was
very eas — easy life. There was no other buildings in town that I remember, down,

doll that had eyes that closed up. And I never had anything like that, so I was very
jealous. I was very jealous of my sister to begin with.

communism, and how the common man was — there were — there were probably
some people in town who liked the idea that 1t was — everybody’s going to be equal
type of a thing, but I don’t know. I do know that the farmers were very concerned,
because they were required by the gub — by the government now, to deliver so much
food, grains of all kinds, maybe even animals to their government. For which they
got paid, but very little. So slowly — you know, depending how much land you had,
it looked like slowly you will have to sell it — to leave it, because you will not able
to — to have enough to deliver to the government. And after that, they would start
building kolhauses(ph). Kolhauses(ph) is a farm that the land belongs to the state,
and everybody works there, for the state. So that was going along, and — but as far

disappeared again. And then just before the deport — huge deportation was staged,
he came home, and I have a feeling that the people knew, or sensed, or heard
something, that something is going to happen. So, my father or my mother, I’m not
sure who, got in touch with my — my uncles, and they came, and they picked us
three up.
Q: The children.

Let’s get rid of the Soviets. At least the Germans are religious. So that was it. So
when they took us to the farm, I did not think anything of it. Now, I tell you the one
thing. Once I — once we got there, after staying with my uncles for about a week, we
were taken away from my uncles, our uncles distributed the three of us to different
farmers around.
Q: Family members, or not?
A: No, not even family members. I don’t know where my brother was, or my sister.
I know that I was with some people who I could have met, but they were not family
members, and I just stayed there, and I did not know why. I thought maybe because
the war was coming, because at one point, the family had even a — a kind of earth
tunnel built, or something, that you could go in, if the bombs start falling, if they
start shooting around.
Q: Do you remember anything about this family that you were with?
A: No, don’t remember. I don’t even remember their name.
Q: Okay.
A: But, you know, they were kind to me, they were good to me. They did not — they

to the apartment. So, this is what my sisters told me, she said, when she got off —
out of the plane, we somehow, all of us recognized her. But we also knew that once
she was able to fly out of Russia, and fly to Switzerland, that when she got to
Switzerland, we knew she was safe. So that’s — what she told about the camps, she
said actually, first she was kept in prison, and was interrogated, and was badly
beaten up, and they wanted to get names of other partisans, partisans that were
involved. And she said she didn’t tell them anything. So she then ended in camps
way out the Altai mountains. And it was very difficult. She had had, at one point,
some training as a nurse. So for a while, she actually helped out in one camp, as a
nurse, and she caught TB. She almost died. And then they — they worked in the
fields, and she said sometimes the peasants from the area would leave packages of
food in the fields for them, for the prisoners, because they knew they were starving.
She said by that time, a cat appeared in the camp. We knew that we lived much
better, because nobody ate the cat.

All right. So, before the break, we were talking about what had happened your —
with your mother, what her destiny was, and one thing that I wanted to see if we
could bring some clarity to, would have been, what was the reason for her
deportation? Why would she have been taken? Can you supply any explanation for
that?
A: I do not have any specific informations. What I heard people talking about, that
there were more people — she was not the only one from the town that was taken,
there were more people taken from that town. I think the mayor of the town, and his
family. And 1-1f it — it’s strange — strange coincidence, one of the daughters, small
daughter of that family, was staying with her grandparents in the village, and she
was left.
Q: I see.
A: So everybody was taken in the family, but her. And she grew up and actually
came to United States. And from the people there was a feeling that they were
trying to pick up better educated people, and probably people that might have been
a problem. I had never heard anything said that my mother would have been picked
up because of my father. I haven’t heard that at all.

Q: Why would she then, have been picked up? If not because of your father, what
would be the — the reason?
A: But I think it’s nobody was given any reason. They just showed up and said you
are going, period. That is my understanding. There were all these people, they’re
taken from — from this town, and it was a massive deportation all across the
country. People were taken from other cities, too, and shipped straight out to — to —
to Soviet Union. And much later on, one of my uncles and his family were
deported. That was during the 40s.
Q: After the war?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: Yes. When the Russians stayed in Lithuania.
Q: Okay. So there was no — your mother had a feeling —
A: There was no — there was no specific charge. It was not like somebody showed
up and said okay, you’ve wrote this pamphlet, or your belong to this group, and
that’s why you will have to go.
Q: Okay.

people. Very often I heard those stories that they separated small children from their

to raise.
Q: Oh really?
A: I don’t know if that is true. I really don’t know. And as far as I was concerned,
the way I found out, I told you how I found out about it, nobody ever explained to
me why she was taken. He just said there were a pla — many other people taken.
Q: Do you remember missing her?
A: Oh, I miss her terribly. The — everybody — I mean, my sister was tiny still, she
was seven years — she’s seven years younger. So my sister, she said that — she told
me much later, now actually, that for a long time she thought maybe she did
something, that’s why the mother was gone.
Q: Yeah.
A: And it’s just one of these things that happened. And, in a strange way though,
now of course, I would question it — if anything that — like that would happen, or
similar, I would be questioning everywhere. But at that time I was small, the war
was going on, and nobody — and never asked any questions. I never asked any
questions, and nobody explained to me.

A: I was then not staying with my fa — with any of my family. We were separated,
the three children, and I was staying with some other people. And then eventually
heard that the Russians left, and the Germans came, and as far as I was concerned,
and the people around me were glad to see Germans, because the Russians were
beginning to confiscate the farms, and impose all kinds of restrictions like that. And
the times in the country became more difficult. So they thought well, occupation —

say — what — if you know Lithuanian history, that part of Lithuania, Vilnius and all
around there, at one point it was in Polish hands. After 1918, the Poles, they — they
were there, and the Lithuanians could not get the land back. So only when the — first
the Russians, the communists came to Lithuania, they brought this country, these
parts of Lithuania, back to the Lithuanian Republic then. And the Germans also
had it all in the Lithuanian Republic. Actually, when my father was working in
Sventéionys, we have gone to Vilnius, excuse me, to visit with some priest that my

A: You know, in — again, if I think about it now, it’s very unsettling. However, I
was small, I was still very young, and I wasn’t the only one who was being resettled
everywhere, up and down. It was — the whole country was being resettled up — up
and down. There — there was no — it was not unusual to have to move, and start
somewhere else, and I really didn’t have a place, some [indecipherable]. My
mother was taken, so in Jaimalas(ph) there was nothing for me, anybody else. And
— well, the farms, my uncles’ farms were okay, but I had to go to school, so I will
not have stayed in the village anyway. And I had never been there in winter, so — so
moving to another city, and a— another town, and another apartment wasn’t
something that was dra-dramatic for a — that si — the — the har — hurtful thing was
that my mother wasn’t there.

German occupation, education was severely restricted for Poles. Severely. In some
ways, outride forbidden.

Q: And some places, only up until certain grades. So maybe children went to school

Q: Okay.
A: Because my father was arrested. I was on the farms. I and my brother were on
the farms with our uncles, and my grandmother was in the apartment in
Sventéionys, and my uncles went and picked her up. I think also in that period, that
summer, at one point, before our uncles, before I went to our farms, we were taken
out of town. Now who took us, I don’t remember. And we were placed somewhere
in a very wooded place, somewhere in the woods, by some family, for a few weeks
or a month or so. I’m not sure how long. But then we all come together — I’m
talking children — and we all left for my uncles’ farms. And then, while there, at the
end of the summer, time came to go to school, and my uncles rented an apartment
for my aunt and the three of us in Kupishkis, so that we could go to school.
Q: So it was another new school?
A: That was another new school. And I haven’t lived in Kupishkis before. I didn’t

it. How, I don’t know. I remember thinking that it was so unfair. The Russians took
my mother, and the Germans put my father in jail. And the school started, we
moved to shi — to Kupishkis, and there was a break in the fall, there was some kind
of a holiday, and my aunt was ready to go to Vilnius, visit her father, and I was
going to go with her. And just before we left, we received information that he was
released.

was left for the Poles. But as soon as the first communist occupation took place, that
part of Lithuania was put back to Lithuania.

Polish population, but also a Jewish population before the war. When you went

any Jewish people? Do you remember seeing anything on the streets, anybody on

if they — I don’t remember seeing a synagogue. I did not remember hearing any
Jews in the stores. Just on di— didn’t see any Jews. No — no Jews ever came to our

not surprising because when I was in — in Sventionéliai, I did not know if there
were any Jewish children in my school.

they never tried to tell us anything about it — about the fate of the Jews, or did we
ask? Now, why didn’t we ask? Perhaps we were scared.
Q: Why would you be scared?
A: If people are being arrested, you are scared. If you are small, and people are
being arrested, especially if they were people that you knew — though I did not
know any Jews — I knew Jews in — in Jaimalas(ph), as store owners. But in
Sventionys, when we moved into Sventionys, I did not meet any Jews. And I —I
mean, I know what happened, but by the — when we arrived there, I would now
think that by then the Jews must have been rounded up and moved out of town.
Q: Okay.
A: Because I know that Germans required that they wear — wore a yellow star. Now
where did I find that out? Was it there, or much later? Probably still in Lithuania,
but I never saw anybody wearing it.

very much, at that time. That there was a — an incident where a German — two
Germans were in car, driving somewhere, not too far from Svenéionys somewhere.
And they had a translator, a woman. I assume she was a Lithuanian woman. And
she was connected with the partisans. We knew there were partisans in the woods.
And she asked the Germans to stop the car because she needed to go to the woods

to relieve herself. They stopped the car, and the partisans shot them. And then she
was arrested. The Germans picked her up, and I remember that there was — that
there were some German nat — Wehrmacht, with the brown shirts, had appeared in
town, ka — even were in our house, talking to — to my father, and I remember my
father making a remark to somebody that she would be better off dead. And I
remember then hearing something that people were — were shocked because of this.
I remember that they picked maybe that incident, or some other incident, the
Germans picked up some — a couple men that — they were not Jews, I think they
were Poles, maybe Lithuanians, and shot them on — they took them to Jewish
cemetery and shot them there, though they were not Jewish. And I remember I was
very — I was afraid. But then I don’t know where they were buried, or not buried, or
what — or what they were shot for, but I was afraid. And then the Germans kind of
disappeared again. There was not — I did not feel a strong German presence in this —
in Svenéionys, because if you walked to school, if you walked to town, you didn’t
see them.

I mean, just the fact that my father was then arrested —
Q: Did you ever find out what for?
A: No. One did not ask. I mean, these things were — people were arrested. So, the
government, whoever they are at that point, has something against you, so they
arrested you. Why? Who knows? The whole system of justice was non-existent. It
was on on the whim of the government that was, at that time, 1n power. That’s it.
They did not have to give any excuses or explanations. You could have been picked
up walking down the street, and hauled off.
Q: Mm-hm. So —
A: Because it happened. Look, when my mother was taken away, there were
thousands of people taken away. So —
Q: So it wouldn’t have occurred to ask why. Is that what you’re saying?
A: No. Didn’t even occur to ask me why.

time, had I even known about it, that they were being arrested and hauled off, it

would be just another thing happening. Can you — another crazy thing happening.
Scary. It’s a very hard life. Very difficult time. It’s interesting when I think about it,
heck, here Iam. Wonder of wonders. I don’t even lock my door. I did for a long
time, in my life. I did not feel safe. And then, you know, then we — we were in DP
camps.
Q: We’ll talk about this.
A: Yeah.
Q: But I want to — I want to still stay with this [indecipherable]
A: Stay with th — with this — with this period in our life.
Q: Yeah. Now, at this point, Ill interject this — how it even is that we come to speak
with you today. And that’s by mentioning the book that your daughter wrote, your
daughter Rita Gabis wrote a book that was published two, three months ago, called
“Guest at the Shooter’s Banquet.” And in it she describes her journey to find out
more about what your father’s role had been during World War II. In a way, to find
out who he was. More of who he was. And I’ve read the book, and in it I also read
that you did not want to know until it was finished. You were going to read it, but
not until it was finished, as to what her progress was. Have I — am I accurate in
saying that, or were you involved in her research work?
A: About what, the book?

Q: About the book, about what she was doing, about her —
A: No, I was not at all involved.
Q: Okay.
A: No. The only — she came here once, with her husband, and my sister was here,
and we had one conversation where I think she wa — she was in the process of
getting the book going. About our life in Svenéionys, and what do we remember of
the war, and that period. And she did not feel that we gave her a very satisfactory
answers, that we knew enough about it. And it’s true, you know. When you think of
this — if this — something like that started happening here, you would be up in arms.
But I was this young child, the country was up and down, first one invasion, then
the other invasion. There was no stable government of any sort. Nobody even
taught us about any government, stable or otherwise. So you just kind of stay with
your family, and mind your business, and you don’t need to ask any questions. The
rest was not up to us. The only thing I can say is, what you hear, what you
overheard.
Q: Now, since then — you’ve read the book, is that correct?
A: Yes.
Q: What is it that you learned, that you didn’t know before?

A: I thought she did a very good job writing the book. I thought she — not only she
wrote a beautiful book — she’s a very good writer — but also, she did as much
research as was needed, and she wrote about things that I am — truly believe
happened.
Q: So — and these things involve some very bitter and very tough —
A: Yeah.
Q: — and one could say brutal —
A: Yeah.
Q: — events.
A: And I can under — I expect her — I won’t say interpretation, because it’s not
interpretation, it’s a fact —
Q: Okay.
A: — that was going on. And now, knowing my father, as a grown person, though I
always have been his favorite child, and I love him dearly, I know that he was a
vain man. I don’t think he was a mean man, or a— a cruel man. But I think he was
vain, and I think he could have easily fallen into a place where he will do things to
promote himself. Now, how far he will go with that — as the book says, he went
pretty far. Just about as far as you can go. But then, none of that was ever discussed

chief of security would do, because I never heard of that title.
Q: Yeah.
A: Never met anybody who was a chief of police — of security police.
Q: But as — as Rita writes, it did involve sending out orders to round up Jews. It did
involve making sure they were brought to certain places.
A: And, you know, if I had stayed, let’s say, in Jaimalas(ph), where I knew that
Jews lived there, and where they lived, now, if th — I was — had I stayed there, and
know that they disappeared, I would have been more curious. Then I would have
known that something is happening, and what is happening.
Q: Someone was there, and now they’re gone.
A: Yeah, yeah, that they were arrested or taken away. The — the talk would be right
there about it. I was in — in a city and town that was larger. I had never been there. I
never knew there were any Jews there.
Q: And the only thing you see from your father is that sometimes he gets drunk, that
he didn’t before.
A: Yeah, but then that’s also — my father liked to drink now and then. He never was
the — a man who would sit down and get drunk by himself. But he would love — he
loved company, and he would go — they would go out and they would drink at

A: Mm-hm.

A: Mm-hm.
Q: — she interviewed some of the relatives of the Poles who were shot, as a reprisal
A: Mm-hm.
Q: — for the killing of these two Germans. Did she present to you a man who was a
stranger to you, as a father, or was it someone you knew, but you didn’t know these
things about him?
A: I obviously did not know what’s going on. I did not know what was going on
with the Jews, and I did not know what my father’s part was in it. After everything
was over, and I was learning history later on, and I was learning what happened,
and thinking of my father in his — his place there, I can easily understand that she
could — that that could have happened. It did not take me by oh no, my daddy would

the town hall and sign papers. I wanted to wear a white dress and things like that.

A: I think my father was a bit — kind of the — he would have loved to have me marry
a Lithuanian. I mean, that was his choice. If it was not Lithuanian, I don’t think he
cared.
Q: I see.
A: And Stanley had no religious traditions. His mother had no religious traditions,
and I did not have any Christian traditions beside — I did have a Christmas tree up,
but that was about it. And so, it did not even occur to me that there is something
strange that I marry a Jew.
Q: Did he — did you ever have any disagreements with your father because of it?
A: No, no.
Q: Okay.
A: He was very — as I say, he — he would have preferred me that I married a
Lithuanian. The language, the history, the traditions. That he was a Jew, and he was
not a Lithuanian. He was so American, that I knew more about Jewish customs than
he did, really. So, there was never any — neither at his mother’s house, or that
Stanley ever had any food restrictions, or — nothing.

during the war, with him, and what had —

Chicago. My sister moved to Chicago also. I had some Lithuanian friends. I was
going to — to a university there, and I was, for a while, very friendly with an Arab. I
almost married him.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: Yeah. So, it just didn’t —
Q: It was — it didn’t come up?
A: No.
Q: Is that what you’re saying? Okay. Well, there are a lot of people who have told
me, that after the war was over, they just didn’t talk about what they had gone
through. These are people who were also Jewish —
A: Well, you know —
Q: Yeah?
A: — you don’t really — it’s — it’s like — it’s not a happy time in your life. It’s such a
confusion, and it’s such an unsettled time. In my case, my mother was gone, my
very religious aunt was raising me, which I wasn’t so enthralled about. We were in
Sventionys, we had to leave there and hide. We — then my father was arrested. I

mean, it just one thing after another. And you somehow plowed through it all. Then
we left Lithuania in a hurry, hiding.
Q: Okay, let’s go back to that, because as I said, I jumped ahead.
A: Yeah.
Q: And I do want to go back to what life was like after Svenéionys, when your
father is released, and you all move to Panevézys. That’s 1943 — °44.
A: Okay.
Q: We’re coming to certainly, as far as the large picture is concerned, Germany is
now losing the war. The Battle of Stalingrad has happened. They have lost that
battle, they’re — you know, they’re pulling back. You’re in Panevézys. What did
your father do? What was his job there?
A: He was in Panevézys, I was not there.

A: My father had a job. I was never quite sure what kind of a job. I know he had an
office somewhere, and he had — he did not wear any uniforms, and he had a small
apartment in Panevézys. And I remember going over and spending a day or two
there. I had taken a train from Kupishkis to Panevézys and back, but he never told
me what he was doing. He was working for — for the — for something.
Q: But you don’t know whether was for the government, whether it had anything —
A: No, I didn’t know.
Q: — with police, or anything.
A: No, I wasn’t sure. I knew he was not working in a store, selling something. I
knew he’d have to do something more likely with the — maybe the police, maybe
the army, or government, maybe? Do not know. And meanwhile, in Kupishkis,
things were going on a very even keel. Nothing important was happening. It was
difficult, there were shortages. And I remember for some crazy reason, I wanted to
get a little goat. I set my heart on getting a little goat. So guess what? My
grandmother, or my aunt were able to get a pound of bacon. And for that pound of
bacon, I got myself a goat.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: I did. I would walk around the town with a goat.

somewhere in the west of Lithuania, not too far from the Baltic.
Q: So, near Klaipeda? Palanga?
A: It’s — no, no, it was farther south. Some little — actually, some farmers that had a
farm and had a house and had a place way in the woods, and my father was there,
and we stayed there for several months, I think. And I remember they — my father
would go hunting to get a deer, and my brother and I would go in the woods with
him, and we would — woods are separated in squares, I think. Anyway, there is a
path in between, and my brother would go in the woods, and would go, making a lot
of noise, to chase the deer out to — towards my father. And one day when we were
out there, we found this package dropped, like a fairly large thing, lying in the
woods.
Q: A package wrapped?
A: Which looked like it had a parachute on it. So we called my father, we picked
this thing up, brought it to the farm, and my father opened it up with the farmer.
There was a lot of money there. Deutschmarks.
Q: Really?
A: And apparently what it was, probably it was a drop for Russians partisans, that
must have been hiding in the woods. I was scared. I really was scared then, 1n that

really were right on our tails.
Q: Were there many people on the roads?
A: There were — after we crossed, there were a lot of people going. We had —
actually we had a bit of a problem crossing the bridge, because by then — we called
them the Brownshirts, who are crossing, and were pushing people away. But we

bridge up soon after we went across, to slow down the Russians.

the Russians — when the Russians — when the war is over, which he was certain it
will be over very soon, that we would not be in the Soviet zone, but in the American
zone. So we did. We went all the way to Bavaria.

So, we stayed there til the end of the war, and the way the end of the war came for

Interview with Danguolé Gabis m7
December 10, 2015
Q: Did your father, when you were an adult, ever tell you anything more about his
life, about his role, about what World War II was all about?
A: When — you — you mean when I was —
Q: When you were as grow — when you were grown up. When you were already
married, or so.
A: No.
Q: No.
A: Nobody told me anything.
Q: Okay.
A: I didn’t ask anything either.
Q: Okay. Did your children ask much about war, about what was going on? I mean,
Rita eventually does, because she writes the book. But before that —
A: No.
Q: — as they were growing up. No?
A: No. I mean, I knew what happened to the Jews in Lithuania, like what happened
to the Jews everywhere, in Germany, and — and in — in France. Everywhere there
was — the Germans went. I knew that. What my father’s role was in this, I had no
clue. I did not think he was working for th — for the — for the Germans. So — so

Saugumo policija, security police, well, I did not know that was the German
position. I hardly ever saw Germans around.
Q: Yeah.
A: I didn’t even see many Germans around in town. Very few. And when we got to
Germany — oh, I tell you one thing, that probably be interesting. When we first
moved to Germany and got to Germany, in the south, and we were there in the s —
first we were in mul — was it Mulba(ph)? We stayed in some little hotel. And we
had these [indecipherable] cards, and we could buy food in the restaurant there, but
they — all they served you, there was just watery soup basically, that’s it. And so my
brother and I, we take our marks, and would march out into the villages outside, and
we learned — we wanted to buy bread. We would say brot kaufen. Brot kaufen. It
was late fall, and I remembered the ground would be covered with beautiful pears
that just dropped off the trees. And the farmers will come out and bring big half
loafs of this beautiful bread, and sometimes even — even some smoked meat. And
we could take as many pears as we wanted, and we would want to pay with our
stupid marks, and they all said, no, no. They wouldn’t take any money from us. But
that was something that I learned, being in Germany.
Q: Why do you think that was? Why do you think they didn’t want to take money
from you?

Interview with Danguolé Gabis

A: I think they just saw two bedraggled —
Q: Children.
A: Yeah. Asking for bread. They did not know if we had deutschemarks, or did not
have, how much it was, what were they worth, if anything, by then. So —
Q: Mrs. Danga(ph), we’ve talked a lot today.
A: Yeah.
Q: We’ve covered a lot of territory.
A: Yeah.
Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add to what you’ve said?
A: That I would like to say? [technical interruption]
Q: I was asking, was there anything you would like to add?
A: Well — [phone ringing][break] It sounds — when I tell you that, 1t sounds — it’s
such a remarkable, big story. Actually, very ordinary. In the li — in the times that I
lived, it’s nothing unusual. In the places that I lived. In the places that I came from,
and the times that I lived. There are hundreds of s — of stories like mine. I don’t
know how it all ended up for them, but I think most of us ended up somewhere in
the west. And did good — had good lives. And for myself, when I think, I had a very
good life. I mean, I had some hardships, and so on. When you are young, things are
easy. Fortunately, I did not have any serious illnesses, and we were never wealthy,

but we were never poor-poor. And the fact that I cannot see that much now, but I
live here, and I have a great deal of help.
Q: And has this early — all these early years that are not filled with happy things,
and that — why would one want to remember and recall them, have they — did they
influence the rest of your life in any way?
A: Perhaps. I think all our past influence our presents, to some extent. I don’t think
of it. Now and then if I am — if I — my brother is dead now, but when my brother
was alive, we would remember. And now and then, when I’m with my sister, we
sometimes talk about things. But then again, there is a seven year difference. But
now and then we can speak about the time in Germany, and how it was. Or how it
was when we first came here, to United States. That was an interesting thing, too. I
mean, came here and no language. Gloria.
Q: Gloria, yeah.
A: And my sister went to high school here, she finished high school here. But I
don’t think of my life as something extraordinary, or something greatly difficult, or
tragic in any sense. It just what it was. I consider myself very lucky that I am here —
the heat is coming on — that I have this house, that I am able to take care of this
house. And that I know good people around me, and that Lithuania is free. I know
that they probably are fighting about the government all the time, but —

Interview with Danguolé Gabis
December 10, 2015
Q: Your children — your children are half-Jewish, as well as half Lithuanian. What
would you want them to carry away’?
A: It’s their choice. [indecipherable] is great friends now with a Jewish man, and I
think they will marry this spring, coming year. She changed her name to re — to
Rachel(ph), and I kind of think of her as Rachel(ph). She used to be dark — she had
dark, curly hair, and now it’s blonde and straight, very fashionable. She is nowhere
as curious or interested, or searching as Rita is. David is doing okay, he works for a
univers — Boston University. He’s saving his money so he could retire and come
live on the island.
Q: It’s a nice thought.
A: Yeah. And I really, in many things that happened to me, I could have ended, oh
God knows where.
Q: Yeah.
A: But there was a great deal of luck. I was able — we were able to get out of
Lithuania when we got out, and we were lucky enough to come to this country
when we did. I had a good marriage, and ending up on this island, in this house, is
not bad.
Q: Not bad at all, not bad at all. Well, Mrs. Danga(ph), Poina(ph) Danguolé Gabis,
thank you very much for sharing your story with us today.

this, this —
A: It is a picture of my father, but I really don’t remember him in this uniform. The
