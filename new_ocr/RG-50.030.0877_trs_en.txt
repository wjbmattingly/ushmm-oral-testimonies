May 10, 2016
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mrs. Herta Griffel Baitch, on May 10", 2016, at the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum facilities here in Washington, D.C. Thank you very, very
much Mrs. Baitch for agreeing to meet with us today, to share your story, your
experiences, and with that, to allow others to know about what those were, and how
that fit into the large mosaic and picture of the tragic time of the Holocaust. So we
are very grateful for that.
Answer: Well, I’m grateful to be able to tell what I can —
Q: Thank you.
A: — for you.
Q: We’re going to start at the very beginning. I’d like to find out as much as I can
about your prewar life. I know that in some cases, with some people, that can
present some challenges. The reason why we try to go in as much detail as we can,
is that we want to get a sense of the world that you were born into, the forces that
shaped you — the first initial ones, and get a picture of what this world was, before it
was lost. So, my very first question is, could you tell me the date of your birth?
A: March 10", 1933.
Q: And what was your name at birth?

A: Herta Griffel.
Q: And where were you born?
A: Vienna, Austria.
Q: Austria. What was your father’s name’?
A: My father was Wolf, and my mother was Berta.
Q: Mm-hm. And what was her maiden name?
A: Nagel.
Q: Nagel, okay.
A: N-a-g-e-l.
Q: Were they both from Vienna?
A: No, they were both from Krakow.
Q: I see.
A: And my father was living in Vienna, and as I understand it, my mother was
taken from her small town to Vienna to find a husband.
Q: Did she find him then?
A: She found him, yes.
Q: And so, if they were both from Krakow, did you have extended family in
Vienna, or was it just the — the three of you?

May 10", 2016
A: There was no other family, except for an aunt who was my mother’s sister-in-
law. In other words, she was married to my f — my mother’s brother.
Q: I see. Okay.
A: And her name was Lotte(ph).
Q: Lotte(ph).
A: Lotte(ph) Nagel.
Q: And, so you had an uncle as well, in Vienna, or just the aunt?
A: No, no, she was a widow.
Q: Oh, I see. Did they come from large families, your parents?
A: Yeah, I don’t know, I don’t think so.
Q: Okay.
A: I—I just have the sense that there were no large amount of relatives at all.
Q: Did you ever visit Krakow —
A: No. Now? Recently?
Q: — to visit the family?
A: No, no, never
Q: Never.
A: Never.

Q: So it must have been Polish?
A: It must have been, but —
Q: But you don’t know for sure.
A: — they didn’t have any papers.
Q: Okay.
A: They had no papers.
Q: I ask these questions because very often, that made a difference.
A: It did.
Q: Yeah.
A: As I—as I found out later.
Q: Yeah.
A: It did make a difference.
Q: And — and another interview that I’ve recently done, also illustrates — you know,
there are pieces of the puzzle that you don’t realize until somebody life story is put
out in front of you. It has to do with Poland having been — part of it having been
part of the Russian empire, part of it being sal — Austro-Hungarian, and part of it
having gone to Prussia since, you know, in the 19" century. So, when it became
Poland, many of the people who were part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, who
were born in Poland, then went to Vienna.

that.
Q: That’s okay.
A: She was — she is not from Krakow, she’s from Poland. And —
Q: But she is from Poland.
A: Yes.
Q: She is from this little town.
A: Yes. My father was born in Krakow, I’m s — I —I-
Q: That’s okay.
A: — made a mistake.
Q: That’s okay. Do you know anything about your grandparents lives?
A: None.
Q: Okay.
A: None.
Q: Do you think they are — okay?
A: I want to ask [break]

A: I didn’t know that my mother was born in this small town, until I got the paper
from Yad Vashem that she was taken to Maly Trostinec and died there.
Q: I see.
A: That had her city of birth on there. I thought she was from Krakow, but she was
from Madian(ph) Sredny(ph).
Q: And what year did you get this document from Yad Vashem’?
A: It must have been about 12 years ago.
Q: So that would mean 2004 —
A: Approximately.
Q: — which 1s 50 — over 50 years — at that point 60 years —
A: Yes.
Q: — from the end of the war, which, you know, such a— such a small detail, but it’s
an important detail when you don’t know it.
A: I never knew that. I never knew that.
Q: Yeah.
A: We looked it up, and it’s a tiny little town, lots of farmland around it. So —
Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?
A: No, no. I was the only child. I was an only child, yeah, yeah.

Q: Okay. It’s — if someone were to ask me the questions that I am asking you, I’d
find them hard to answer, but I’m going to ask them anyway.
A: Okay.
Q: Can you tell me, in your — in your memory, what your earliest memory might be,
from childhood? What kind of image comes to your mind?
A: I— the image that — that I think of when I think of my childhood, is one of
secrecy, shushing, rumors, and sadness, and fear.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s — that’s the kind of overall feel that I have from my small years.
Q: How sad.
A: That — yes. Well, I didn’t — I didn’t know any different.
Q: Of course.
A: But I— I tried to make sense of it, but —
Q: But you know that a small child’s life is based on a feeling —
A: Yes, and that’s —
Q: — you know, is based on emotion.
A: — that’s — that’s what I remember. The only nice remembrance that I have, is of
singing Yiddish songs with my father.
Q: Really?

A: Yes.
Q: Did he have a nice voice?
A: I don’t remember his voice, but he loved to sing. So I — I even have that book
that my mother packed for me, with —
Q: Those songs?
A: — those songs, yes, she didn’t want me to forget them.
Q: And was there any one song in particular that he sang that you remember’?
A: Well, the one that I am most familiar with was “Oyfn Pripetshik.” So — “Oyfn
Pripetshik.”
Q: “Oyfn Pripetshik?”
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. Tell us what does that mean?
A: I think oyfn pripetshik means, o-on a fire of some side.
Q: Okay.
A: I really don’t — it’s fayerl, is a fayerl.
Q: Okay.
A: It’s — it’s in the words, oyfn pripetshik, brent a fayerl.

A: Yes, yes.
Q: That’s what stays.
A: And that’s the one that’s the most popular in this country, so —
Q: Can you — do you have any memory of your father as, you know, doing
something? Do you have memory of him working, do you have memory of him at
home?
A: I th—I don’t have a memory of my father in a grocery store. He was — he was
not a well person, and I wa — recognize that. And it was my mother that was a
strong — seemed to me the strong person at home.
Q: So let’s step back a little bit. Can you tell me that — one of the questions I usually
ask is, how did your parents support the family, that is, and you kind of answered it
now. So what was your father’s business? What did he do?
A: They had a small grocery.
Q: Was it a neighborhood grocery store?
A: I—I don’t know, but I had — I have a feeling that it was not too far away.
Q: Okay. And, did your mother work with him there?
A: Yes.
Q: All right. Do you have any memory of your neighborhood in Vienna?

May 10", 2016
A: No. I have very little memory of my childhood, of friends, of school.
Q: What about the place you lived, your —
A: That’s a question mark in my mind. My mother’s letters had an address that she
wrote letters to me from. But, in later years, we went to that address in Vienna, and
it did not seem like the same pla — I —I did not relate to it in any way.
Q: It might have been that she had to move.
A: Yes. Yes, I learned that, yes.
Q: Yeah. So —
A: And I don’t know what the address was on my records, because I had no — my
records were private with the agency.
Q: Okay.
A: So I never found out much information about where I lived, and so forth.
Q: So again, in your mind’s eye, you — do you have any image of a particular room
from your childhood, a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen?
A: No, I don’t.
Q: Okay. Do —
A: My -— my most vivid memory is of my mother and me going to the streets for a
parade. And it was an immense parade, and all the Nazi banners were — and
bunting, were all over the place. And I remember the sound of the boots of the

soldiers, and loud music, and a lot of sieg heils. And I didn’t know anything about
what was going on, and my mother just held — I remember her squeezing my hand,
and I said, what is this? And she said, it’s going to be very bad. That is the only
vivid memory that I have.
Q: Wow.
A: I remember the pounding on the pavement, on the street, and —
Q: What can you tell me about your mother? Is she someone who is more 1n your
memory than your father?
A: Yes, yes, but not as much as I would — I would think. Not as much as I would
think I— I would remember of my mother. She did embroidery, and she worked in
the store. And I think I was taken care of by another woman when she went to the
store. I don’t remember the store. I don’t — I don’t know whether I’m protecting
myself, or — I have no memories of hugging my mother, kissing my mother. I don’t
have those memories.
Q: Or of the reverse, of her kissing you and hugging you?
A: Yes, yes, I— I don’t — I don’t have those memories. I don’t have any memories
of my schooling, of friends. That’s — that’s been a blank. That’s bi — the whole —
that — until I came to the United States, and even for about a week or so, until I
went into my first foster home, that has all been a blank.

Q: And to this day?
A: And to this day, I don’t have a memory of being in my mother’s arms, and there
is one memory that I do remember. We were sitting in a chair at the end of Shabbat,
and waiting for the stars to come out. That is a memory. That’s a — that — that is a
good memory. And, we were waiting for the stars to come out, and my mother said
that there’s a moment just after Shabbat ends, and the stars come out, something
like that, she said, you can see God.
Q: Oh.
A: And I remember being in a chair with her. That — that — that’s about the closest
memory that I have. Even leaving, I — I remember that she told me I was coming to
the United States, and that another Jewish mother would take care of me, and — and
that I had to be very healthy. And these — these are the things that I — I remember
being in a shul. I think it was a shul, and people were crying, and she made me
leave. My father was holding a Torah, and I just assume now that that must have
been a Yizkor service, because people were crying, and she wanted me to leave.
Q: For those people, and myself included, who don’t know what a Yizkor service
is, could you tell us?
A: It’s usually on Yom Kippur, and it’s a — it’s a part of the service that remem —
where you remember your parents, and you say a memorial prayer for — for those

who’ve — you’ve left behind. And in the old days, they didn’t want children around.
And I—I remember my mother telling me to go outside. So I — I —I think those
three — three things. I don’t remember singing with my father, but I— I know I did. I
know I did, but I don’t remember it. The chair, sitting in the chair, watching the
stars, the me — the shul, and the parade. The parade is the most vivid —
Q: Vivid.
A: — thing that I have.
Q: Do you have any memory of their personalities?
A: No. I have a feeling that my father might have been more outgoing than my
mother. I think my mother was very quiet. I’m really not sure.
Q: So, I have a few questions that probably, if you know the answers they would
not be from memory, but from things you found out. But you can let me know. Do
you know what happened to your father, and to the grocery store, once there was an
anschluss of aus — of Austria to Germany, and the Nazis took control? How your
family was affected.
A: I understand. I don’t remember Kristallnacht.
Q: Okay.
A: But we did lose our grocery store.
Q: Okay.

A: And my father was taken by a truck to some sort of labor camp.
Q: Do you remember seeing a truck’?
A: There — there were trucks in the neighborhood that took men back and forth.
Q: Okay.
A: They came back at night, and they were rounded up in the morning. And this
went on for a time, and one night my father came home, and he died.
Q: At home?
A: At home, yes. He was not well to begin with, and —
Q: Do you remember anything about that?
A: We had a—I guess we had a funeral, we have — I remember being in the
cemetery, and I know my father had a grave. It was bigger than I was, and it was — I
remember it being green, and I remember my mother putting my — a hat — hat on
me, and she always tried to hide my — my braids. And I remember that I felt like a
boy when she did that. Also during the parade, she put a hat on me and stuck my
braids — I don’t know why, but I — I do remember that we — that she seemed to be
protected of — protective of my long braids that I had. So —
Q: Okay. Any — are there any feelings that you associate, any emotions? I mean,
there are the ones that we would normally think when a child loses a parent.
A: I don’t have that —

Q: Okay.
A: — emotional knowledge. I — I just have these — these memories of school, of
friends, of neighbors. I don’t —
Q: Okay. Okay.
A: I just — thinking I do remember that he had a large gravestone. I don’t know how
my mother arranged it, but she did.
Q: Do you remember ever feeling hungry?
A: No. No.
Q: Okay. So even when the store was lost, you don’t remember hunger, as a result
of that?
A: I think — I think — I think my mother came home with some sort of a pot. And
now that I’m older, I would assume that it was — could it have been through — from
a — some sort of a soup kitchen? I remember her coming home with a — a pot.
Q: Okay.
A: So I guess I have more memories than I think I do.
Q: Well —
A: I just don’t have the emotional memories at all.

Q: Yeah. We often find, you know, when we start an interview, and we start a
process that — one thought comes up, and it triggers another thought, and it triggers
a third thought —
A: Yes, yes.
Q: — and so on. And so —
A: Because I don’t — I don’t speak about this very —
Q: Of course.
A: — very often.
Q: Of course.
A: So -
Q: So it’s not surprising.
A: —I do remember her coming home with a — it had sort of a pot with a — a tight lid
on it. And at that time, after my — after we lost the store, we went to live with my
Tante Lotte(ph), who was my mother’s sister-in-law.
Q: So this is very interesting, you just anticipated the next question I was going to
ask. Because it sounds — the picture I’m getting, first of all, is, from what you tell
me, is vague. You know, it’s sort of like through a mist.
A: Yes.

feature your mother and your father and yourself, and nobody else by name.
A: No.
Q: Not even the lady who takes care of you.
A: No.
Q: And so then I wanted to ask about, how do you know Tante Lotte(ph)? How —
how does she figure in the story?
A: We went to live with her.
Q: Okay.
A: And then it was the three of us. It must have been an apartment. And I remember
one night we heard people with boots, and they came into our apartment. I think it
wasn’t the first apartment they wer — we — we heard it, we heard it. And they came
in the apartment, and they were shouting and — and they were looking at things and
throwing things around. I don’t know what they were looking for.
Q: Were — were there me — were these men?
A: These were Nazis, and they were in uniform, with beautiful, black high boots,
and hats, and — so that they were not the — the Brownshirts that we saw in the
parade, they were much more well-dressed. And there were two or three of them, I
don’t remember. And after they looked to see what they needed to see, we were sort

of cowering in the cent — in the c — 1n the corner. And when they left, my mother
went to this little stove, it had a little ashtray in it, for ashes from the woodstove,
and she had put some — some dol — some money in there, wrapped — wrapped
around into a tight bundle.
Q: Like in a cloth, or something?
A: I don’t know —
Q: Okay.
A: — but she — I remember her looking in this little drawer, and the money was
there, they didn’t find it. And I remember us being very happy at that time.
Q: Relieved.
A: Relieved, yes.
Q: Relieved, yeah.
A: And it was shortly after that, that my mother tried to find a way to get me out.
Q: Do you have any memories of Tante Lotte(ph), what she looked like?
A: Only from her picture. She — I don’t remember her much at all. I don’t remember
her much, just from —
Q: Was she much older than your mother?
A: She was older, that I know. She was — she was — she was older.

Q: But is your knowledge of how they looked, from the photographs, or from
something else in your mind’s eye? Or is it even possible to tell?
A: M-My — yes, my — Tante Lotte(ph) looks like herself. My father, I remember
him looking like that, and my mother, yes.

Q: Okay. So it’s not like you look at the — the photographs, and you say, I guess
these must have been my parents. You recognize them.

A: I always had those with me, and —
Q: Is there anything that you remember your father ever saying, that was like a—a
special saying he had, like you said your mother did, when you know, you find the
stars come out, and if you look very carefully, there you might see God. Did you

good. And when I came to the United States and was put into a classroom, the

A: No, it was a passport, but it had something else written on it.
Q: Yeah.
A: Can’t remember.
Q: That’s okay. That’s okay. Those are things that we can find out about by looking
at the document. What is — what — what we’re doing now is — is seeing what — what
was taken from you, basically, and how much of this world that you were born into,
you still were able to retain, and how much was lost. And so, that’s part of the story.
A: I think the emotional part was lost. Any kind of — I don’t have any emotional
feeling about seeing my father’s gravestone, or — I ha — the parade was — is most abi
— the most vivid memory that I have, and the second one was looking for the stars.
Q: Well, the interesting thing is also, when we started talking, you said that the very
first memory is an overall one of fear, of shushing, of you know, some secrets of
some kind.
A: It was not a happy — it was a very unhappy, not nice —

A: With the — I thought they were officers.
Q: Yeah. Nazis, I guess. And your mother says okay, now she’s going to look for a
way for you to get out. What is the next thing that you remember’?
A: I remember her telling me that I was going to America, and that another Jewish
mother would take care of me.
Q: And do you have any feeling from that?
A: I didn’t understand it. I don’t think I understood it.
Q: Okay.
A: But I remember her saying it, and also that I had to be very healthy.

children that got on the train. Maybe they were hoping that their children would, at
the last minute, be able to come. But that — that’s the sense that I had.
Q: So you —
A: Because there were a lot of people there, more than just the mothers of the
children that left. And it — I understand that the children were chosen because we

they gave me the letter, and evidently, my mother had packed a package and sent it
to her. I don’t know how it got out of Vienna, I think a non-Jewish person must
have sent the package to a non-Jewish person that my aunt — my cousin lived with. I
think she was a domestic. She — she came to London from the — in— ona
Kindertransport, and she worked as a domestic.
Q: This cousin?

those letters, when I was at the first foster home. I never got the letters, they were
returned to her, and she couldn’t reach my mother by then, and she assumed that I
never made it. And she had this package that she just kept. And we did meet her
around 1964 or 60 — ’64. And she had this package that had not been opened all
those years. She says she prayed that someday she would find me.

A: This is the lady, her name was Adela(ph) Dulah(ph), and she lived in London,
and she went to Israel to see relatives, and their bus broke down, and they were in a
gas station of some sort, with other passengers. And she started talking to a woman
from the United States, and she said, I always hoped that I would find a — my — my
cousin’s child, Herta. And she was saying this to this woman that she was sitting
with, and this woman was from Detroit, or something like that. And she said she
had just been to Baltimore, and she had seen a newspaper article, and she

they have her address. And so she contacted HIAS in Baltimore. And that’s how I
found her, she found me.
Q: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
A: It was an amazing, amazing story.
Q: What was in the package?
A: We — my husband and I went to her house, and she li-lived in a very small house,
and we sat in her kitchen. There was one light hanging from the ceiling, and some
sort of a stove. And she showed me the box, and when we opened it, it had a
tablecloth that my mother had, she said, never finished. My — my cousin said my
mother said it was never finished. And it had silver candlesticks, that she said were
obviously from my grandmother. And it had some spoons in it, and some knives
and forks. And it had some earrings that she thought were not good. She thought
that they were paste. And what else did it have in it? It had — that’s base — it had —
oh, it had my mother’s rings that she wore, and her — the earrings, I remembered her

Q: And now I want to turn, briefly, this part of our interview over to my colleague
Anatol Steck, because he has something else that he’d like to share with you, that
we think is relevant to your story, that he found just a little while ago.
Q2: The museum recently acquired the research collection of Leonard and Edith
Ehrlich, two survivors from Vienna, who spend a good 40 years researching the
history of the Jewish community Vienna during the Holocaust. And having
emigrated to the United States, they spent many years interviewing survivors from
Vienna who were in the United States. And those survivors, and these interviews
were done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often
individuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community
Vienna. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes,

which the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of
the cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one
interview that was conducted in December 27", 1974, in New York, in the office of
the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with
Margaret Feiler, the name who — who you will recognize. She is the only adult
chaperone who was on your transport. And the interview is, all in all, it’s about
three hours long, and — and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish
community. And at one point in the interview, she starts to mention an American
committee for children, which arranged for originally 30 children to be brought to
the United States, and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the
transport.
A: Oh my God.
Q2: And that is the ex — the excerpt that we would like to play for you now. It’s
about nine minutes long. [technical problem]

something on file on this. Probably not on this file, but she has the file. Children

whose fathers had died in some concentration camp, either Buchenwald or
Dachau, and whose mother had a quota which didn’t come up; Hungarian or
Romanian or Polish. Such children — they made a group of such children, of 30-odd
children, and they arranged for foster parents, here in the United States. The
community intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to
emigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States.
They all required for visa around August — September. And of the children, only
nine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social
workers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in
September, I don’t know how far back, but not in August, not in September, and not
before I got my visa. Now, I started talking to anybo — I [indecipherable] when I got
the visa, they asked me whether I would take those nine children, and that’s what I
did. And that’s how JDC even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid
for those nine children’s fare, and my own, and we came here. I went via Berlin,
where I picked up the 10" child, that also wasn’t [indecipherable] and I brought
them to the United States, via Lisbon. It was the first transport via Lisbon, through
occupied France [indecipherable]. Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the
people who had gone to the consulate, two social workers, and everybody else to
whom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order to

communicate to their relatives here that they couldn’t come because they didn’t get
the vi — the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked
questions. And there was one thing that they all had in common, all of them. There
must have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last
election, in the last free election that Austria had, which was some time in spring —
I don’t know when it was. The last thing — I asked that question, how —
I: Is that before or — before —
M: Before Hitler.
I: 1934?
M: Right.
I; There was not election —
M: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to —
I: Was there election between ’34 and ’38?
M: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was [indecipherable] But they have asked them — I can’t
re —I can't really tell you what year it was, because I know only the question. But
they asked, how did you vote during the last three elections? And all of them, every
one of them had said, either a social democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there
was no other party. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few
who had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of them had gotten a

visa. And the other questions, I didn’t find any other question that could be
[indecipherable]. So I started thinking. And I was asked the same question. Well, I
didn’t know what [indecipherable], but there was a so-called democratic
[indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of — of Vienna. Well, it was a
hopeless affair. It was somebody who really — I can’t — I can’t think why anybody
would spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don’t ask me
whether I quor — voted for that, because I won’t admit anything. But when I was
asked, that’s what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa.
I: [inaudible]
M: That’s — that was my [indecipherable]. So anyway, I got the visa, and when I
came for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the
second point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to
say, they asked me two questions. One said — one question was, what is your true
hair color — implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in
what month are you [indecipherable]
I; It was what?
M: In what month are you [indecipherable]. These were the two questions. So —I
mean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got
the visa in October, I got the — I left on November 30", I brought the children out.

There are some —I don’t think it’s here on file, and I don’t think I have it. I had
written a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was
called in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was
very interesting for the people [inaudible]. So that was the story of, in those days, of
the immigration. Now, of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing.
Murmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he
also [indecipherable]. And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from
the United States. And he was afraid — first of all, he didn’t want to stay.
[indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn’t want to stay. Number
two, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the
Gestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was
always afraid for his life. He said he’s getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is
not going to survive. So when I went to the United States, I promised
[indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young, and that I would
talk to Rabbi Young, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi.
I: Who is Rabbi Young?
M: Rabbi Young is — has a— a community, a — a — a synagogue on the west side. I
can get you details from [indecipherable]. He is of German extraction. He’s not a
refugee, but he is — when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the first

thing I did — I —I don’t know whether it was the first week or the second week. But
you see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan — the end of January. So it
must — all this was the end — the last few days in December, the first two days in
January. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young. I was admitted to his study,
and I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about
Murmelstein. Don’t mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now,
wait a minute. I’ve been working with him. Don’t tell me, I know all about it. There
is not a thing I’m going to do, he should be happy his name isn’t mentioned in the
United States. And he practically threw me out, I mean it’s — he — he — he was polite
enough to say goodbye, but you know [indecipherable]. So I wrote it. I wrote to
Murmelstein about it, and this what I want to tell you, because you see, I don’t
know how Murmelstein behaved in Theresienstadt. I can imagine that all sorts of
things happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in Theresienstadt was quite
different from the atmosphere in Vienna, and I don’t know what people do to
survive [indecipherable]. All sorts of things can have happened. But I do know what
happened when I was still in Vienna, and I know that there was nothing that he did
[indecipherable] because I was [indecipherable] all night. I went home to have a
shower, you know, that was it. And nevertheless, that rumor had reached already
the United States, at that time. People there are convinced already ...”

I am assuming this is the first time you hear her voice in decades.
A: I knew nothing about her until I met Stella —
Q: Okay.
A: Buchenstein(ph), and she told me all about it. I remember a nice American lady
that took good care of us.

wonderful American lady.

Q: Another lady then.
A: She was the intake person for the children. She accepted us, and I’m — I’m
telling you this from Stella’s information that she gave me. When we got to united

it’s M. Marcusy(ph).

A: To another lady, and she was a social worker, in this temporary home that we
stayed until we were dispersed.
Q: Do you have any remembrance of how long you were in this temporary home?
A: I did not know anything, that I was even in the home. I didn’t remember that at
all. I only remember going to the foster home with Mrs. Beazer(ph), my social
worker. But when I read the transcript that I have, of her accepting us — it’s about a
one and a half page transcript — seems like she was the nice lady that I remember.
Q: Okay.
A: Because she was American, or —
Q: And is there something that you learned from this tape, this interview, thinking
that again, this took place over 40 years ago, this interview, in 1974. Is there
something that you hear that it’s new, that is, something you weren’t aware of?
A: She di — she only spoke very shortly about the children.

A: This is what I learned from Stella, that — that we were chosen, only nine
children, and that somehow Rabbi Murmelstein said to the community, we’ve got
to get these children out.
Q: And was Rabbi Murmelstein the head of the Viennese Jewish community? Was
A: As far as I know. There was a meeting of the Jewish community, and I — I’m
only telling you this because Stella told me.
Q: Okay.
A: That he — they have to get the children out, if they can.
Q: So he was involved in — in liberation.
A: He was involved in that.
Q: I see. I see. How did it — when you first heard that we had her voice on tape —
A: I—I-—I mean, she is such a — on the trip, according to Stella — I hate, you know,
I have to keep mentioning her name — she mentioned Margaret Feiler as such a
very uncaring woman, who was really not with us very much. It seemed that the
children were by themselves, and that the 15 — two 15 year olds sort of took upon
themselves to take care of — of us, while we were en route.
Q: Mm-hm. It’s interesting that — first of all, it’s interesting, and it’s not surprising
that people have different memories of a same event. Or, as in you have said over

and over again in your case, you don’t have a memory of it. And that — that how
Margaret Feiler, 35 years after she brings these children over, is remembering in
her own mind what are the things that were salient for her, as she’s telling the
Ehrlichs about how she leaves Vienna, how she answers a question that has
nothing to do with anything, you know, that is — deals with who did you vote for in
the last free elections, you know. And why that would be significant.
A: Is that what they asked people, to get a visa?
Q: That’s what she is saying, that the social workers —
A: Well, my mother was not an Austrian citizen, so this — this would have been a
moot point.
Q: Yeah. I— I don’t know, but it could be that she was referring to the people who
were supposed to accompany the children.
A: Yes, maybe so. Now, did she say there was more than one’?
Q: It made — it sounded like that, that others were supposed to come with more
children, but that they answered in the wrong way, and didn’t get a visa. She is
leaving it — this is her supposition.
A: Uh-huh.
Q: And she is leaving it up to the Ehrlichs to make of it what they will. The people
that she’s talking to.

experiences were. So the last we really left your story was when you are with your
social worker, Mrs. Beazer(ph), you said?

A: Yes.

it very strange, was it very different?

to light them too. So, there were three other children in the family; a baby, a very
young child, and — and Beverly, who was — I was seven, she was five — four or five.
And — probably five. And I lit the ca — helped light the candles, and I said the
brachah. Well that — they were so amazed, they were — and their reaction to me
was, where have you been all this time? It was very, very wonderful, and loving and
reassuring to me, because —
Q: You were a seven year old girl.
A: I was seven and a half, and I — nobody, except the American lady, not even Mrs.
Beazer(ph), that I had an emotional reaction to. And after we lit the candles, the
kids and I got a Hershey bar. And that was amazing. That — that — that — coming
into their home was just amazing to me. It was — it was so loving, I couldn’t believe,
you know — and they spoke Yiddish to me.
Q: Ah, that was my question, my next question.

worker, also spoke either German or Yiddish to me, I don’t remember which. But
the — coming from the Baers(ph), she was a very rotund, kind of a fat lady, and he
was very skinny. And they were just so nice to me, and the kids — I don’t remember
the small children, but — but the five year old, Beverly, seemed interested. She
didn’t — you know, she just seemed interested. I don’t know — I don’t know how
much she knew about me, or was told.
Q: Yeah.
A: But it was a good first meeting. It was a wonderful first meeting, and —
Q: Mm-hm, go ahead.
A: —I stayed in that home. I was put into second grade in a school not far from
there. And when I got into the classroom, the teacher didn’t know what to do with
me, cause I spoke Yiddish. And so she decided to put me at the blackboard, and I
copied these big let — these large letters, that she — she saw my handwriting, and she
wanted me to change the H and the G, so I practiced the H and the G on the
blackboard. And there were one or two other children in the class that spoke
Yiddish, and they helped me to understand what to do, and what the different bells
meant, and when it was recess, and when it was —

Camp Louise in Baltimore. They thought this would be good for me. I remember
being very lonely at camp, and I missed the family. I missed the family very, very

my suitcase was there.
Q: This suitcase that we have here.
A: This suitcase was all packed up. And he told me that I was going to another
foster home. What happened was that Mrs. Baer(ph), unbeknownst to anybody, had
another baby. She was pregnant, and she was rotund, and nobody knew that she was
pregnant, not even her husband or her family. I think she left a note in a milk bottle,
or something like that. But she went to Sinai Hospital, to have a baby.
Q: Oh my.
A: So that was her fourth child. And the — Mrs. Beazer(ph) and the agency did not
think it was appropriate for me to stay in this home with the new baby, and that it
was too much for Mrs. Baer(ph).

after some time, the agency — the associated, used her as an interim home for short
periods of time for children that were in — families were in trouble, or something

was a very fast exchange. And Beverly was two and a half years older than me. But
she didn’t look like a 11 or 12 year old. She — I was, by that time, eight and a half.
She must have been about 11 and a half. She looked like a woman. She was
completely developed, and she looked much older than her years. And she was not
pleased. She was not pleased that somebody was coming into the house, and
certainly not me.
Q: Was she a sibling — she — was she the only child?
A: She was an only child, but she had been adopted by the Freilanders(ph) from
the associated Jewish charities when she was six months old.
Q: Oh.
A: So, I guess the — the organization knew about her, and I guess that they thought
that it would be a good thing for Beverly to have a sister. I — I— I don’t know, and I
never found out what motivated them to step forth. So, the next door neighbor came
down, Mrs. Fine(ph), my — and — and her daughter Phyllis. And they thought I was
adorable. But I didn’t get that impression from Beverly. And for the first time, I felt
like a stranger. It was a bad time for me, very bad time. Everybody seemed to think

Q: Oh my goodness. So, did Beverly’s attitude ever change?
A: Sure it changed. I don’t think that — we were so different. We were so different.
Yeah, well, so-somehow we had to make peace with each other, cause we shared a
room all those years. I — I — I— looking back I can’t even envision how — how we
managed, but we did. M — Aunt Mary, that I call — I called them Aunt Mary and
Uncle Harry, she took me to get my braids cut, because she couldn’t handle my —
my long hair. And I mean, I looked, after a while, with new shoes and new clothes,
I looked like anybody, and I did not have an accent, and I spoke perfect English,
better than I do now. And so Beverly and I sort of made a — a peace. We were never
like — we were never close, but we had — you know, we — there were lots of times
where Mary was very ill and she was hospitalized, that we had to take care of the
house, and we did.
Q: Okay.
A: And it was — we had to cooperate, and we did. And as we got older, and Beverly
started to date, and — and we would babysit together and 1-1t got — it got a lot — a lot

better. And by the time that my husband and I were married, we were good friends,
for the for — you know, for si — for the first time, because we were both almost
adults at that time, and we had things in common. For the first time we had
marriage in common. It was different, it was not like being —
Q: And you had years in common, you had a shared history of a —
A: We — we had a shared history and we were both older, and it was different, very
different. By the time I left Baltimore to go into the service with my husband, we
were very, very good friends. We were fre — we were girlfriends.
Q: Mm-hm. You wouldn’t say sisters.
A: I don’t think we really approached that subject. I don’t think we talked about the
old days, and how we felt about each other. We never did that. We talked about
where we were at at that time. And of course, Mary was very, very sick by then.
And Beverly was diagnosed with lupus. And well, the lupus came a few years after
that. When we came back to Baltimore, she wu — developed luka — lupus. And we
were fren — we were — we were tight. We were — we were girlfriends. It was not like
it was before.
Q: Yeah.

Q: What about Uncle Harry”
A: Uncle Harry was very quiet. I remember him being very quiet throughout the —
he was very soft-spoken and very quiet. And we went to the store, to the grocery
store one — on Saturdays together, in the morning. And I always wanted him to talk
to me, to tell me something about himself, or to share something. But he was very
to himself. I really think he was fond of me, he just couldn’t — couldn’t share, he
couldn’t share. I always wanted him — I needed a conversation with him, and I — I
never got that out of him, even — even in later years, before he died, I never got that
out of him.
Q: What about Mary? Or was she too distracted?
A: Mary was very, very — she was very ill, and it just took over everything.
Q: Was her illness of an emotional kind, or physical?
A: No, no, it was physical.
Q: It was physical.
A: She eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson’s.

Q: What I’m surprised by is why the agency, or the fe — yi — was it in a—a-— the a—
Jewish agency”?
A: Yes.
Q: Why they wouldn’t have found another place for you. If the first home, you
know, which was so loving and so kind, okay, has another child, then — and they
can’t handle it, and then the second home, you know, one half of the pil — one pillar
from the family gets sick, that means that — you know, they — they’re for the best of
will, you know, they still are — they’re not able to fully integrate a child. And why
you weren’t moved again? Or maybe — or do you know anything about — did you
ever think about that?
A: I met with Mrs. Beazer(ph) my social worker —
Q: Okay.
A: — about probably once a year at her office, and she never asked me.
Q: How you’re doing?
A: She never asked about the home situation. She talked to me about school, and
she took my loose-leafs, and my books to see what I was doing and how I was

doing. I did very well in school. She never asked that question. She never — I — I had
a feeling that she knew the situation at home, but maybe — maybe there was no
place else to put me, or maybe it was just out of the question to move me again. I
don’t know. She never asked me how things were at home. I think she knew that
Mary was sick. I — I didn’t have the kind of relationship where I could tell her,
well, what I really wanted her to know.
Q: Well, what did — what would you have really wanted her to know’?
A: Maybe it’s something that she knew from the other children that she took care
of, that I was — I felt very much alone. And that I had trouble being Beverly’s sister.
You know, it was difficult. Beverly and I were very, very different. She was not
good in school. She must have had a — a learning difficulty of some sort. And my
report cards were so much better than hers, it was almost embarrassing to me. When
she was 16, she quit school, and ac-actually, when she quit school, she went to work
in a record store. And that’s when it cha — things changed between her and me. She
wasn’t in school any more. She was making a small living for herself. She felt very,
very much relieved. And I think sh — I think our relationship got better at that time,
when she quit school and started working at the stu — at the record store, and she
would bring home records of all kinds, and we would play the records and sing

With Mrs. Beazer(ph) I never felt close enough to share with her —
Q: Is there any —
A: —1n earlier years, what — what was going on. She never asked, and I never told.
Q: That’s quite a lot for a child to carry, all by themselves.
A: I felt very, very much alone, and whenever I went someplace, whether it was
shopping with Mary, or anything, Mary seemed to know everybody, and everyone
said to me, what a lucky girl you are. And I always wanted to cry every time I heard
that. I knew it was — I knew it was right. I knew they were right, but I— I felt so —I
hated that. I hated people telling me how lucky I was. And that was hard for me. I
grew up feeling very much alone. I didn’t know anybody else who was — was — had
my history, and I didn’t know any other children that came — came over like I did.
So I —I grew up feeling very much alone.
Q: Well, you know, you had so many losses, and there wasn’t anybody to
acknowledge that you had those losses.
A: I—I-—I just was known as a lucky girl.

my little book about my experiences, I wanted to write them down for our kids,
because I thought maybe I’d forget, in the future. And when I wrote it — when I
wrote it, I called the book, “Lucky Girl.”
Q: Oh gosh.
A: It was — it sort of — it sort of — I—I was a lucky girl, but I-I couldn’t — I couldn’t
take it all in when I was younger. Now I realize what happened to me, and th-the
times and everything, and —
Q: Well, that’s — but you see, here’s the — here’s the tough part, when you realize
that your destiny is a happier one than it could have been, had you stayed in
Vienna, yes, that’s true, which doesn’t mean that there wasn’t suffering. Because
both can exist in the same story. Both can exist in the same life. And losses can —

beginning, or any time. But —
Q: In what —

there. And I knew we were in the war, but I had no idea what Pearl Harbor meant,
or — but we were at war. And we helped for the war effort. I — I — the neighbors and
I collected scrap iron, and — and I — in the grocery store, we — we collected fat from
customers that would bring it in. And we had air raids, and Harry was an air raid
warden. And I loved going out with him. We would write down the name of people
whose lights were on. And he had a whistle, and other people had a whistle in the
next block, and I would run back and forth with little messages.
Q: Oh wow.
A: And I loved that, I loved being with him. And I felt — I felt very important. But it
wasn’t until long after the war that everybody realized — that people realized and
talked about concentration camps, and losses, and —

badly, that I called Mrs. Beazer(ph), and I spoke to her, and she said — it was adults
talking to each other, instead of children any more. She said, Herta, you’re leaving
Baltimore, and it’s another big move for you. She said, I don’t think it’s about your
mother, I think it’s — it’s about leaving Baltimore. And she said I had nothing to be

to Baltimore after two years. Mary was dying, Beverly was very, very ill. And it
was not a very happy time for me. Beverly was still living upstairs from Mary and
Harry, and Mary was dying. And very suddenly one day, we were in our
apartment — no, I don’t rem — yes, we were in Baltimore, and Beverly’s husband
called one morning and he said, Beverly died very suddenly. She had a cardiac
arrest of some sort, very suddenly, and she died before Mary.
Q: Wow. Wow.
A: So, we were still in Baltimore, and I felt like I was a daughter, but I didn’t feel
like a daughter, and I — I didn’t know what to do. Mary was to the stage where she
couldn’t speak. You couldn’t understand her, she was bedridden. And then we had
Karen. We had Karen before Mary died, and I would take Karen over there, and
put her to sleep in the bed next to — next to Mary, and she — Mary, I could tell that

few months, remarried, a lovely woman. And he ha — he had a good life with her for

knew about Mary and Harry, and they — they knew where they lived, and they
knew — they knew them.
Q: Did you ever speak with anybody about the hard parts, about being a lucky girl?
A: I don’t think so. I think — I think that Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Otz(ph) and —
and maybe the rest of Mary’s family that she was close to, I think they realized that
I felt different. They all liked me. It seemed like — I just had this feeling when I was
in the home, that I was a foster child. I — I just — I don’t know why I — I never felt a
part of them, really, really. It wasn’t — it wasn’t that they didn’t make me feel at
home, it was a feeling, I think it was my own feeling.
Q: Well, for whatever reason, it was there, it was real. And it was a burden. It was a
sorrow that you were carrying.
A: I was. And — and I think I didn’t have very much self-esteem growing up. When
I met my husband and we got married, I — you know, I started to drive a little bit. I

something more practical. And she packed the practical, but she also realized she
