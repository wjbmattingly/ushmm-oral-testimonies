Interview with Ernest Koenig
June 12, 1997
Beginning Tape One, Side A
Answer: -- is Ernest Koenig and we are in my apartment in Watergate at
Landmark in Alexandria, Virginia, and today is the 12" of June, 1997.
Question: Like to go back and ask you several questions about your family.
A: Yes.
Q: If you could give -- give a little background about -- about your family, your --
your immediate family --
A: Yes.
Q: -- their names, and -- and occupations of your parents.
A: Yes, yes. My family lived in a little town in southern Moravia, not far from
Vienna, about 80 kilometers north of Vienna. I could trace my family back to the
17" and perhaps to the 16" century, and they probably lived there all the time.
Perhaps they lived in Vienna, were expelled from there, and then they came back.
And it is not impossible, but that’s just a guess, that my parents and the Jews in
this area were there in the Roman times, because the Roman -- the limit of the
Roman empire was in Vienna, called vie -- viento bona. My father was a glazier,
but he had a hardware shop and he was affluent. My mother and her family came
from the little town where I was raised, but they were very Viennese. And the

whole population there was oriented towards Vienna. Vienna was the great city
from which all the good things, and perhaps e-even bad things, emanated. In 1918,
this part of Moravia was annexed by the Czechs. The Czech Republic was founded
in 1918, but my family, as well as the neighbors and most of the po -- of the
population experienced a very strong affinity to Vienna and to Austria.
Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?
A: [had one brother who 1s still alive, who lives in New York City. I had no
sisters. My family was very large and most of the family was destroyed during the
Holocaust. The Viennese part and the part living in this little town, and the -- only
two cousins and my brother survived.
Q: Is your brother older or younger than you?
A: My brother is 85, I’m 80.
Q: Was your mother a -- a homemaker, managed the home?
A: Yes, my mother was a homemaker. She was a very, very good cook. She was a
very -- lady always of good spirit. She was -- she did many good deeds out --
spontaneously. She had poor people, or people who were -- who were in need, and
she was a very warm person and also her whole attitude was Viennese. For
instance, she would sing all the time, and would sing Viennese songs.
Q: Was your family religious?

A: Well, in my time, only my grandfather was religious. He went every day to the
synagogue, but he said it’s nonsense what they are saying there. Yet he insisted to
go there because he said one has to maintain the tradition. Not to go there would
be a kind of betrayal of our ancestors. And the rest of my family was not religious.
At the high holidays they perhaps would to the synagogue, but not otherwise.
Q: What about your family’s politics, your father and mother’s politics?
A: Well, you know, my father had the great experience of the first World War.
And he, like all the grownups who lived in my time were against the war, were for
democracy, were against the Hapsburgs. So now, as I read history, it turns out that
the Hapsburgs were really protectors of the Jews. They were not against the Jews.
They used the Jews and protected them, that is to say, at least in the last two
centuries, as least since Joseph the second, who contributed to the emancipation of
the Jews who lived between 1780 and 1790. He was emperor of Germany.
Q: When Hitler came to power did your -- was your discussion in -- among your f-
father and mother ab-about what was going on?
A: Well, it was not only when Hitler came to power. My parents and the whole
population was politically very interested, very interested. And I remember that as
a little boy, six years old, I saw the Nazis marching with the red flag, with the
swastika in their flag. But these people were not considered to be our enemies,
because the personal relations with them were very good. So they were in

principle against the Jews, but not in practice. And the -- when Hitler won a great
victory in the elections of 1830 -- of 1930, then the Nazi wer -- Nazi problem and
the Hitler problem became very acute because we knew very well, we understood
very well that might affect us.
Q: Were you --
A: So let me say, we followed it very, very, very closely and although I was a
young person, I didn’t have much experience, I know a lot about the initial time of
the Hitler regime because it fascinated us and we knew, we realized we have a
vital interest 1n it.
Q: Were you close with your brother?
A: Yes. We -- we were very close, even though there was an age difference of five
years.
Q: You played together, and --
A: We played together. Of course, he was the -- the model, the role model whom I
followed.
Q: Is he still?
A: No, but it’s in a different stage of our life.
Q: I wanted to jump way ahead --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- to your meeting with Elizabeth and your f-friendship with --

A: Yes.
Q: -- with her and the first time you met her.
A: Yeah. Well, we met in Paris in 1939. We were refugees, and we were really at
the lowest level of society because we had no country to protect us. The French
didn’t like u -- not -- didn’t like us, not personally, but they had too many
refugees, there was unemployment in France, and at this time I met Elizabeth in
Paris, in the summer of 1939. She went -- she participated in a club of young
[indecipherable] and I once came there and participated in this club, too. A kind of
club, it wasn't a real club. And that’s where we met. And that was before the
outbreak of the war. That was in May 1939 and the war broke out at the beginning
of September.
Q: And did you become friends then?
A: Oh, we became friends from the very beginning, right.
Q: What was it that was the attraction between the two of you?
A: Well, that’s very difficult to say. You know, many great philosophers have th --
have thought about the reasons which attract men and women. I think it’s very
difficult to say. But it was also a tragic time. We met in May 1939 for the first
time, the war broke out at the beginning of September. I volunteered for the army,
SO we were separated. I came back on leave in December 1939 and then again in --
at Easter time, I think in -- in May -- March or April 1939. And then the war

separated us completely, but we met after the war by chance, in a little village in
southern France and were for a short while together, but a couple of months later, I
was interned 1n a concentration camp in France. That was after the defeat of
France and so we -- we -- we didn’t lose contact, because we were 1n
correspondence, but in December 1941, Elizabeth and her family left France for
America. So I didn’t see her from ninet -- from 1940 until 1947 where we met
again in England and then we married.
Q: You also were -- you knew her mother and father.
A: Oh yes, I knew her family very well, yes.
Q: What was your relationship with her father?
A: Very friendly relationship. Her father was a very, very highly educated and
highly intelligent person, so it was very nice and interesting to talk to him and s --
her mother was a very nice lady and a very friendly lady.
Q: And at one point in the video you said you couldn’t stay with them, you had --
you went off --
A: I couldn’t stay with them because when I was reunited with Elizabeth and with
her parents, her parents -- her father was not yet demobilized and they had no
money and nothing to eat. I remember the whole family, that is to say, Elizabeth’s
father, Elizabeth’s mother, Elizabeth and for a couple of days even I ate the ration

which her father got from the military. So one meal for four or five people. That
made it impossible to stay there.
Q: Well now I want to jump ahead further, past --
A: Yes.
Q: -- the war, to liberation. And I wanted to ask you what happened -- if you could
recount what happened immediately following liberation, where you went.
A: Well, my libern -- liberation is a very long story. I de-decided in -- to evade and
not to go along with the SS on their hung -- on their death marches. I was in hiding
and then the Russian army came and I went back -- I tried to go back to
Czechoslovakia, but there was still war, you couldn’t go back. So I very los -- sI-
slowly drifted back to Czechoslovakia and from there to my former home where
there was nobody left. And I stayed another year in Czechoslovakia and that was
the beginning of communism, but it was not the communists 1n power, but you felt
it. So in 1946 I got a visa to go to England where I stayed another year and then I
left England for America and came into America in February 1948.
Q: When -- when -- immediately after you were liberated, what did you have in
your possession?
A: Nothing.
Q: Nothing at all.

A: I had nothing. As a matter of fact, four months -- no, no, that’s not correct, two
months after my liberation, I got the first document which established my identity.
Before -- and I still have it, I had proofs that I was deloused, see, because 1n Polish
towns they tried to prevent the spread of lice, all of us had lice. So they gave you a
paper that you have been 1n a place where they disinfected you.
Q: How was your health, then?
A: My -- I recovered very fast. I had the very good physically constitution, in spite
of the fact that I was fo -- over four years 1n concentration camps, and I was over
four years or even longer hungry. And in spite of the fact that wa -- I collapsed
twice due to hunger, I recovered very fast. Very, very fast. And I -- my liberation
took place in January 1945, and in May, June, I looked absolutely normal and I
felt very well.
Q: Do you remember your first full meal after liberation, what that was?
A: Yes, there I got a little bit sick. We crossed the Czech frontier in February 1945
coming from Poland and we were received by chance, by a Jewish family which
had been hidden in the mountains and had come back. And they had -- they came
back to their own house, there was plenty of food and great comfort and they were
extremely friendly to us. And sure, the first meals made me sick, but that was
temporary.
Q: You ate too much.

A: I don’t know, but 1t made me sick.
Q: Had you been thinking when you were in the concentration camp what it was
you would want to do when you -- if and when you were freed, or you got your
freedom?
A: No, that was impossible, I mean, our main concern was not to be killed. And so
what we would do afterwards was beyond us.
Q: So when you were li -- when you got your freedom, what were your plans,
what were you thinking?
A: I had no plans, and most of those who survived had no plans, because the
impact of the concentration camp was overwhelming and it was very difficult to
find your orientation under these new circumstances. We had no plans. And if I
had a plan it was later on my wish to be reunited with Elizabeth and to go to
America. So if there was any element of a plan, it was America.
Q: Did you know the whereabouts of -- of your parents?
A: Oh yes, I know it very, very wer -- in great detail, for the following reason.
When I came back to Brno, to Moravia, there was a man who had been with one
foot in the concentration camp. He had converted from Judaism and was Catholic,
he had a non-Jewish wife. So he was always supposed to be deported but was not
deported. He was a neighbor of ours and a nice man. And he called me and told
me the following, that during the war a German soldier came to visit him and

brought a message from my father which stated that my f -- my mother had been --
had been massacred together with 30,000 Jewish women -- women and my father
and the husbands and the relatives had to look on. And this German soldier was
behind where my father and his colleagues were. They were -- they formed a kind
of outer chain, then there came my father and the men, then came the SS and then
came my mother and all the women, who perhaps had to -- probably wi -- had to
dig their own grave. So that was one -- and as proof of the veracity of this story,
my father gave to this man, who was a very decent man, who happened to be in
the army, a picture of mine, a photo of when I was about 11 years old. A couple of
days later I met a young man in [indecipherable]. His name was Spitzer, I still
remember it. And th -- after he heard my name, he told me that he had been with
my father in a concentration camp in Lublin, and he knew my father very well and
he confirmed the story, my father had told him the story which I heard from this
former neighbor of ours. And I said goodbye to this young man by the name of
Spitzer and two days later it occurred to me, I have to see him again and talk more
with him. I couldn’t find him any more.
Q: And when you were liberated, you -- you knew that your father had -- had been
killed.
A: When -- you know, I was liberated under very dramatic circumstances, the SS
evacuated some 5,000 of those who were with -- had been with me in the camp,

had come into the camp, and many of them were massacred by the SS after the
people who were originally with -- with -- with me in the camp, had been -- had
left the camp and were on this -- on these death marches. And the camp was -- th-
the SS set fire on the camp and it was very miraculous that I escaped and survived.
And it wa -- it was from this camp, which happened to be between the German
and the Russian front -- we were in between -- that I escaped into the Russian side
and to Poland.
Q: And had you heard news about your father?
A: Oh no. I -- you know, I wasn’t shocked when I heard the story about my -- I
was shocked about the way my mother died, but it was self understood for me that
my whole family is dead. That was --

my father. He knew only abou-about my father had -- th-the message of my father

Q: And what about your brother?
A: My brother was in England.
Q: And did you know that?
A: Oh yes. When I was deported from France, I managed to send him a postcard
saying I am returning home, I don’t like 1t. He understood. I couldn’t say exactly
what happened. And it is -- it was probably a French policeman who mailed --
who mailed this card, because I couldn’t mail it.

few British prisoners of war. Probably also, but I am not sure, a very few
American pilots who had been shot down. And then -- well, all kinds of people
who -- who escaped the Germans. And the Russians tried to help us but they were
very clumsy and very badly organized. So after two or three days I left
Czestochowa. Czestochowa is a very famous town in Poland because one of the
Catholic saints comes from Czestochowa.
Q: When you left there, were you with anyone, or were you by yourself?
A: When I left there I was with somebody and we walked, we decided to walk to
another -- to hike -- I [indecipherable] to say walk -- to another Polish town
Katowice. And we wanted to hike, but there were -- except for Russian military
wagons, there was nobody on the ro -- on the road who would take you along, who
could take you along. So we walked. It was very cold, snow was very high and we
walked to Katowice.
Q: And why were you going there?
A: Because I had the 1 -- I knew the eastern part of Czechoslovakia, he -- has --
has been liberated, so I had the foolish idea to go east, east, east, and cross the
high mountains in -- in winter and go to this liberated part of Czechoslovakia.
Q: And how long did it take you to get there?
A: Well, I can tell you exactly. I left the camp on the 26" of January, 1945, and we
crossed the Czech frontier on the 14" of February, it was rather fast, relatively

fast. But generally we were walking -- perhaps no -- not always. Sometimes we
got a -- a -- somebody took us along. But somebody was always the Russian
soldiers because there was no other vehicle on the road.
Q: What -- you had mentioned, I believe, in your video that in postwar
Czechoslovakia there were -- arbitrary things were happening.
A: Oh yes.
Q: What was that?
A: Well, the Czechs were very badly treated and very badly oppressed by the
Germans, and by the Nazis. And when the war ended, they decided to expel all
German inhabitants of Czechoslovakia. Now that was certainly arbitrary and cruel,
because not all Germans were Nazis. And so the Germans suffered like the Jews.
Not quite like the Jews, but similar to the Jews, because this deportation of the
Germans were under much better condition than the deportation of the Jews.
Created not only hardship, many people died. But the difference was that when the
Jews were dep -- deported, they knew it’s -- 1t’s a death march, th -- it’s -- it’s the
end of life, whereas the Germans didn’t have to fear that they would be bad -- that
they would be killed when they got -- they were deported to Germany. And the
Czechs were very chauvinistic.
Q: Was there much anti-Semitism in postwar Czechoslovakia?

A: No. You know, the -- the czechos -- Czechoslovakia, the Czech --
Czechoslovak Republic was very democratic. Was founded in 1918 and
[indecipherable] 1938 and there was no antisemit -- no anti-Semitism. One of the
few countries where there was no anti-Semitism. It has a very humane and liberal
government, there was no anti-Semitism. And the Czech government also behaved
very tolerantly towards the refugees who came from Germany. After the war, they
come -- as long as it was there the communists were very powerful, it was still a
democratic regime, but they started to prevail. And Is -- as long as I was there I
didn’t -- I didn't notice. There was no anti-Semitism, but I do know that under the
communist regime, shortly thereafter, when they came to power, there started to
be anti-Semitism. And certainly it became stronger and stronger and in 1951,
Czech communists who were Jewish were punished, and one or two were hanged.
And they were selected because they were Jewish. They were Czech communist
Jews.
Q: How long did you remain in Czechoslovakia?
A: I remained in Czechoslovakia one year. From ’45 to ’46 and then I got the visa
for England.
Q: And y -- and during that time you were studying, you went to school?
A: Yes. You asked me before what my plans were. I really didn’t know what I
should do, but I went to school, I went to the university. Not -- not very

enthusiastic, not very devoted to studying, but I went to the university. But I really
don’t -- didn’t know what to do. You know, it was an entirely new situation and
not only for me, for all those who came back and who were more or less in the
same circumstances. Not only were our families destroyed, everything had
changed. So you couldn't find your beer -- bearings very easily.
Q: Yes, you said you were disoriented, that --
A: Yes. And you know, if you read, you know, about the book, “AII Quiet on the
Western Front” by a German writer, Remarque, who describes the first World War
in the west. He wrote a second book which is called “The Way Back.” And 1n this
book he describes the disorientation of former soldiers, German soldiers, they
don’t find their way in the German postwar society. And in a certain sense you
find the same thing with the American Vietnam veterans.
Q: Yeah.
A: And still they don’t find their way.
Q: W-When did you begin finding your way? When did you begin becoming
oriented?
A: Well, I think only in America and only after I had finished my studies. When I
er -- I would say when I got my first jo -- not my first job, no, no, I had many
temporary jobs, but when I got my government job. That was settling back on that

Q: Did you ever think that you would live a normal life after that?
A: Oh yes, why not? But you know, you didn’t see it.
Q: Can you talk about your reunion with Elizabeth?
A: Well, Elizabeth worked at a job in New York City in the New York Public
Library and -- and not necessarily she, but her father scratched together enough
money to take a trip to Europe, and they came incidentally with the Queen
Elizabeth, which was a luxury boat, more or less. And we met in London after
these many years, and she found that we love each other as we did before and we
decided to marry, and so we married. And yesterday it was 50 years since we
married. Of course we never expected that -- is that we would marry -- we met in
Paris. We were bo-both born in Vienna. We never expected that we would marry
in the Royal Borough of Kensington, in -- which is part of London.
Q: Well, congratulations on your 50" anniversary. How did you first get word that
Elizabeth was even alive?
A: I mean, I think in July nine -- th-the war ended in May 1945 and I think by July
communications were possible, and I had a cousin in America, in New York and
knew -- he knew Elizabeth and he knew my address, and I had written to him and
so I [indecipherable] Elizabeth.

Q: So you were married 1 -- after -- a week after you were --
A: Right, right, something -- something like this, yes.
Q: And that was a surprise to you, or --
A: No, no, no, we intended to marry.
Q: Oh yeah?
A: Yeah.
Q: You knew that you were going to -- to see her and that you would probably ask
her to marry you?
A: Yes, yes, yes.
Q: Then, how long before you came to America?
A: I came to be married in June 1947, and I came to America in February 1948.
Q: And you had to remain in Britain for awhile?
A: Thad, because you see, at that time American immigration was based on quotas
and the quotas depended on the pla -- on the country where you were born. So I
was not born in Czechoslovakia, I’m Viennese born, so I was in the Austrian
quota. And because of persecution, and the Austrian quota was always
oversubscribed, it was very difficult to get a visa. And I got priority because after
having married, I was the husband of an American citizen. Elizabeth was already
an American.
Q: So what was that like, coming to America in 1948?

A: Oh, to come to America was very impressive and it wasn’t very encouraging
because you wondered how you can withstand all the institution tha -- I mean, not
the institution but the way of life that you didn’t know. It took some time. Takes
every immigrant some time before he gets somehow settled. And that affects all --
all phases, all aspects of life. For instance, when I came to America, on the first or
second day, I asked when we have to go to the police to register. I didn’t realize
and couldn’t understand that you don’t have to go to the police and register.

notary public, and I was told it’s the newspaper man at the corner. I couldn’t
imagine that a newspaperman could be the notary public, because in Europe a
notary public was a man of a certain standing, like a lawyer, with a big office. So I
went around the newspaper stand, I was looking for a sign that this 1s the notary
public, until I realized, or somebody made my mistake understood to me.
Q: So, you were still disoriented.
A: Yeah -- so -- but a -- but yeah, cli -- they are little things and I think all
Americans, or most Americans -- no, all Americans except the Indians hail from
immigrants. But the present generation and those who have se -- have -- who have

been -- who -- who -- who are natives of America don’t realize what it means to be
an immigrant anywhere, not only in America. For instance -- after all I was a
person of common sense, I didn’t know how to do certain things at the post office,
because your -- the way the post office worked here 1s different from how it works
in Europe. Now, that’s the other way around to, if you move to Europe, or to any
other country.
Q: And how was your English when you first came to --
A: Well, I could speak, but it -- 1t was broken, it was broken English and I really
have ne -- never fully acquired a mastery of English.
Q: So what were your impressions of -- other than the examples that you gave,
about the notary --
A: Well, the impression were overwhelming, primal -- primarily because America
is more advanced in many respects than Europe. And number two, I came from
war-torn Europe, which had fallen back beyond the time when the war broke out.
Even in England, conditions were pretty tough as compared to pre-war times, to
peace. And the American civilization is quite different from the European
civilization. So there are many aspects and many details which we have to learn
about, to which we have to get accustomed.
Q: Elizabeth said that -- that it was the freedom that was remarkable. Being able to
just walk down the street.

A: Yeah, that was remarkable, not only the freedom in comparison to what
happens now, also the safety and security. For instance, I worked -- when I was in
New York, when I studied, I worked in a typewriter shop. And sometimes we
were told by our bosses to bring a typewriter somewhere to some part of the town,
to the Lower East Side, to deliver it there. There was no fear whatsoever that
somebody would take the typewriter away. There was no fear at all at that time,
when I came to America, that somebody would attack you, that somebody will
mug you.
Q: So what were your plans when you came to America, did you have any?
A: I had no plans.
Q: And how did you [indecipherable]
A: I thought it’s -- it’s -- it’s reasonable to try to continue my studies. And that
what I did during the first two years. But I wasn’t sure whether my studies would
help me and whether I -- whether I would succeed in getting a reasonable position,
or a reasonable job.
Q: What was -- what was it that you wanted to do?
A: [really didn’t know what I wanted to do.
Q: You were doing odd jobs?
A: Yeah, but the odd jobs I did only because I was studying. I wanted to finish my
studies. I wasn’t very hopeful that would help me.

Q: And were you going -- you were going to school while you were living in New
York?
A: Oh yes, I went -- from the very beginning I went to school for about two years,
then I made my Master’s -- I got my Master’s degree and then I was able, with the
help of Elizabeth’s father to get a job as junior instructor at Johns Hopkins
University. That was miserably paid. Elizabeth worked in -- we were in Baltimore,
Elizabeth worked in the veteran’s hospital and that we were -- that what we were
living from. And then I decided I cannot continue living on such a small salary,
which practically was no salary. I have to look for another job, and Baltimore
being near Washington, I went to Washington looking for a job and I got one and I
got first -- I got a very good offer in the treasury, but I needed a job immediately
so I got a summer job in the Department of Agriculture, a two month’s job and s --
out of these two months became 40 years.
Q: You studied political science, or what did you study at Hopkins?
A: Economics.
Q: Economics. And when was it that you decided that that’s what you wanted to
do?
A: Oh, the moment I came -- the moment I came, I think the second or third day
after my arrival, I decided I have to continue my studies. I had studied in Europe,
too. And the question what to study was clear, economics. It seemed to be clear.

Q: Why was that clear to you?
A: Because it seemed to be a practical occupation, not to remove from life, not
necessarily a research [indecipherable] you can make research in economics, but it
dealt with contemporary events. And that, of course, was of great interest.
Q: When did you become an American citizen?
A: In 1950, bec -- I didn’t have to wait five years because my visa was based on
my -- on Elizabeth being an American citizen. So after two years I became a
citizen.
Q: Was that significant for you? Was it very meaningful?
A: Oh, certainly it was very meaningful. It was more than meaningful, it was a
major event, because you mustn’t forget, we always speak about the Holocaust
and of -- and of persecution. But the fact that we were refugees before, meant that
we were odd man out, we had no legal status. We had no country to which we
could appeal for protection. Nobody cared for us. So to be again -- to have again a
little status, and what was more, to be an American citizen was grandiose. So that
was certainly a great event.
Q: Was it in a -- in aroom or a place where a lot of people were?
A: No, no, it was my cousin -- my second cousin who is now dead, and I don’t
know who else went with me. Elizabeth? I don’t think Elizabeth. Somebody. Wa -

- the fact of the event was impr -- impressive.
Q: What -- what did it mean to you then to be an American?
A: Well, to be the citizen of a big country, which was a free country, and a
humane country, but I -- I -- I mean, I wouldn’t say I’m -- I never believed I am a
Yankee, or I could become a Yankee. I was a citins -- citizen of the United States.
And don’t forget, I was born under an emperor and I was an Austrian citizen. And
then the empire collapsed, then I became a Czechoslovakian citizen. Then I was
nothing, because there was no Czechoslovakia any more and nobody else wanted
to recognize our nationality. Then -- so when I became an American citizen, this
had many aspects, many positive aspects, but from a very personal point of view,
it meant that was again -- that I wa -- I was again irregularized. What is a man who
has no country? He’s a nobody in the sense of the world.
Q: Was there -- I-I’m sure there were negative aspects of -- of your -- your arrival
to America and your -- your transition.
A: Yeah.
Q: What -- what were some of them -- were the hardest things?
A: I don’t think there were any negative aspects. I was not very encouraged that I
would be able to succeed. I mean, I was interested in economics. I was interested
in studying and then teaching, that was very nice, in Johns Hopkins, so it was a

modest position. But teaching there was very nice and I liked it. But I couldn’t see
how I could return to a normal, middle class life, because during s -- up to the time
I had gotten a job in the government, I was not mi -- I was not middle class, I was
very far down, no, that didn’t -- that was no hardship. That was one of the positive
aspects of America, that in spite of the fact that I had very, very, very little money,
I could have a breakfast which was richer than the breakfast of a European
minister of that time. Unless he dealt on the black market, he couldn’t have a
breakfast, at that time, which cons -- for less than one dollar I could buy toast with
butter, a piece of bacon on it, orange juice -- imagine orange juice at that time in
Europe -- compared to Europe, and -- and coffee. So I wasn’t suffering in any
way.
Q: Why did you have such doubts about your ability to ex -- succeed?
A: Because we didn’t know how -- I didn’t know how to succeed in America. You
know it only afterwards. You cannot judge an experience which you don’t have.
Q: You -- did you -- you consider yourself an ambi -- ambitious person before the
war? Did you have a-ambitions and --
A: No, I am not ambitious, but I am interested in many things, and I am
particularly interested in history, not only for academic reasons, but I lived
through it. You know, we -- we lived in Czechoslovakia and during my earlier life
in a very, very upsetting time. I mean, the collapse, for instance, of Austria was a

major, major event. And the collapse of Czechoslovakia, the abandonment of -- of
the Czechs [indecipherable] England. All these were major events which affected
us, of course. So, it was difficult to find, at the beginning, a satisfactory
orientation. One didn’t know what’s going to happen.
Q: Di-Did people wa -- in your first few years in America, did people ask you
where you were from, what had happened to you? Were they curious, did you talk
to them about what had happened?
A: Well, you know, when you asked for -- when you applied for a job in New
York City, people were not allowed to ask you where you are coming from. It’s --
you know, in -- in order to -- to avoid any discrimination. But on the other hand,
people had not the slightest idea of the Holocaust. That’s a phenomenon that’s an -

talk and fuss about the Holocaust. But people here discovered this only -- well, I
would say in the 80’s, not before.
Q: People ask about the number on your arm?
A: No, they didn’t even know what it is. I mean, you know, that was, for instance,
one of the great contrasts between America and Europe, because in America -- 1n
Europe people knew about the Nazi regime, and it was not only a Jewish affair,
thousands of non-Jews, 10 thousands, hundred thousands [indecipherable]. When
you heard what the Pope said when he was in Poland, he s -- he went to a place
where 135 Polish intellectuals, officers, had been arrested and sent to
concentration camps. It was German policy. And all of them died.
Q: So people weren’t asking you --
A: No.
Q: -- or inquiring. Were you telling anyone, were you talking about it?
A: No, because nobody was no -- 1n the first place nobody was interested. In the
second place, the few people who were interested were afraid to hear ster -- and
still are, still afraid to hear stories about concentration camps. All this talk avoids
talking about what happened in concentration camp. Because the listener identifies
himself or herself with the person who tells the story and is afraid and shrinks
away. I mean, people go as far as Anne Frank because she doesn’t speak of in -- of

SS comes to the fore.
Q: Was that frustrating to you or would you rather have, at that point not have
talked about it?
A: Well, I was always willing. I think one should talk about it, it’s a -- it’s a major
event. But I was not frustrated, I mean, you consider people as being ignorant,
because -- and not understanding the time in which they are living, if they show no
interest. But I know why they show no interest, they do show interest, but they’re
afraid of it.
Q: Was it still very much alive for you a -- at --

Q: How much did Elizabeth know about what happened to you in your early years
and when did -- when did you start telling her the details?
A: Well, she knew in general what has happened. But, I mean, she hadn’t
experienced it either, and she was in the same category as the non-survivors. Non-
survivors in the sense of not having gone through this phase.

A: Yes.
Q: -- about Auschwitz and -- and --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and I suppose -- and she said she hadn’t known a-about it, so that you hadn’t
gone into great detail about your experience.
A: No, you cannot, because it’s very complex story. For instance, I was in
Auschwitz, but what was Auschwitz? Auschwitz was a series of camps, not one
camp. And one of the camps was Birkenau, where people came to be killed
immediately. In the other camps, where we worked, many people were killed, and
people died. For instance, I was lucky not to die of hunger. I was once near the

subject, very complex subject.

Q: Uh-huh.
A: Sorry.
Q: But she had said there was a -- there was a gray period where you just didn’t
discuss it, because she wasn’t sure --
A: Oh. I never hesitated to discuss it with anybody. It was the f -- the fear of
others, of your listeners, which we -- you noticed, which discouraged you to speak
about the details.
Q: When -- when did you talk to your daughter Nicole about your experience?
A: Oh, I -- slowly. You cannot tell such a story to a child, still less when you’re in
Germany with the -- when we came to Germany, I mean, I was attaché in Bonn,
she was six years old. And she did -- she went five days into the amer -- an
American school, but on the sixth day we sent her to a German -- on Saturday she
had to go to a German school, you know, to learn German, and she hated to go to

circumstances you couldn’t tell her where we are and what happened. But she

Q: Ivory tower?
A: Ivory tower. It was far removed of real life. So I looked for a job and I found a
job, a temporary job, which then lasted 40 years. And I was very happy in that job
for many reasons. First of all, it was a rather solid position -- a comparatively solid
position. Number two, the subject was very, very interesting. It was a world
agriculture, world trade, trade policy, very, very interesting subject. And I and all
those who worked in the Department of Agriculture on this particular subject were
very lucky because we learned about foreign policy, we follo -- followed foreign
policy developments in foreign countries. And from a purely intellectual point of
view, we had a very interesting job. And I was in the Department of Agriculture.

from °59 to ’64 and then I was transferred to Brussels to the common market. And
there I was agricultural attache for 10 years. And I probably could have stayed
there forever, but I got an offer to lead the American agricultural delegation in a
big trade negotiation in Geneva. It was called the Tokyo round because the
decision to enter such negotiations was made in Tokyo. So I was then s -- seven
years -- no, over seven years, six years -- less than seven years, six years in
Geneva, then I came back to Washington. I was here for two years and then I was
appointed agricultural attaché -- no, counselor. Counselor for agricultural affairs at

to graduate [indecipherable] at the German university in Prague before the war.
After the war the German university didn’t exist any more. And I went for one
year to the Czech university. And both the German and the Czech university had
the names, Charles University. So I was very familiar with German -- and I had
never lived in Germany, but still coming to Germany -- except in the concentration
camp, I was familiar with their way of talking, with their way of thinking. I was
very familiar with everything, which facilitated my work. At that time most, not
all, but most of the people with whom I dealt, were former Nazis. Of course, they
were hiding it, but they couldn’t hide it. I didn’t discuss anything with them, but

burning -- to burn them, no. And [indecipherable] said, all of them should have
been burned, there are still some survivor.
Q: You overheard that?
A: Oh yeah, we overheard that.
Q: How did that make you feel?
A: Well, it was laughable, I mean, you see, Nazism is a very complex per -- very,
very complex problem. It requires a lot to understand why it happened, who did it.
For instance, those who were the SS, those people who were in the concentration
camps and killed people and tortured people, these were the lowest of the lowest.
You know? These were at the margin of society. The others acquiesced in it. Take
the German government. Hitler was a man who had no career before he became a
politician. Goering was a -- a former officer who didn’t find his bearings after the
war. They were all people at the margin of society. But these people didn’t kill, I
mean, all -- at -- at the top. But those who were in the camps, the SS, the SA and
those from the -- the police battalions who were in Poland and killed not only
Jews, but thousands, 10 thousands of Poles. These people were really the -- the
scum of the earth. Really, from every point of view the scum of the earth and they
were also, I would say, the scum of the German people.

Every year by the end of January, there was this big exhibition. And at two or

that apart from this lowest level of society, the guilt of the German people
consisted in acquiescence, rather than in active persecution. On the other hand,
there was resistance, and there were so many shades of attitudes, like these two
people who -- but there were many more shaped like these two people whom we
overheard in the restaurant. And one said expel, the other said kill, and so on and
so on and so on. And then, how can you judge any nation? A nation consists of
millions of people. How can you really judge and know what their feelings are and
what their attitude are? And one important thing, no country in modern times has
suffered such dictatorship as the German people. It was incredible, it was -- the
dictatorship alone was German efficiency. And the Germans, who believed they
are courageous, were afraid. And how could you -- how could you oppo -- if you

concentration camp, at least.
Q: Did you go back to Auschwitz after the war?
A: No, I didn’t go back, but not because of any fear of being overcome by
emotions, but simply for the following reasons. When I was in Germany, or in --
no, in Brussels, I once made a trip to France and I visited the military camp where
I had served in southern France. And there was nothing left. I didn’t recognize the
place. I knew that was the place. The barracks had gone, there was no spirit in it.
And I know when I go to Auschwitz, there is no shouting SS, no fear. What you
see are remnants of a different time. They don’t tell me anything. I have my own
memories, but the memories will not be revived.

A: -- no, there is no use. Yeah, I was with Elizabeth last year in Austria and
another person who was with us wanted to see Mauthausen, and they went there. I

distressed. It 1s not the same. What you see are not living things.

Q: Because Elizabeth was not at a -- a concentration camp --
A: Yeah.
Q: -- or -- or an extermination camp, do you not consider her a survivor?
A: No, a survivor -- the question is what do you survive? If you were not in a
concentration camp you’re not a survivor of a concentration camp. If you were not
in a battle, you’re not survivor of this battle. No, I mean -- oh yes, she is a -- she
was persecuted, she had her own experiences. But that’s one thing. One cannot
speak of survivors who didn’t survive a certain -- a certain event or a certain
process. On the other hand, there is no merit to be a survivor and nobody has to be
proud of -- of having been a survivor. You can be -- no, one shouldn’t be proud at
all. I think pariet -- parietes should not be applied. One can be satisfied, one can be
happy to have survived or satisfied to have shown resistance and courage. But to
be proud? The Bible says pride cometh before the fall. I mean, I just mention this,
but there is no merit in it.
Q: You hear a lot about survivor’s guilt. Have you ever experienced any of that?
A: No, that’s nonsense. What kind of guilt? Did they do anything wrong, that they
survived? They should be happy that they survived. You know, there are many
false stories, there’s a whole mythology about the survivor and the survivor’s
children. The children are influenced by ha-having learned about what happened

Why? It’s ridiculous.
Q: How do you think Nicole, your daughter was influenced by you being a
survivor?
A: She learned it gradually and it -- she understands, I think. You know, she also
had th -- she went -- she was with us in Germany and she went to the German
school, and she hated school and she hated this. But then she -- when she came to -
- when we were in Brussels, we sent her to a school where you -- the children were
taught in their mother tongue, in -- and in a foreign language. Now, there was
however, only a limited number of languages which were considered mother
tongue, and English was at that time not considered the mother tongue for a child.
So she went to courses which were in German, which was considered her mother
tongue, and in French. Geography was in French, history was in German and so
on. And she learned German in Brussels at the school, not in Germany. No, she --
she has a very objective attitude, and you know, she has such a -- very good
experiences about Germany. And I must say, I was going to -- I have gone to
German grade school, I repeat this, to German high school, to German -- to
German university. And in grade st-school, my teacher was a neo-Nazi, probably
later on was a Nazi. In -- in -- in the -- in high school for eight years, the head of
the teachers was a Nazi. And I had good experiences with him, but that doesn’t

German friends. Chauvinism 1s really a high degree of ignorance [indecipherable].
Chauvinism is a high degree of stupidity. Why should one hit somebody because

the war?
A: No, I -- you know, the story is as follows. When I was in Vernet, which was a
horrible French concentration camp, but we were not beaten or tortured, we were
hungry and we -- people starved to death, I was there by mistake, as they said, so
to facilitate -- to ease my position, I was made assistant postmaster, which meant I
could circulate in the camp and distribute -- distribute the mail. And one day

very beautiful stamps. And so I became acquainted with him without knowing him

A: And then he helped me -- that was at the time when I broke down out of
hunger, and he was able to -- you know, he was our kapo and as kapo, he was
supervising the food rations which we got. And he managed to let me have two of
rations. And in this way I ris -- I recovered again.
Q: Do you know what happened to him after the war?
A: Yes. Well, I don’t know, but the end of the story 1s -- I don’t know whether I
told this in the first interview. I was on good terms with him, he had helped me.

[indecipherable] many Frenchmen and sometimes it was a piece of a paper, but
there was a paper, a Parisian paper which stated that six -- six French resistance

names was Stanislaw Kubacic. Now whether it was the same, I don’t know.
Q: Do you ever go to any reunions, or do you ever meet up or talk with any of the
other survivors at your [indecipherable] camp --
A: No, I have a friend who happened to be in the same camp as I was, but I don’t
know -- I don’t know any survivors here. I would be interested to talk to people,
but I don’t know any.
Q: What would you be interested in talking to them about?
A: Because, when you talk to people who have the sim -- a similar experience as
you, you learn about new details which you didn’t experience, or which you didn’t
know. Also, recollections came -- come back if you talk with somebody you --
there might be an event which you have entirely forgotten. And somebody

doesn’t want to hear about it. It doesn’t matter to me.
Q: How -- is it always on your mind, do you think about it a lot, is it never far?
A: Well, you know, I had -- up to now, now my memory weakens very strongly.
But I had an excellent memory. I don’t know why, I cannot explain. You might
have noticed that I said on the 14" of February we went to Czechoslova --

the past. And so shortly I -- but I live it, my whole past, it’s not only concentration
camp. So, no doubt that was one of the greatest events in my life. If I say one, it
was the greatest, but there was another one, which was of short duration. But I was
in the Battle of France when France lost the war, and to be -- only for a short da --
time, under fire, under -- under -- under the fire of guns, it’s quite an experience.
But that was the same in Auschwitz because we were bombed and I was in the
middle, once. Not all the time. But once I w -- the bombs were falling right and
left. So that -- it wasn't such a great experience, I’Il tell you why. It was
intellectually, mentally it’s a bit -- it was very noisy. You know, noise is horrible.

when -- when we were shelled by ar-artillery.

A: Yes.
Q: -- noises that remind of --
A: Yes.
Q: -- of that camp.
A: I have the strange experience of having been led to the gallow, to a temporary
gallow and th -- together with several other boys, and this gallow where they
wanted to hang us was one of the cement with a kind of poster which -- you s --

is a bit -- a little bit curved, and the fence is fixed on this. When I see such a thing,

Q: It reminds you of that.
A: Oh, it reminds me, yes. But I tell you, I have -- I had very few dreams wer --
were a-about the concentration camp. I had some about bombing. Bombing was a
terrible experience, but had very few nightmares about the concentration camp.
And yet, I-I think of it, not with pleasure, but I think of it and what happened. And

of certain things which you might have forgotten.

A: Yeah.
Q: -- or the near hanging incident had somehow receded in your memory for
awhile.
A: Yeah. Right. I say there, or I believe it has receded because there was an
[indecipherable] to -- to suppress it, you know? To me -- because it was really -- I
mean, even the bombs were falling, when they were beating us, when I -- when I
was so weak that I gave up really. I was about to ga -- give up. I -- I couldn’t do
any [indecipherable]. That didn’t give you the feeling of the imme -- the feeling of
immediate death, but this event, when they wanted to hang us, that was really the
next -- the next thing is nothing. The next thing you are not here any more. And
that, perhaps, created in me the desire to push it aside.
Q: When did it resurface and did you actually forget that it happened, or you just
sort of pushed it way back?
A: You know, I have written my souvenirs -- my memoirs, and they are 420 pages,
my whole life. It starts with my birth, until 1990. And of course a large part 1s
devoted to the camp experience. And there, when I started to write this, then it
came back, in all clarity. It was here, I knew about it.

contrasts and full of extraordinary experiences, I should write it down. And I have
done, but it’s no -- really not finished, and I don’t know -- I would like to -- I
would like to have it published, but not because I am I-looking for glory, or -- or
for a name or something. Just because I would like to give it to people and if I

had the -- the SS and we had the hunger, the beating of the -- by the SS, but the
bombing was something -- an extraordinary event.
Q: I was curious to read where you thought the bombing of th -- o-of the railroad
line would have been insignificant because they would have built it back up and
that’s a --
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: -- I mean, still to this day a debate.
A: Yes. I say this because I myself has -- have worked on rebuilding trucks and I
know how fast it goes. And you know, if -- if the -- the rail -- the -- the rails to
Auschwitz had really been bombed, so the Germans would have taken the people
out and shot them. They were able to shoot thousands, 10 thousands. It’s, for
instance interesting that the story I heard about my mother -- and I heard it from
two sources, spoke always of 30,000. 30,000 people having been massacred there.
In the literature about the Holocaust and about massacres, I think I’ve never read
about 30,000. Perhaps Babi Jar, but I don’t know whether they have been killed at

Q: Do you still consider yourself lucky, or fortunate?
A: Yes, lucky -- luck -- lucky -- chance is the right word, because chance 1s a
double meaning. It’s chance [indecipherable] and it’s chance opportunity, yes. So I
was lucky because I had -- there were chances. And the chances were just chance
and -- but also opportunity. I am satisfied -- not proud, but satisfied that I took
certain decisions which were very dangerous, but I dared to take them. One was to
get in -- to get into hiding when the camp was evacuated because if they had
caught us, they would have killed us. They were very jittery. The SS was very
jittery, they were afraid. And there were other occasions where I took very risky
decisions, but I felt that has to be done, that 1s the impor -- the thing to do. And
now I am older -- not only older, I’m old now, which is -- which amuses me. You

something. And this Tom Mix the SS man was similar, he always wanted to find a

deliberate and thought it’s too risky, I mean, I will not succeed.
Q: Did surviving make you -- how did it affect your spirituality? Did it make you
more spiritual, or did it have --
A: No, it makes me more realistic. I like intellectual activities, but I don’t like

Q: How does it make you more realistic?
A: Well, you see what 1s possible. You see la -- how human beings behave and
you see what can happen. I mean, the idea of my mother -- come back to my

unrealistic. You can say out of this world, yet it happened. And so many other
things happened.

they’re weak. And that is one of the basic explanation for the behavior of the
German people. Just think of the fact that the Germans were one of the most
civilized people in the world. And they were a Christian people, I mean they had
to learn certain moral -- moral -- moral be -- about moral behavior. But don’t you
do what we must not do. And they acquiesced in these horrible events, in this
horrible policy. But they were afraid and fear, fear is one of the most potent
motives for human beings.
Q: Do you consider yourself a hopeful or an optimistic person?
A: Yes, I’m optimistic. Which doesn’t mean that we might not anticipate horrible
things to happen. Horrible things. Why, the Holocaust could repeat itself on a
much larger scale. Or when the Jews were killed as -- suppose six million were
killed, 20 million or more, it’s perhaps 30 million Russians were killed, in one
way or another. They were not only shot, I mean, they died of starvation after the
war came to an end. Millions of Poles have been killed. So there could be a new
Holocaust -- I don’t mean, necessarily an anti-Jewish Holocaust, though it could
be an anti-Jewish Holocaust.
Q: Do you think your -- your testimony and the testimony of other survivors
makes that less of a possibility?

founded and who promoted the Holocaust Museum, because the horror of these

events is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent its repetition. And moreover,
concentration on the Holocaust alone doesn’t give you a sufficient explanation of
what happened. You cannot understand the Holocaust if you only speak of the
Holocaust. You have to see the whole system which ruled in Germany and which
was one of the most barbaric systems in history. Imagine what they did. Not only
did they kill people, murder people, but they took their teeth, their gold teeth or
their hair. Now, the most backward people considered it anathema to utilize parts
of human bodies. I mean, the -- the cannibals, that’s a different -- the cannibals are
something quite different. The Germans, the Nazis were below cannibalism.

experiences connected ti -- with the Holocaust more plausible and understandable.

doing nothing, just standing there freezing and shivering, that was an
extraordinary experience. Or, how can one -- and one doesn’t do it really -- is in

cold. This is difficult to convey, but however little you can convey, may be useful.

Q: Was it always that way, or --

Q: Do you ever think about what your life would have been like had the Holocaust
not taken place?
A: Yes, but I did -- I do not come very far. I cannot imagine it. But there was
another thought which we had particularly at the beginning. When we were
deported to Germany, the question was, why are we deported. And while we
thought of ourselves as workers who will have to work, why do they dis -- deport
old people and children? What sense does it make? These people cannot work.
And there, I personally envisaged that the Germans are going to establish a slave
county or country or area somewhere in Ukraine, that’s there -- that that is our
future. We might be slaves forever, if we survive. And then, you know, there’s
another thing, we must not think of it respectively in the sense of drawing
conclusion on the basis of knowledge which one acquired only after an event took
place. For instance, I didn’t know, and my colleagues, we didn’t know that the
Germans are bent to kill all of us. Really, not only all of us, that we expected. We
