A I think there was a time that the Jews were accused of treason in the first war
corroboration with the Germans. So the Russians did send them out of the Lithuania. I
presume that you know it.
Q A little bit, yeah.
A So actually only after -- only when Lithuania became independent people started
to come back.

back. They stayed in Russia and became communists. They had had enough or maybe
not. But I know for sure that my family, my father's family, my grandmother and her

and later immigrated to Palestine and professor for that, but I came and asked him,
please, help us to build a Hebrew high school. Because he was a teacher and a
pedagogue, but I was asking myself why did the clever Jews need this German Jew to
help them to build the school? | Youdon'tknow.  Soused to be called Travis (ph).

Q And I think of religion.

A No, for them.
Q I see.
A It was Lithuanian Jew. What we called a Lithrock (ph). His name
was Aliaza Benny Huda (ph). He took the Bible and he built a new language and
modern. It was suitable for every day life. So, of course, I can read all the religious
books, but I can also read if I go to Cocoran (ph).
Q Excuse us fora second. Okay.
A The man, in a little bit, although they use table for book and in Kaunas we are very
-- this writer was by the name of Avraham.

that I have relatives in America. I never knew that a grandfather from my mother's side
broke it and he is buried there. —_I never knew. They never told me. It wasn't an issue.

he was so hungry.

mother-in-laws, you know, they are not so -- they don't have such a good reputation with
the daughter-in-laws, but you would have missed out because Uri's mother was a very
special person. Even in the concentration camp, at the worst of conditions, when people
lost signs of humanity, she was like -- she was like helping everybody. Doing
everything. I believe she used the term, it has been so many years since she said it, she
was like -- like somebody, like an angel. That says something for a person.
Q That's right. A reputation that lives beyond.
JUDY: Yep.
Q Were you closer to her than to your father, yeah?

messus (ph) and there he used to meet because the second factory was in Palestine. They
moved. They built it and then the second one was in Beirut and he used to meet
with the Palestinian at that time partners, who came to him and he used to treat and buy
the wood from there and then send some of it to Achor and part of it to communist. So he
went --
Q He was on the road a lot?
A He was on the road.
Q Was he distant?
A I still remember -- remember that. I remember him distant. | You know, there
was a cafe in Calmuth (ph). Have you ever heard of Monica (ph)?
Q No.
A It was a very famous cafe, on Lisadown (ph) and afternoon the men used to -- I'll
show you a picture. I had back -- maybe I might make you a cup of coffee. Look how
the Yiddish people looked down in Kaunas. Like aunts and uros (ph).

Q To sit in the grand cafe in Monica?
A In Monica. Geta piece of cake or milkshake or whatever and sit with his
friends. And I read a selfi (ph) in Elistanova (ph). You know what Stanova (ph) 1s?
Stanova 1s -- there was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I
used to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories. Most of the stories he
repeated. I knew it already by heart. But the story, like, for the mitelda (ph)
mysitatelga (ph), which means, I'll tell you a story with a white goat, the schetzliata (ph)
and mitsushaka (ph). So, this was very good. You could tell it, but I always listen to it
and the whole story about the goat and the sheep, the schetzliata sheep. She is red
and so there is a fourth little stories. But, Monica stories, and traveling. He
didn't go to the summer house. — He used to come only on weekends.
Q He worked? He worked?

Q Were your parents happy together? Was it a good couple? A good
marriage?

injured. And we got a shock and laid in a hospital for a year.
Q Wow. How old were you?
A He never -- he never came back. Three and five.Q How old were you when
that happened?
A Ten. It was on the eve of Passover and see then eve of Passover the Russians
shut down was a New Year. He always come home, but when such a thing -- today they
don't men -- they can't skip. Lithuanians it was a holiday. It wasn't a religious
family. It was a religional family. It definitely wasn't a religious.
The school was not a religious. They didn't even taught us how to pray. This was
anti-religious I would say in away.
Q Really. Yeah.
A They wanted a new product, the modern Jew. Another settled Jew. They created
the new Jew. This new Jew existed many years. This was when he was very rich and he
became babahelshoa (ph) or rothchild or what the feuher (ph) or whatever, but novawent
(ph) it was a schetel (ph) and schetel was odo (ph). The schetel was very progressive
in away that instead of you following that mystical organization. If I was to go to
Lithuania I will buy for you the book that Gustadtz (ph) did.
Q Okay.
A When you read the book you understand everything.

Q Okay. I want to ask a few other questions that are before the war and then we
come to those -- all those other events. In your family circle and in the people that you
knew, did you have any friends who were not Jews? Was your world self-contained?
Was it a Jewish world or was it one that was mixed?
A That's a political, yes.
Q Yes, it 1s. But it is also a social question. _ It 1s trying to get a sense of how
closed were societies? How closed were communities? How open were communities?
How much did people know about one another?
A No, no non-Jewish friends.
Q No non-Jewish friends.
A It's not only that, the Jews lived in Lithuania, not like in Germany. In Germany,
a Jew was not a Jew. He was only believed in the religion of Moses. But mainly he was a
German. Wherein Lithuania and Poland, no. Mostly in Lithuania. Lithuania is
very classic forit. It 1s a society -- a Jewish society which doesn't mingle with the
unJews. I mean, when the children, of course, the grown-ups used to make business
friends. But I didn't have any non-Jewish friends. I had no Jewish friends when we
went to Palanga, not Kretinga, Palanga because there were no other Jews. We are the
only family, maybe another one. And there it was -- I was -- I played there, but as friends,
I cannot recall anybody that I kept on a relationship with him later on.

Another way this happened, it is abnormal in away, but I don't -- I don't know, for
example, Jewish children in another kadanzing (ph). What I know is my class. That's
all. © Wewere friends. Later on, when we went to the university it was different.
University was another program under misbasis (ph) but no, we lived in Autersak (ph),
the three recos (ph) which is vis-a-vis the Paluno (ph).
Q Can you repeat the name of the address again?
A Autersak.
Q Autersak, No. 13. Youlived there? That's a lovely place to live.
A It was a lovely place.
Q It is a very nice place, yeah.
A If you go out of the door --
Q I'll spell it.
A -- and you see --
Q It is townhouse square.
A -- with catali and --
Q Catali, it is a kind of tree.
A But it is in a house I lived other Jewish people.

Q Would you say then, you've mentioned her once before, you said that there was a
maid who lived in your family. | A maid who lived in your family. Was she the only
person who was non-Jewish that you interacted with in a regular way? Yes?
A She was everything to me. She was a maid. She was a nanny, but something
happened to her. She became pregnant. And Teresa was born. Her name
was Vinsa (ph).
Q Vinsa.
A Teresa was born and my mother said -- I mean, the husband was not known. I
knew the husband, because they used to sneak in the remainder of the house and I
understood there was something going on. Vinsa was very good to us. We loved her,
especially my brother. And my father said, take Teresa and go to Pusucamas (ph). You
know where Pusucamas? You don't know where that is. Pusucamas is when you right
on Scadniop (ph) now you know.
Q Okay. Yosweneuronos (ph). We'll look at this later. So she had to leave
your family?
A No, she says I cannot go back. __ It is illegitimate child. They will tear me to
pieces. We are a very strict catholic family. We don't want it. |§ And my mother felt
and my father, let her stay with us. Teresa will grow up together with our children
and this is what happened. But the mean children at school used to say how is Teresa
today. It was another thing. They came to see Teresa. She was crawling all over the

place. Made my father nervous. But my mother understood the situation. Wonderful.
She was born in Ricoholen (ph), in the Jewish hospital or in the private hospital it is
much more money.
Q Yeah.
A And this is a tiger I'm telling you.
Q Yeah.
A Why, you will understand ina minute. Look, she was to go with us for a walk
with us children. She was very religious. So, you know, the big cathedral in
Kaunas on Vilinus Venachos (ph) she used to take us there. We used to sit down and
make my lunch.
Q Signs of the cross.
A I mean, it is so similar because they say hallelujah. We all say hallelujah,
amen, of course. Amen is very -- we say 50 times, I mean, same thing as you say. But
one day when she came out of the thrufos (ph) just in the corner of Angos villios (ph) --
Q And he was shot?
A And he dared to do it. He was -- he was so nervous. I can -- I can
remember it. When you asked what do you remember?I remember. And I was never -- I
was a church, very close to the Neuman (ph). She took us there, too, sometimes. She
had a brother, Ritas (ph).

The brother was Hussar. You know what the Hussar 1s?
Q In the Czarist Army”?
A What?
Q A Hussar in the Czarist Army?
A No, they call it the Hussar in Lithuanian Army, too. There was a Calarasi.
Q That's a soldier.
A And a Hussar. He was -- it was like a commando unit.
Q Okay.
A Like my grandson is in the commando unit. It took -- he is a para trooper and
up until 18 he was -- he was pin drop (ph) and the minute he got his matura, he
was enlisted and then he went to para trooper for nine months. Terrible. He went to
training because the para trooper they are expected to be the Commander.
Q All right. So Vitas was a Hussar?
A Vitas was a Hussar. I don't know why I remember. Why do I make acknowledge
because I have Vitas 1s he was like a general.

Q In heaven, yeah.
A He came and then I think -- but they never went anywhere. They always sat in
the kitchen. It was -- there was things that belonged to classes that you don't go do that.
Q You don't mix in those ways.
A We, of course, he used to eat at the commons to stay and he had those sports, you
know, and you are right, your memories 1s beautiful. I look at that uniform nothing can
compare. Okay. But we are not to play with our soldiers, but defending. I'm so
happy now when I remember Vitas.
Q Okay.
A Yes, but -- but what happened later. Can we go on?
Q Absolutely if you want to say something please do.
A No. I mean, she was a second mother. And my little brother she was
everything for him. When we were shipped to the Ghetto, she wanted to take him. She
says, I'll save his life. It was clear what was going on. And my mother said, no,
whatever will be with us will be with him. She took Teresa. She went to the village.
She crawled through the holes and the ragging and a lot of food and she helped us to
going into the Ghetto.
Q So you are talking now about the time when you -- all the Jews of Kaunas were
ordered to go into the Ghetto in the summer of 1941, yeah?

A Iremember there. And that's it. And there is no more Vinsa. No more
Teresa. There was a Ghetto. This will talk later, but in '95,'91 when Lithuania
became independent, and my brother started to nudge me, I said, Dani, forget about tt.
I'm not going there. I don't want to see it. I don't want to go to Lithuania. __ Forget
it. He said, no, no, no, Vinsa is still alive. I want to see her.
Q Was she?
A No. So we went. We went. We came to Kaunas. It wasn't excitement.
Q It was what?
A Excitement. Such an extended. We landed in Vilinus. We come to Kaunas
and the very same night, that night we were running around into town because we knew
each and every street and it was like coming home in away And then I said to the guy,
they hada guide. __I[ said to the guide, do you know Pitsupukamos (ph)? He said, no.
But I look at the map at 12 o'clock and I know where itis. | Wecan go
ourselves. | We went and seen it. We sent Sanby (ph). It is a Pitsupukamos and
we came and there was a man was working in the fields. I said to
him, do you know Vinsa Bayono Skita?
Q What was her name, Bayono Skita?
A Of course, she was not married.
Q Right.

A This is really unfair. Why should they -- unmarried, okay, they have a present.
She is unmarried. And I did ask him where do you know Vinsa Bayona Skita? He
said, she is dead, but her daughter Teresa she lives here. Maybe they meet us. So the guy
goes in and says, do you know Uri and Dani Chanoch? They my brothers. They killed
everyone. Started to cry. Because Teresa was already attached. She lived
only on the memories, on the stories that her mother told her because they don't hold no
interest for them. They was in Cohost (ph), the Russians and the times that they
stay with the Cohost, this is the golden age. My mother never checked out with money,
take money and buy this, buy this. Ladies who checked out how much and then she
comes out and she sees us and she started to shout and to cry, are you alive? It was no
connection in those times. Only once I sent her an invitation when I marry Judy and she
was kept in captivity because Israel was --
Q Enemy country, right.
A And we have it on the video.
Q You have it on video. This meeting?
A My sister, no. Visit to her brother. My visit to her. My sister-in-law took a
photo, a camera and made 200 hours, 200 hours we made -- we made a movie, a movie.

A In spite of the thing that she was the professional or maybe because she was the
professional.
Q Is Teresa still alive?
A No, she died a year ago. But I contacted her. We had like family. And I'm also
with her two daughters in touch. Teresa and Vinsa came back and Vinsa became the
head of the village.
Q She became the head of the village, that's amazing.
A Why don't you ask why”?
Q Well, why”?
A Because the Germans needed food. So they went to the kymas (ph).
Q To the villages, yes.
A And they confiscated.
Q Yes.
A You had five pigs, they took the five pigs, but then they came to visit Kymas,
Teresa came over and spoke to them in Yiddish. They understood. They said in
Yiddish, don't take all the five pigs. Take two pigs. Leave us all something. She
communicated. Nobody could communicate. Nobody spoke Yiddish in Bucykamas (ph),
and she was very honored.
Q In spite of the fact that she had an illegitimate?

A In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period, the religion was not
anymore a dominant factor.I was really -- I was starting the story, I said, look something
good came out of it.
Q Yeah.
A Vinsa died from cancer five years before.
Q In 1990, if you went in '95.
A Yeah, in 1990 she died. — She had her grave and a tombstone is like a queen. She
-- and Teresa had two daughters Jolanta and Rasa.
Q Jolanta and Rasa.
A Yes.
Q So J-o-l-a-n-t-a and R-a-s-a.
A She also had a boy. I think, maybe it was Selima (ph) or something like this. They
both -- they both died by accident or by cars or by -- I don't know. They were drinking
toomuch. ‘This 1s a sickness there in Lithuania.
Q Oh, yeah, huge. It is huge.
A The drinking and I don't know what kind of a living Teresa made, a poor living,
but she was happy. When I make you understand because I used to come very often to
Lithuania, I tried to, to get some community property back, and there one day I came
with one of our ministers and we were sitting next to the opera and the mystic garden.

Q Oh, yeah.
A And we were having lunch and she said, I wish Stalin would come back.
Q Oh, yeah.
A So at least I had -- I went to Dachau. I had enough to eat. What they did to us
today, they gave us, okay, I supported it. It is not.
Q I know of that sentiment. I have heard it as well.
A Yes.
Q Yes.
A Then it was very shocking. All of this said, look. Life was organized. Okay. That was
a lot of stating and a lot of negative things and so on, so forth and encapida (ph).
Q Encapida is secret police.
A The secret police. I brought Teresa to Israel.

Q Oh, wo w.

Q I'dlove it. I'd love it.
A And now she is very religious. =I took her to Wailing Wall. I said you Pontius
Pilate and then here we are recohomo (ph) and here first station and the second station
and she doesn't react. She doesn't try to include. She had no idea what the first
station, second station, a cross is a cross, whenever she have a cross she hugged them and
kissed them.
Q But she had never gotten religious education?
A No.
Q Yeah.
A But, you know, there is Jesus and wise men by the things that Jews and this is it.
So I saw there was no use, no explaining about the Holy Sepulcher.
Q What are the stations of the cross, in other words?
A Separate cross.
Q No, that is an irony. If you were to explain to her what the stations of the cross and
she hadn't known what it was before. When you saw them, when you went to Lithuania

the first time and this 1s a question I would really like to ask at the very end. Did
something change in you in 1995?
A It was matter with me that change.
Q Because before you didn't want to go. And then you went and then after that
you went more. So something must have changed?
A There was more because I was asked to go. There is a different story. Ifyou
go back to the atrocities --
Q We haven't even gotten there yet.
A Yeah. It 1s -- you come back to a place where you were born and you like it.

The weather was good. It wasn't hot like here or anything, hot sometimes and
everything was good. Every morning we used to go with a couple at the inn.
Q To have some coffee.
A And butter and the milk and the school and the Dutcha (ph). I mean, it wasn't a
big family. _ We were normal middle class family and every year we went to grandma's
and this was the highlight of my life to go to the schitel (ph) and she came to pick us up
from the train with the local kutcher (ph), with the local guy that had --
Q A driver who had a carriage?

A Horse carriage and then for a week, the hostel was somehow connected. _It is
all dangerous because most of the people love her and I would ask Canuzum (ph) with
the father there was a difference. It was fun because --
Q Really.
A -- because we did the dishes, went together with the Gila (ph) conquer the almost
became as far as Turkey and there you saw the Karakash. Karakash are a Jewish sect
that believe only what 1s written with no interpretations. Maybe the other regions in
the Bavaria, this was after the expulsion from Spain they went to Turkey. And when
people saw the twitter this takes people.
Q This 1s medieval history.
A The situation could only improve. So they came, another couple of hundred people
and followed the Karakash. So, therefore, in this schitel I have a Sephardic name,
Sephardic name. [tis Enoch, not asa firstname. Enoch 1s the grandson of Adam
and Eve. The son of Cain, which is not a big thing. I think all of them, but --
but then you find German and you find durmichaven (ph) and donmeh, a lot of donmeh,
which 1s a lot of selanikli not covered, not covered lot of. So, of course, Bita (ph)
that came over Exkalzaday (ph). The schitel was, but my sister didn't go. Her mother
didn't let her. The air is not good enough for a girl.
Q The hygiene is not good enough.

A And we -- we used to fish and used to go to -- it was better than somehow, but this
was a pack problem between my mother and grandma, but between my father and
grandma and usually at the reunion for the schitel because many of them became
Palestinians and went to Palestine and out of four generations I also think and they make
getting things together and mainly they speak about Sara-Leah because she was such a
dominant personality and this Lila (ph), of course, was a dominant one.
Q So your grandmother and your uncle. —_I'm just saying that for the tape.
A Sara-Leah, Sara-Leah, Sara-Leah. So why -- but my little daughter says one that
was here, she works in York and she -- [love my grandma. Please, she has the name
Gaila (ph) give her all my grandmother's name, Sara-Leah. So, you know, that everybody
goes to the admils (ph) the girls. This is compulsive. You have to. So she sits there at
the crematorium camp and they call it Auschwitz, you know, and they said that -- then
they said Trina, Gallia, Sara-Leah, both of them, two girls knew that's three girls actually.
This is a joke.

Q: No? What were they?
A: They are cinemas.
Q: Ah.
A: And you own the cinemas.
Q: It's um, well that's also because I wasn't born there and I didn't grow up there. It's

A: -- first minute you are --
Q: We're covering a lot of -- I wanted to get a picture from you, about what your life
was like, who were the people who were important to you, what they were like, um, what
was that world like? Before all of the catastrophes, before everything changed. I wanted
to get this picture. And of course there is more to add to it and if -- as we go into um, the
war years, and the Holocaust and all of the -- all of the atrocities, if something comes to
you where you want to go back to describing something pre-war, that's fine. But I wanted
to get this kind of picture established so that somebody in the future has a sense of what it
was like before it all changed. And if you were born in 1928, you're still a child. When
things started to change. On the edge of being a teenager --
A: So you actually have a picture of how I grow up and what kind of a family I was and
what type of school I went.
Q: Yeah. Some kind -- yeah. Some of it.

question, very political question. Was there ant-Semitism when you were growing up?
Was -- Did you feel it? Did you experience it? Was it talked about?

A: I presume that it was, but I didn’t feel it. Smetona, issued a rule.

Q: Smetona was the president of the country?

A: Ina way, he wasn’t super democrat, but he was very good to the Jews. And he
needed the Jews badly. Because the Jews helped him to build a state with eh culture and
lots of the doctors are Jewish, the professors are Jewish and they mainly came from
Germany because it was not very far from Cannesberg (ph).

Q: That’s right.

A: And he always urged us to bring your relatives from Germany.

Q: And that’s through the ‘30s after Hitler came to power? Or even before?

A: Who came to power?

Q: Hitler came to power in 1933. Did Smetona say this after he came to power?

A: Yes.

Q: -- or before?

A: Before and after.

Q: Both times, okay.

A: Um Smetona (another language spoken) we used to go to his palace — palace.

Palestine in spite of the good life that they had. Look not everybody had the food and
there were many and there were two hundred settlers the life was —
Q: -- not so good.
A: But they also —I want you to very much read that book I may get you that book it’s
about four settlers and Kaisiadorys.
Q: Okay.
A: We- suddenly, when the war started, many Jewish people fled from Poland and
came and each and every family brought in somebody to live because they there were
quite a few but this 1s a habit of Jewish people someone comes over and would sleep over
a night and then stay and if they don’t have money they don’t pay. And now we are the
‘40s. And we, we, we, we didn’t move. We should have moved. But where can we
move? You cannot enter Palestine because the English don’t let us.
Q: I want to back up a little bit — I want to talk -- I want to get a sense as a ten-year-old,
eleven year-old child things start to change. I want to know how you experienced those
changes. Did you have a Polish, Jewish, family stay with you, for example, in Kaunas?
A: Yes. One. It was a single man.
Q: Did he tell you what was going on?
A: Yes. The kids are not involved. They say there is a war. But the kids — you still go
to school.
Q: Did your parents seem more worried?
A: They —I found out later, 1n Kaunas, our house the passports were ready.
Q: Their passports were prepared to go to Palestine?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection -
A: Yes. They wanted to go to Palestine, but how can you enter Palestine? If you don’t
have thousands pounds sterling for each and everybody and this was a hell of a lot of
money. You couldn’t enter. And even with a thousand pounds you couldn’t enter.
There was a limited --
A: But I think we’re going to go with America cause there was a grandfather. I don’t
know I don’t know the details. I don’t have the slightest clue. Before you say Jack
Robinson the Russians came.
Q: How did you experience that? Do you remember when they arrived?
A: Iremember like yesterday.
Q: What happened? What did you see?
A: I saw Plesney Plasky (ph), you speak Russian?
Q: (Russian spoken)
A: Came in a strong army and they went in the street it 1s after my (another language
spoken) were playing, and there was a lot of music, and a lot of joy. But my sister was
first here in university and the faculty of medicine but she said she’ll only be a
pharmacist. Never mind about that she couldn’t go on because she was not a Polital (ph).
I couldn’t be a Pioneer.
Q: You were the wrong class?
A: Yes. So and my father which minimized after had a business the little that he had, all
that it — he couldn’t-it has to be nationalized everything had to be nationalized. But the
biggest shock was they took away our Hebrew. And we were, I would say Israelis, we
were Hebrew kids and Hebrew was everything. Even the Lithuanian language was

a difference in Yiddish if it is uh 1f you write the same letters in Hebrew and Yiddish you
write the same letters in Hebrew, but the — for example “A” “E” just to give you an
example. In Hebrew, has three points, and in Yiddish it has a thing like this an “ine”. So—
Q: It changes?
A: -- So when they called me to the board — (another language spoken) He was cross
and said “What kind of a Jew are you, you cannot speak Yiddish. You cannot write
Yiddish” and I started to cry. It was kind of a joke no?
Q: Did your teachers change in school? Were there new teachers?
A: Uh Hebrew teachers. No one stayed. As I said we use to go to Smetona we use to
go that flag was the blue and white one and the Lithuanian flag were still flags how
tolerant he was. It was forbidden. To call me (another language spoken) or whatever I
could go and complain to the first policeman and he was forced to punish a boy. Or take
him to the Boka (ph) the day.
Q: The Boka (ph) 1s sort of a jail?
A: We knew it, we knew it, we — nobody touched us. Nobody did anything bad to us.
Maybe here and there (another language spoken). But it didn’t come to an extent of
hitting but maybe some other, boys and girls. But mainly not. It was not no. It was not —
I cannot tell and when the Russians came, everybody’s equal. And the Jews have the
same rights like everybody else but they had the same rights before too, they had even
better rights. It was a shock but we stayed in the same flat. The biggest shock
was that we couldn’t practice Hebrew anymore. So we did it —

A: Quietly, and in hiding. Because they were anti-Zionist, anti-Hebrew, anti, anti, anti,

A: But after three quarters of a year passed by and I started to be neglected. I’m not a

And I said yes.
Q: Palanga, P-A-L-A-N-G-A.
A: Yes. It is a resort.
Q: On the Baltic Sea.
A: SouhI go to Palanga and maybe after you finish the Chem there you’ll be a Pioneer.
And so I went to Palanga. It was tough, economically, because my father was not in good
shape. My mother hired a truck and sold little pieces of wood that you — it shows you
again my mother was organizing things. And then — oh, by the way Vincent (ph) stayed

were the army of the Bourgeois. I don’t know what they had in mind.

Q: Did—-

A: But half of my class, was shipped to Siberia. And maybe they would ship us too.
Which in maybe the class was — the two classes was 50, 60 people. Thirty and we have a
saying — I don’t see you well because of the light. But never mind. That’s better. They
said, “The rich man has the luck” Why? Because two weeks before the Germans came in
and they were shipped to Siberia it was very difficult to, 1t was very bad. A few people
died but it was still —

Q: -- better?

A: And in my class they all came back and all immigrated to Israel. They didn’t go to
America. So when we had our reunion and we were 50, five years ago, there were many
children there. Because if they were to stay there would be very few children, if at all. So

Q: Okay?
A: Your next-door-neighbor being sent to Siberia in the middle of the night have a little
valise and you go to the train, to Siberia.
Q: Are you talking about that night of deportation that happened in June in 1941?
A: Yes.
Q: That one.
A: You know in that deportation, not only Jews, all the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians
said only we were deported and all you Jewish people were not deported because you
were Communist and blah blah. A half-class minimum, more than a half class and they
came back. It was difficult.
Q: But one—were you in Palanga in June of 1941?
A: You know about Palanga was a camp.
Q: Ive heard of it. P’ve heard of it -- I know of somebody else who was in that camp.

Q: I know her from many years now, many many years. But that’s a side issue, let’s go
back to the interview?
A: Alec was in Palanga and never told me, I liked him. Very clever guy. And his wife.
Q: She lives in Lithuania. Um.
A: Palanga.

Q: Palanga. If you were —
A: -- 22nd of June. There’s an interesting thing. I don’t remember anything that
happened in Palanga.
Q: Do you remember how you got there? Your mother hired somebody to take you
there? Is that what you said? Or she hired —
A: --I don’t know.
Q: You don’t remember.
A: I don’t remember.
Q: You just know that you wanted to be a Pioneer but not excluded.
A: I knew Ibe a Pioneer but, but, but this only shows you what is brainwashing. After
two weeks I was willing to kill for Stalin, to die for Stalin, to jail my parents, to kill all
my uncles. (laughs) I mean, this is when you take a young boy and you brainwash, this 1s
crazy.
Q: Itis but you were also twelve years old, thirteen years old that’s the optimal age for
those things to happen.
A: Yeah.
Q: That’s the — you know, if you were 18 it wouldn’t happen quite like that.
A: You know the Arabs well now it’s quiet but ten years ago when they are asked to
commit suicide. I explain to people, what is brainwashing? Brainwashing 1s, is, [ am
brainwashing. I know what it is. They change you, they promise you 71 virgins in Allah.
Q: That’s right.
A: Allah will take care of you. This is brainwashing. And now the shock.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection <0
Q: Yeah and tell me about —
A: -- and why the shock.
Q: What happened, first of all?
A: Frist of all, they closed the border off Lemin and Clibida (ph) and they came in
motorcycles and bicycles and I don’t know what else.
Q: Can you tell me — do you remember how they looked?
A: Yes.
Q: How did they look?
A: The Germans?
Q: Yes.
A: Organized, fit, blitzkrieg, and the shock is, the Russians, the big Russians, the army
that’s after --. They ran, they left their shoes. They ran like crazy. They didn’t fight back.
And this is like we don’t need to fight back.
Q: So you were in this pioneer camp in Palanga, this resort on the Baltic Sea, the resort.
And what happened from one day to the next? Did the camp leaders leave? Did they
disappear?
A: Disappear.
Q: So all the children just left there?
A: Left there. Some of them succeeded with (Unintelligible) to go with them to Russia.
Q: Isee. About how many children were in that camp?
A: Many. Maybe thousands. Lot of children. And on the very same day, the
Lithuanians came, the Jewish children here, the non-Jewish children there.

Q: All of them had been pioneers before but they split them in two?
A: All of them were split. The Jewish children. We were put in a synagogue. Together
with women and children. The men were put in another synagogue. And put on fire.
This was the Lithuanians. They did.
Q: But was this — did they take the Jews of Palanga together with the children who were
in the camp?
A: Yes. Bravo.
Q: Okay.
A: The Jews of Palanga, and then the torture started.
Q: Where were you?
A: In the synagogue.
Q: You were in the synagogue? And so you saw it go up in flames?
A: The other one? No, the other one we didn’t see these people. Because the other one
was far away.
Q: Oh, so there were two synagogues?
A: Yes. Always two synagogues.
Q: But the one that went up —
A: The Jews say in this synagogue I don’t go.
Q: But the one that went up in flames, luckily you were not in that one. You were in the
other one?
A: No, no, no.
Q: Okay.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection _
A: No, I was considered already a big boy.
Q: So you went to the —
A: Only the men. The infants were with the mothers.
Q: So the men were in the synagogue that went up in flames? I see, okay. It was put on
fire, in other words.
A: And then the ceremony started. Take the Torah books, go with them, and they
shouted “hey,” they were watching us. Put in on fire.
Q: So this was the militia?
A: Why? What happening to our neighbors, to such an extent? I didn’t know that was
happening in Kaunas was much worse. They went from house to house. So, I don’t
know. Where are my parents? Where is my sister? Where is my little brother? Where is
Vincent (ph), where is Teraza (ph)? I will tell you something. Vincent (ph) and Teraza
(ph) were considered family. This is the same unit. It’s not something upstairs-
downstairs. We are sitting there in this synagogue about three weeks.
Q: About how many people were in it?
A: Tons. One hundred fifty. Terrible. We had no restrooms and we had hardly
something to eat. And every day it was a procession of the books. All the book in the
synagogue. We had to carry them and put them on fire. There was beating, there was
cursing.
Q: And was it Germans or was it Lithuanians or was it both?
A: The Germans were not there.
Q: Lithuanians.

A: They were busy. Blitz. We would go and one-and-a-half days Lithuania was — and
the soldiers would run away. I compare it sometimes with, of course, with the Arabs.
When they flee, they leave the shoes. They flee. They’re afraid of us.
Q: So they were —
A: They were afraid of us. Today, I don’t know. But don’t worry, we will settle it. We
know what to do. You know, what is the worst thing 1s the helpless, you are helpless.
There 1s nothing you can do. Suddenly there is nothing you can do. You can’t flee you
don’t know where to flee. You don’t know what happened to your parents. And to make
a long story short, a Lithuanian, a non-Jew, had good relationship with The Red Cross.
And he had a Jewish friend, and they sent three buses and we were shipped to another
place and never mind it’s a complicated—and the buses brought us to Kaunas.
And Vincent, (ph) my brother, came to fetch me from there was a Jewish center in
Kaunas where the orphanage was if you know, where it is, and the old people knows and
you can see it engraved there was The Ten Commandments. And then I have a very good
feeling. Because, if they were waiting for me maybe they would run away together with
the Russians. And many ran away. It was terrible.
Q: What did you see when you get back to Kaunas? What did you —?
A: Empty streets. People didn’t dare to go out. There were 14 thousand Jews and ten
thousand killed by Lithuanians in the first month. Killed. And the question is, why? And
sometimes I think that the factor of to rob us and to look for gold and diamonds and
things like this. Was also — or, 1t was somewhere, maybe, the organizist (ph) is maybe
because we Christ, we put Jesus on the cross. But no we didn’t put — the Romans put —

it’s crazy. It’s absolutely —
Q: What was your mother like? When you came home she must have been frightened
too because you were in Palanga and she didn’t know what was happening.
A: Ofcourse. My health, my father, my mother, didn’t turn out that Tereza (ph) told
me. They went from flat to flat. And their headquarters just in front of the watershed.
Q: And you lived on that square?
A: Yes. And they used to come very often. To look for the Jews. And she said they took
them away. She was hiding them under the bed, and in the cupboards. All kinds of
hiding places 1n the flat. So they had to look. She said “Me, I, they didn’t give it to me.
It’s me I took it. My little girl. And we are very happy they took them. Put on a plate.”
I didn’t know — I wouldn’t know it I would put name by the righteous, because she
risked her life. I don’t know if she is still alive but she she did not everybody did. Some
just turn in and she — we came to Pulsa Pukamas (ph), I’m shifting. And
Tereza (ph) took off the rings and said this is the ring my mother, your mother gave to
my mother.
Q: Aww. Oh dear.
A: I want you to have it. It’s a big ring it was a big ring. It was a white ring. She cut it
in three pieces and gave it to Teraza to me and her. And she said, “take all the furniture.”
Four years ago we had the furniture nice furniture. “Take everything,” she said. “We
won’t come back.” And no, I didn’t take it. What I took 1s a picture of me playing the
violin. I hated the violin. And we had lunch on our tablecloths.
Q: In 1995.

A: Ill show you the movie next time when I come.
Q: Yeah.
A: Are you in New York sometimes?
Q: Sometimes. Do you come to New York sometimes?
A: Icome every year.
Q: Okay.
A: I brought my (Unintelligible and laughs).
Q: Um?
A: Uh, this Iremember. The three of us, I went off the bus. I was very happy to be with
my family again. And we went home. And then we went into the ghetto.
Q: Tell me about that. How did that occur? What do you remember about going into
the ghetto?
A: When he came, with the carriage and the horse. And they put us in the ghetto. And
what the Germans did they said, “Now we are going to form a ghetto. And this is after
the war will be over then you will go back to your houses.” _I mean, they did everything
to avoid a revolution. How do you avoid revolutions? Drops of hope. Okay we’ll come
back. And so immediately there was an organized lot to make sure you are managing the
ghetto. And the police. And (other language spoken) which means, those who — we’ ll
give you four or five people we’ll give you one room. They gave us one room. The room
was a kitchen we had to share with another two or three families. If not the very
convenient the grown-up girl too, but it wasn’t the worst. This wasn’t the worst. This was
a Garden of Eden compared to the concentration camps.

Q: When you went to the ghetto, was it all five of you? Your father, your mother, and
your sister. And you had the one room? Did you have to go to work? Did your sister
have to go to work?
A: My sister had to go to work, my mother had to go to work. My father had to go to
work. And me all by myself not.
Q: Isee.
A: But, on the very same year, °41, in October 28, you know?
Q: Tell me anyway. Tell me.
A: They announced that all the people has to report to the democrata plats (ph).
Q: Okay. Democracy Square. (other language spoken)
A: Sometimes you really know names. And — the all of us did not know what to do.
Because they understood that something wrong was going to be here. They said, “What
do we do?” So a secular Jew, who doesn’t believe in God, goes to the rabbi. Go to the
rabbi and ask the rabbi what to do. Rabbi Shapiro. “Rabbi, what shall we do?” And they
say, “I need to look in the holy books. I can’t tell you — come later, come to our later.” I
said yes you have to report. And they said Elkes which was the head of the ghetto, said,
“uh, why, Rabbi Shapiro, do we have to report? Let them take me wherever they want.”
“No, but if we are organized maybe a few people will stay alive. And they will tell. What
they did to us.” So, here I am to tell you what they did to us. It 1s eh,5 o’clock in the
morning, 6 o’clock in the morning and there were two murderers Rauca and Jordan (ph).
Q: Ral and who?
A: Rauca and Yordon (ph).

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection _
Q: Rauca, R-a-u-c-a and Jordan, J, you got that?
A: I think there were forts (ph), there were Nazis. And they should stay feminist, and
they will stay home, we will kill them on the spot, which they did. And then they stick to
the left is the good side and the right 1s the bad side. And I look at my family and I say
they need walking partner. They can’t still walk. All right with all of us. Even for me, I
said. But what would they do with the little one? He 1s now spoiling the whole thing.
Because of him he’|l go to the bad side. But the police was the good side. Where the
establishment was, there was a good side and there was a bad side. All the other, mainly
women and children. And I said “Aye aye aye.” But when we same to Rauca (ph). I put
like this. Very tall family. My father was very tall. My mother was also tall woman. My
sister was tall. And even I was tall. To my age. At that time I —
Q: So with Danny, even though he was nine years old at that time you went to the good
side. Okay. I think we’ll change the card now. Yeah?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Are we ready?
Q: Yeah we’re ready. This is a continuation of the USHMM interview with Mr. Uri
Chanoch. Um so on that day, when you were, you know, to the right. You were saved.
A: Iwas to the left.
Q: Excuse me. To the left.
A: That’s all right.
Q: And so you remember that. Do you remember what Rauca looked like? And what
happened after that? How did your parents -- do you remember any details from that
day?

A: We were, I wouldn’t say happy but we were content in the good side and it was
heartbreaking. Because they took all of them there and cried and they stood there in the
little ghetto. They all were part of the ghetto. If you saw it. In the ghetto was a bridge.
We probably say it many times and they put them in the ghetto and from there, there was
already one action before. Dr. Elkas (ph) went back then please save this he wanted to
save and he was beaten. And then they, the very same day or the next day we say them
going up the hill to Fort Number Nine. You know where it is?
Q: Yes. But tell us what is Fort Number Nine?
A: Fort Number Nine is the killing spot for the Jewish people.
Q: In Kaunas.
A: Or maybe some none Jewish people as well. Fort was one the nine forts or ten forts
that surrounded Kaunas during the Russians built a — a kind of fort to protect and defend
Kaunas. And even today when you go and see, have you been? Have you seen the little
guns there?
Q: I don’t recall that. I’ve been there but I don’t recall that?
A: We have to go very, very down. The trenches were already ready. We saw them
going uphill. And they were shot on the very same day. And later on burned. This was
the big action because they needed the great action. The problem 1s there are less and
less people coming because the people are dying out.
Q: Yeah.
A: This is a sad day for us. A sad day for me. Because I saw it with my own eyes and I
heard it in my own ears, the shooting.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection <0
Q: You could hear the shooting?
A: Yes, there was a lot of shooting. It was again, women and children. There was very
little to do. What could they do? Nothing. Maybe some of them they put in the cells. In
Fort Number Nine. But when they killed, the German Jews and the French Jews, they,
put them in the cells first and then they killed them. There’s a story from one girl. She
lives here in New York somewhere. She says Jordan (ph) came, and rescued their family
because her mother was a seamstress. What happened then 1s fairly quiet years. It
doesn’t mean there were quiet years because people got shipped to Estonia. And for
work and _ then they were killed. And they were shipped to all kinds of to — Shancy (ph).
Q: Shansheay (ph)?
A: To Shawshea (ph). And there was a kind of a_ little camp so when they did make the
list, they — we didn’t know if it was better or worse. What would happen to the Jews?
But I, personally, understood that I have to belong to the establishment. And this will be
the policy. This will be my insurance policy for my family.
Q: By establishment, what do you mean?
A: Establishment is the police, the work office, and Unrat (ph). This 1s what we call
establishment. Maybe there is another word in English for it.
Q: Okay. How did you do that? In what way did you get yourself connected there?
A: I was asking maybe they need a messenger. And I knew the Jewish — I knew there
was a German S.R. Anda Jewish manager. So I wrote to him. And he said to come.
And the minute I got this thing that was written to get I but a messenger this was a life
insurance policy. Nobody can touch you. You are safe.

Q: Soit’sa 13-, 14 year-old boy?
A: T’ma messenger.
Q: You’re a messenger.
A: And I’m happy.
Q: What kind of messages did you take?
A: Bring this list to the Unrat (ph). Which was no, outside. Take this to the police and
we had a car to take and we called, and we use to write all the people in the ghetto, their
names and all kinds of things like that. The head of this was Gustav Hammon (ph).
Q: Hammon Gustov or Gustov Hammon’?
A: Youre right.
Q: Gustov Hammon.
A: You heard about him?
Q: No, as a matter of fact. I have heard of Hammon (ph). Which is different. Hamon
was with the Einsof Commando (ph) I believe.
A: That’s not that’s a different story.
Q: Okay. Press it on. Um this interview is being interrupted. This USHMM interview

Mr. Chanoch 1s describing to us what life was like in the ghetto. And how he um,
