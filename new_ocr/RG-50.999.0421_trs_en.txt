>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
My name is Bill Benson, | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for
joining us. We are in our 14th year of First Person. Our First Person today is Mr. Morris Rosen,
whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a
volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through mid August. The museum's
website at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Morris Rosen will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time, at the end of the program there
will be an opportunity for you to ask Morris a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Morris is one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.

We begin with a portrait of Morris Rosen, born Moniek Rozen, son of Jakub Rozen and Golda
Chaya Warszawski in 1922. Morris was born in Dabrowa Gornicza in Upper Silesia where his father
was an Official distributor of tobacco and acetylene. The arrow on the map of Poland points to the
location of Dabrowa.

Here we have a 1924 portrait of one of Morris' sisters, Rozia Rozen Bilauer, who survived in

the USSR during the war.

This photograph is of Morris and his friends on a hillside in Dabrowa. Morris is at the top.

As you will hear shortly, Morris survived several Nazi camps, then after a six-week forced
March he arrived in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. The arrow points to
Buchenwald.

Eventually, in 1945, Morris was liberated from the Theresienstadt camp in occupied
Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.

We close this brief slide presentation with a photograph of Morris with Regina Zilberstein,
about whom we shall hear more later.

Morris came to the United States in late 1949 and, following seven years of art school, built a
successful contracting business in Baltimore, where he continues to live today.

He is well-known as a stamp, postcard and letter collector, especially for his Holocaust postal
history collection including those from Nazi-created ghettos in Poland. He is also recognized
worldwide for his collection on the Olympics and has traveled and lectured about this collection as
part of the Olympic games. He has exhibited at numerous US and international exhibitions, including
in Nuremberg, Germany, and in Israel. | am pleased to share with you that today Morris is donating
to this museum several items from his collection of postcards, documents and correspondence from
camps and ghettos.

Morris speaks frequently about his Holocaust experience at such places as the headquarters
of the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the US
Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds and Fort Meade in Maryland. He also speaks to students at

numerous Baltimore-area schools and other locations.

Besides his volunteer work in this museum's archives, Morris has been a volunteer with the
Red Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center. He was named the
Baltimore-Washington, DC Man of the Year for the American Red Cross. Morris, who lost his wife in
2000, has two sons and two grandchildren.

Finally, | think you should know that in addition to his vigorous gardening that he continues,
Morris works out three times a week doing, are you ready for this, Zumba.
[Laughter]
Which combines Latin and international music with dance as an exercise program. However, his
doctors have ordered him to no longer go on his steep roof to clean gutters and do repairs.

With that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Morris Rosen.
[Applause]
Thank you for joining us.
>> Morris Rosen: Thank you for that introduction. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, it's
very difficult to condense five years of the darkest chapter in mankind history into 45 minutes.
Believe me, | would talk all day. But unfortunately, | have to skip many months, a year or two, but it's
impossible to do five years what | went through, which | remember every day of life in the camps.
Thank you.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Morris. And thank you for being willing to do this with us. Before we turn
to the war years and the Holocaust, tell us just a little bit about your family and your life before the war
began. Just a little bit.

>> Morris Rosen: Well, before the war | was well-known in school, because | was an athlete all the
time in school. Had many, many friends, not only Jewish friends, but gentile, we were very close.
But everything changed in 1938 during the crystal night in 1938. This was November 8, they started
boycotting our store also. Although it wasn't Poland, in southern Poland, Silesia. People that knew
us, students that | went to school with, they boycotted. | remember two sisters, they took a broom
from the store, started chasing away the ones that they told everybody, don't buy from Jews, this,
this, and that. It didn't help. We had to close up our store. That's what happened. It's a very short --
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father's business and what happened to it after Hitler came to
power in Germany.
>> Morris Rosen: Well, after Hitler came to power, it was very, very bad. First of all, you have to give
up everything. If it was radios, other things, valuables, people that they own stores for so many years
the Germans take over the stores. They closed up, and it was tough.

After 6:00 in the evening, they announce whoever is going to be caught on the street might get
shot or in prison. You couldn't walk any more than two or three people, the most. Not gathering, not
in the church, not to synagogue. It was very, very tough. It was restrictions, and then they made us
put off this was -- this was already in November 1939. They made us wear armbands on the left
hand, white armbands with the Jewish star. This is, if they needed any forced labor or to do any dirty
work when Germans moved in some places, we had to do the dirty work. It was very easy to
recognize the people. This was there.
>> Bill Benson: Let's go back a little to the actual beginning of the war, September 1, 1939. You
remember that?

>> Morris Rosen: Oh, yeah. It was about 5:00 in the morning. | was sleeping very sound. Suddenly,
| heard noises from airplanes, | look out the window. | mean, the sky was dark from the planes, over
60, what | count. They flew very, very low, and the reason they flew low, because they dropped the
fifth column, which they were dressed in civilian clothes. They were actually army people. They were
the ones that they let know the German army, with assistance from the Polish army, was safe to go,
where it's not safe to go. But the Polish army kept a lot of them, which they hung them in the woods.
They took off everything, except their underpants. This is shameful, because they were not soldiers;
they were just like private people, not army. They didn't wear the uniforms.

We started to run away also from our home, because we were very close to the German
border. We heard already the canons, bombardments and everything. We started running away.
Once you were expelled from Germany, from Hamburg to our city, but we run away. After about five
days, we were caught by the Germans near the river. That's when we started to be overcome.
>> Bill Benson: What did you find when you went back home?
>> Morris Rosen: So many Jews were already killed at that the. One was a good friend of ours. It
was rough. It was miserable. Food, you couldn't buy any food. There was a special place where
Jews can only buy bread in a certain bakery, a Jewish bakery. And you have to stay for hours in
order to get bread. | was all night long hidden in the little woods, and then to be the first one to be at
7:00 in the morning to stay at line.

| came out at 7:00 in the morning, it happened that a German battalion on the bikes came
over, wanted to keep order. One Polish guy, which he didn't belong to them, he said all the Jews. |

got kicked in the back. "You can eat the dirt. You get home, with no bread." | started crying, after
staying all night long. It was tough.
>> Bill Benson: Morris, you were at the start of the work in September 1938, October, you were not 7
years old.
>> Morris Rosen: No.
>> Bill Benson: One of the first things you were forced to do was help build a scaffold.
>> Morris Rosen: Yes. What happened, they formed a Jewish council. The Jewish council was
responsible for every order that the Germans gave, they have to do the dirty work. The Germans
didn't do the dirty work.

They started a Bauleitung, a construction company. You would be lucky to get in. | know my
father paid a lot of money. Why? First, we were more safe not to be sent to Germany. Second, you
got a little bit extra food. My first job | became a bricklayer, painter and carpenter. My first job was as
a helper carpenter to build hanging scaffolds in the market. | will never forget this. We did about 10
hanging scaffolds. It was scary. Then the police, German police, not soldiers, went from every
person they took away their IDs, you had to have IDs, otherwise you couldn't walk on the street.
You'd be 11:00 at the market, you get back. Otherwise, you don't get back your ID.

It happened the next day, | saw it myself. They brought 10 -- at the foundry, before the war
they made all of the locomotives for Poland. During the war they made parts for planes. Motors for
planes for the Germans. They brought 10, and one of them they did sabotage, that's the reason.
This is not right. They didn't do anything. They did in every city in Silesia. They hung people for

sabotage which people didn't do, just to scare of the people. That's why they were successful,
because they murdered, they killed and people were scared. That's what happened.
>> Bill Benson: Morris, about that time, | think your sister Rozia, who we saw a picture of, she
escaped to Russia.
>> Morris Rosen: What happened, she lived in Bedzin, which was 65% Jewish people. When the
Germans came in about a week later, they burned the synagogue there. When they burned the
synagogues, the rabbi wanted to save the holy scriptures. They pushed them into the synagogue.
People were watching, because it was like a Jewish city, everybody was pushed in there to the
synagogue, and they put fire to the synagogue.

Next to it was a church there. The priest from the church opened the gates, metal, he pointed
out to people that they looked out the window. Several did, about 12 people jumped down. He
unlocked the gate, they were safe. Then the Germans went house by house, chase out the Jews,
then the synagogue. Machine-gunned it. One of it, | met in Israel, | exhibited in Israel my stamp
collection of the Olympics, and | talked also about it, what happened at the ghetto. Said, you want to
meet somebody that was right there? You come to the meeting. He picked me up, went there to the
meeting, which is from my region, from Silesia, the room was full from papers from the priest that
saved the Jews. He was one that chased out from the house, and he was shot, but he managed to
run into the church there. The priest locked the door, and he showed me a bullet hole here. He was
treated, but | took pictures, if | told the story, of the man that actually survived this and lived through.
>> Bill Benson: Your sister went to Russia?

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Morris Rosen: My sister when she saw hanging Jews, 35 Jews hung in the market, after the
synagogue was burned, she came home, said goodbye to my father, her husband, said I'm going.
Because the Russians at that time were in good things with the Germans, because they signed a
pact. She managed to escape. She swam through the river to Russia. Some of them, the Russians
sent back. She was lucky with her husband. About four weeks later, we received the first postcard, |
remember the stamp has a horse that | collected stamps as a youngster. She walked -- she never
knew Russian all the time. She walked in a bank, and then she escaped further when the war broke
out. It's along story. Bult it's not her story, it's mine.
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: You were a bricklayer for a while.
>> Morris Rosen: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Assistant carpenter. But before long, you were forced to become a painter. That
would play a really important role in your survival.
>> Morris Rosen: In the ghetto | worked painting. The Germans sent me away. In fact, every Friday
evening | walked to three buildings for the Germans, which was a police state. In the third building,
unfinished yet, paint and everything. Every Friday my older brother, myself, went through the woods,
which was about 20 kilometers through the woods, and to be there Friday evening, this was the
safest place. Even | have such a good ID card sometimes it didn't help.

So | was hiding at the police station. This was the safest place. But the war soon came, which
| have to skip also. It was March 1942 that they called all of the Jewish girls in our city from 12 years
old to 30 to register, that they're going to work in the shop for the Germans as tailors, and they should

come register. Whoever won't register won't get any food stamps or anything.

They came there to the place, to Chemnitz, which was a transition camp, and they were
examined by a doctor. They didn't let them out no more. My father went there, tried to get out. Didn't
help anything.

Two days later, they shipped them away. Let me tell you, my house was like after a funeral.
Can you imagine a 12-year-old girl, the youngest, to be taken away. My mother cried constantly. My
father. It was like after a funeral. It was terrible. Till about three weeks later, we got the first postcard
from her that she works in lower Silesia, in a camp, in a factory where they make clothing and
everything, 12 hours a day, if it's possible to send some packages of food. So we knew they're
hungry.

My mother baked everything she could. | could go to the post office. Though it was restricted.
It was already in our city, the ghetto, which you couldn't go everywhere. We were still not in the
ghetto. And | went to the post office and mailed those packages all the time. But the war thing
happened, | never forget, was August 10, 1942. There came an order from the Jewish community,
9:00 in the morning, we have to come near the Jewish community there was a stadium, to be there at
59:00 in the morning. Put on your summer clothing, so you look presentable. There you will get new
ID cards.

We waited till 8:00 in the morning. It was so hot, August, the hottest season in Poland. Kids
were crying. Of course, they were thirsty, no water, no nothing. People were fainting from the heat.
7:00, 8:00 in the morning | thought something is not kosher like, to say. Came three cops with SS
and soldiers. On the roof were already soldiers with machine guns. Something smells. | saw it is not

right.

At that time, | walked as a -- worked as a painter, but the head of all of the gestapo in Silesia,
Dreier, | did painting for him. My father too. We came in the morning. They put up three tables.
There came a selection. The one, the elder people, over 40, some people younger, but they have
beards, you know, go to the right. To the center were people that haven't got IDs, young people, but
they're still able to work. Went to the center. The left is like people like my brothers and I, that we
have ID cards, we work for the Germans, to the left.

About 10:00, they finish, they march all the people, about 2,000 of them, to Bedzin, next city.

| didn't know where to go in, because my father didn't keep them in our home. | found out
where they were in Bedzin, so at 8:00 in the morning | went there to see my parents if | can get first
the key to the house. Who was there? Jewish police, not German. They didn't let me in. What do
you want? | knew a policeman from our city. | said | just want for a second. | am there for a minute, |
come back out.

The scene | was there, crying, | will never forget in my life. | saw my father, gave me his keys,
his pocket watch. My mother said don't forget your younger sister, 12 years old. See to send the
packages. See that she gets the best. That's the last time | saw my parents.

| came back to work there, | told him you promised me my parents would be safe.

Oh, don't worry. | find them. Like you found them, like he did.

On the third day, | went back from work, | worked with my older brother, | walked through the
fields, not the city. | see somebody wave to me like this. It was my friend's father, my best friend's
father. | said this is the transport. German soldiers are there, on the roof, on the outside. As | wave,

suddenly a German started shooting. So | jumped in there, waited 10 minutes. When | didn't see the
train anymore, | went home.

Went home, the next day | get from the Jewish community we have to move to the ghetto. We
didn't even have time to cry after my parents. You were busy moving. What can you move? We
didn't have horse and wagon or anything. We got a little two-wheeler. What did we pack? Some
bedding. We took my father's library, because he has a very well-known library, books, Jewish books
on history from the 17th century, 18th. This | took. What can you take? The rest, everything we left.
We came back to the ghetto. We were 16 people, nine girls, seven boys. Just hay on the floor,
wooden floor. We let the girls sleep there. We went to sleep outside. When it rained, we stood in the
foyer like this.

There was one lady, she was pregnant, she begged me, she baked something for her husband
in a forced labor camp. This is important to you when | tell you later the story. He was our tailor that
actually for my bar mitzvah, if you Know what it is, he did my suit. He was our tailor from home.

To him | sent the packages. And then came the high holidays about a week later, we went to
the cafe, everybody cried. After that, | have a friend. We were five people, very good friends. One of
them was very poor. He didn't have no parents. He had the elder brother that went to the Polish
army. He didn't come back. He probably got killed.

He was so hungry, he didn't have food to live. That he went as a volunteer to the slave labor.

So we put some money together. | went and bought some on the black market, some beer,
some kielbasa, good good oils, went to a garden there to someone's, we had a little party there, and
that man that was so poor, he was so talented, he was a good singer. Every time he saw a picture

with Fred Astaire, he did step dancing, like, like Fred Astaire. | never met him after the war. | have
pictures of him.

Then | came home, | have a letter from the Jewish community that this gets you on the special
permit, they sent me to a leather factory. There we were about eight months. After eight months,
they were only in the factory two Jews. One was the chief engineer for leather that he knows what to
do everything, a scientist. The other one that knew the motors. That man, one of them went to
Bedzin to see his brother. Never came back. They caught him, he never came back. He left his wife
and little child.

About a week later, we got the food from the Jewish community. | heard there was no more
Jews there, it was clean of Jews. | thought | might escape, because | came, went by a church,
somebody whistled. It was a Jewish guy. He says come with the bread. | said no, the people won't
have anything to eat. The next morning, 6:00, who comes in? SS with the truck. They took us all
then. But one, a friend of mine, an electrician that used to go with me, he must have escaped
through a window, but | never heard him after the war. | don't know if he made it or not.

There was a lady, the wife of the engineer with the little baby, who we saw. | held the baby
going to the train, and when we arrived, | gave back the baby, lucky me. Right away, the SS came
for her in the private car, took away the baby. If | would hold the baby, | would go with her, because |
am her husband. They took them to Auschwitz. We didn't know at the time what Auschwitz meant.
We were the ones cleaning out the ghettos, because no more Jews were there. Mountains of shoes
and leather, bedding to separate, this to separate.

On the third day, we stood at the guard going to the ghetto. Here comes Ludwig. Ludwig was

Then | came myself, | said | don't have no paint. | have no brushes. If you let me go home, it's

me a glass of water, anything. Silently, what kind of Polish woman, knows I'm hungry, she knows I'm

later, they took us in trucks, went to a concentration camp. We couldn't eat with the women no more,
because the women's camp, the slave labor, everything in 1944 became concentration camp. No
more slave camps. They were attached to it. We come there about three hours later, we come in the
woods with the trucks, snow, dirt, it was in March, cold as can be.

As we arrive --

ground. Unbelievable. We stood there. Till late in the evening, 10:00.

Then you go into the camp. What happened? Our bunk wasn't finished yet. The cement was
wet, no windows, no water. Just a bucket to relieve yourself. You can't go out.

What did | do? | saved some pictures. | knew where they put them in our suitcases. One of
the pictures from home. Especially | have my first love, like you say girlfriend, when you are 15 years
old. | have a picture from her. | says I'm not going to lose this picture.

| got 2:00 in the morning, it was pouring, no electricity, so | wasn't afraid to jump over the
fence. Went to the back where there was my suitcase, knocked out a window. Nobody there. Took
me an hour to find my suitcase, took out the pictures and went back to the back. | have like a metal

with cement, piece of paper wrapped around that has plastic, the cement.
>> Bill Benson: You buried your photographs?

OK, | have the worst job there. We were a company about 50 people and cutting down trees,

>> Morris Rosen: | gave it up, because | couldn't breathe anything. If you want to help me out, the
food won't help me. Get me out from that job, because the smoke kills me. 12 hours a day. You

anymore, | became a painter.

When we stood there at roll call, it was off. We stood six blocks. Every block has about over
500, 600 people. When you stay in the front it was a long row, five deep. The one at the front all the
time had beating. The one with the scar. You don't stay straight. Your head is crooked. It was

were standing there with everybody, with the cabinets open, with food plenty. Wounded soldiers got
out, and we helped ourselves. We ate butter and bread. Not butter and butter. We have so much
food. Even chocolate there. You name it. Everything.

pajamas. That was the clothing. He organized another pair of pants. | gave him all of my food,
another one | helped. But it was miserable. Every day we -- every block had the dead people. 25 to
30, 40 people dead. Because they worked them to death, with 600 calories, 12-14 hours a day.
Beating, every day. Roll call and cold, to stay with nothing, you were shivering, till them came to
count. They have to count. One day three people escaped. Not going back. Every 10th person is
shot, unless we found them. Two days later, two of them they found. They brought them back. One
was a good friend of mine. He was in Gruenberg with me. His sister was there also. They put black
things, like clothing, and they got such a beating you didn't see the eyes. On the third day they took
him, from the main camp, they hung them there, brought them back. They laid on the ground. That's
how we're going to look if you try to escape. The third one they didn't catch, which | met him, in 1982
in Los Angeles, he managed to go into a metal purse, that he knows metals. He walked there. He
had papers. He lived through the war.

>> Morris Rosen: What happened, February 5, | never forget. We don't go to work. We heard that
the Russian Army was there. Didn't go to work. Everybody take your blankets, and everybody got a
loaf of bread with marmalade in a can, we started marching, in the woods. Eight hours.

We came out from the woods where German soldiers, they were retreating. One of the
officers, why don't you let them go, to the head of the SS that led us? Don't you see the war is almost
over? We're retreating. Let them go. The war is almost over.

No, he has other things. He took us back to the woods. We marched another eight hours.
People can't walk that long. Whoever couldn't walk, a bullet in the head. We go again. We didn't
wash for two weeks. It was so cold, in February --
>> Bill Benson: This was an especially brutal winter too?
>> Morris Rosen: My God, the winter. We got undressed, everybody going into the river to wash
themselves. Can you imagine? And wash your clothing. It was full of lice. If you don't wash, one
sleeps with the other one, we slept first in the barn. The farmer had food for the horses, the pigs, we
ate everything up. People were hungry. You didn't get any food, just a potato a day, that's all.

So punishment, we slept in the snow. One on top of the other to keep warm. So we washed
ourselves, then we get dressed. | was with a nice bunch, youngsters, about five people. We jumped

Hungarian platoon, SS Hungarian platoon. They worked with the Germans. | worked in the front with
the doctor, what a beautiful person. Intelligent person. He saw the person they helped out, they were
poor, the father worked in the bakery --
>> Bill Benson: Helped him before the war?
>> Morris Rosen: Before the war. Never took a penny from them. He gave him medicine.
Sometimes money to buy the medicine. He ran over "Don't you know me?"

He knew who he was. He says that's when you have friends, you help them out, what pay did you
get back? | tell you, then | had a friend that was a Baker, Jewish Baker during the war. He was older
than me, because so many people died, so they brought a transport from Auschwitz to supply more
labor. Who came? One, a friend of my brother, elder man, who was in Auschwitz. He gave me the
first greetings that the two brothers are alive in Auschwitz. And he looked terrible, like a skeleton. He
told me what happened in Auschwitz, that they burned people. Then | found out what Auschwitz
meant. | didn't know. Nobody knew. He told us a horror story. The SS, the stump from the

>> Bill Benson: Morris, in the time that we have left, tell us, eventually the march took you to
Buchenwald.
>> Morris Rosen: The march took us to Buchenwald. What happened, we came to Buchenwald,
uphill, we can hardly walk, with no food, no nothing. He was the one that killed the two guys and
killed so many people. Like a soldier, he walked left and right, he wanted to show off who he was.
When we came to the gate there, who was at the gate? Germans, that they were couples, elders,
political prisoners, communists and socialists. When they saw what he did to Jews, they grabbed
him: Are you any better than they are? They threw him to the ground. He had a beating. He was
bleeding all over.

My God, we have God to punish him. We was lucky they kept him long enough we went
inside. They gave us -- it's a whole story, because it's not much time. But anyway, the next day
somebody noticed and they tore away his clothing, he was afraid we would kill him. He took probably
from a dead person his uniform, put it out, but he managed to escape not where we are. | was all the
time like for history. It smelled to high heaven. | looked, there were mountains of dead, six
mountains about eight feet high with all dead people that they -- the high heavens smelled.

| walked over there, who was on the top? Morris, Morris, one eye open, one closed. He was a
German Jew. They sent him to Poland because his grandparents were from Poland. We played
Ping-Pong in the Maccabiah club. He was at my camp. He had it nice. He did nothing. He was so
good. He had a lot of food. On the death march, they were the ones that didn't survive. The same

knew the hunger. They didn't know. They couldn't take it. He later, oh, you would be soon.

Then | saw cannibalism for the first time in my life. | never saw this in my life again. People
with two knives, tall guys, dark-skinned. People are still alive. What are you doing, you murderers?
They started telling me. | run away. | ran away, they start yelling all the Jews out. They started
phasing out all of the Jews from there, because the Americans were already very close by. We didn't
know, but that's what happened.

| didn't go. | said, no, I'm not going to another death march or something. | saw one guy, |
went into the wall, a hollow wall in the back, | ran in there for about an hour. Then some other people
came, they noticed. They started machine-gunning the wall. | managed to get out, knocked out the
window with my back, which | bloodied myself. | ran right out. | saw the people there staying out. |
ran to them, they should see me. We'll be shot, because they killed everybody running from that wall.
This was the last transport getting out. If | would have stayed another day, | would be liberated by the
Americans. Instead, | suffered another two weeks.

We went all the way to another station, because there was no station in Buchenwald. Hungry,
some people barefooted, wooden shoes and pajamas. It was full of glass, because what they
bombed, it wasn't the house there with glass.

We went to the woods, cold as can be. Didn't have a place to sit. During the night, we started
pulling out dead bodies. It came so bad, on the fourth day it was only 1/4 of the people left who went
out. We didn't pull out the bodies. We put them as pillows, because it was very cold to lay down. No
food. For nine days, no water, no food. Suddenly, we come to Gera, we see water from the

What happened, two Russian planes came every five minutes for about a minute to check on
the locomotives, we were not the only one, about 10 ina row. One got wounded. We jumped off the
train, ran away. The soldiers there let us in. As we go back, | noticed a young boy from my city. He
was only about 14. Oh, Morris, come. They don't know I'm Jewish.

| says no. So far I'm lucky. | stay. You come with me.

| didn't go. | found out later on they took all of the Poles into the woods where we escaped,
they shot them all.

Finally, we walked in the woods, we walked on foot, we went to Dresden. | don't know if you

>> Bill Benson: In Dresden?
>> Morris Rosen: He punished them, what we went through in the Elbe River. OK, we come there in
the night, they didn't know where to put us. All over Germany, they're supposed to kill us off there.
But what actually happened was a German officer let Know that they meant to kill us. So the Russian
Army said go first, they came around, and they came to Theresienstadt, that's why we're safe. They
came the next day, they took off my clothing, they burned everything, it was full of lice. And they
gave me two shirts with a pair of pants, the same shoes what | had, no socks or anything, and we
were about 32 in the back to Hamburg. We were there, and | don't know what happened, | only know

There must be one, a couple there, who was healthy, hefty, he came with a pair of Belgium
horses, the big ones, full of wine and the sardine, the Portuguese sardines, the best. And thousands
and thousands and thousands, hundred Mark bills that he went to a bank there.

We put the money on hooks, because we didn't have toilet paper. We used it. | wish | would
have known. | would be rich. The money was still good for two years.

So we ate there. On the third day came a nurse, a Czech nurse. Took us to the doctor. The
doctor asked me what did you eat? | said all day wine and sardines. He said you're lucky, if not the
wine, you wouldn't be here, the sardines would kill you. In Theresienstadt, there were so many
people killed, which the Russians killed them. What happened, they came in with the same kitchen,
what the soldiers ate, with beef and cow and potatoes. People didn't eat for 2-3 weeks, their
stomachs were shrunk. They killed them with that food.

Lucky me, | only ate a potato and a piece of bread. | didn't want to touch their food. | was
smart enough. | don't know why. | thought about it. | was sane. | knew what I'm doing. Then
suddenly, on the fourth day | hear somebody calls my name. My sister's husband heard on the radio
that I'm alive. Because in Europe every night between 10:00 and 12:00 the Red Cross put out names
from each camp who was alive here, in Budapest I'm alive. He came. He got me out from there.

escape with my other sister, but they won't say goodbye to my father. When they started going back,
they were killed. There were 12 kills. They were killed with axes and shovels by the Ukraines. | had
a witness who saw it. A neighbor who moved away. They got killed there.

| have another sister that was -- there were four girls, she was with a 2-year-old boy with her
husband. Her husband went to dynamite a train, this was near Krakow, when the train went to the
east. When he came back he saw all of the four Jewish girls cut their toes and stomachs. But the
little boy wasn't hurt, but bloody from my sister. He grabbed the baby, ran away right away, washed it
off, put it in Krakow near an nunnery where the nuns he knew were there. He left to the house
looking out for the windows from the third floor. After half-hour, the baby was crying. Some nun
came out, grabbed the baby, then he escaped.

He escaped back where he came from. He joined the communists on the ground with the
Russian soldiers also, in the underground. When the Russians came in, in 1945, to Lemberg, he had
a brother in the Polish army, which started at that time, he says any POW wants to join us fighting the
Germans will be free. So he joined, he came right away to his own home. He saw his brother, my
sister's husband. He told them what happened to my sister, that the kid was alive. They went toa
restaurant to eat. Came in, the Russian officer saw my brother-in-law in civilian clothing. Killed him.
Because he was not in uniform, he doesn't belong there.

No, | saved him, | spent money, he's my son. | don't have kids. He says, but I'm his uncle. He

Didn't help. Next day he came with two Jewish guys from the Russian Army, also from Poland,
they put on a full table money, they didn't want to touch it. They grabbed the money, they ran away,
they tore away their uniforms, in civilian clothing, ran over the Italian border and went to Palestine.
After the war, my only sister that escaped, she was in Jerusalem, she went to court because she
wanted the baby. No, he risked his life, so they gave it to him.

element pretty bad, because they killed a lot of people in the city, | know it.

Maybe from there we go to Palestine.

So he told me when you're on the train, when the Americans come up don't you tell them
you're from Poland, they'll send you back to Poland. Tell them you're a German Jew, you go back to
German.

We come on the train. His son was on the train too. We come to the border, came up, the
American Gl. That's impossible. With ties, with elegant shoes, with the MP, they looked so
handsome. This is not soldiers.

My nephew, only 16 years old, started talking English, better English than they did, the British
English. He spoke French. They had a housekeeper, a French lady, spoke with them only French
and English. So they knew better probably than Polish. Spoke several languages. Also Lithuanian,
because he escaped from Lithuania right away.

They took them as spies.
>> Bill Benson: The Americans thought he was a spy because his English was so good?
>> Morris Rosen: Right, because English was so good, they're spies. You go, we find you. Next
day, | get off the station in Pilsner. | see American soldiers there. I'm cold, dirty, tired. They see from
the ground bags covered. | keep the cover to me. | fell asleep. | woke up, I'm the only one on the

Polish, I'm hungry, I'm from the camp. They say don't say you're Polish. Tell them you are a Jew
from Poland. They hated the Poles.

Why? In 1938 when the Germans occupied all parts from Czechoslovakia then Prague, so
Poland went to war, because they claimed Szczakowa belonged to Poland. They hated the Poles.

questions of Morris. If you want to, please do it. Meet him, say hi to him, get your picture taken with
him or ask him any questions you want. That will be OK?

future of our country. Please be kind to everyone. It doesn't make any difference if you're black,
yellow, white, what religion, if you're Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Jewish, we all are God's children. You
