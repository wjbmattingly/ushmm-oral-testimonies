A: Yes. Wistoki. [ph]
Q: And do you know when he was born? It’s ok 1f you don’t.

Q: In Romania?
A: Yeah.
Q: Your mother’s name?
A: Helena Rubinstein and she was a first cousin to Helena Rubinstein. So that’s the family
background.
Q: And was your mother also born in the same town your father was?
A: No, no, no. My mother was well you know these, these Jewish birthplaces, they kind of
change because the Rubinsteins were all born in a little itty bitty village called Myelitz [ph|
which nobody acknowledges. It’s a suburb of Talnuf [ph[ which nobody acknowledges, which
is a suburb of Krakow, which everybody acknowledges.
Q: And do you know when she was born or not?
A: Not. Well wait a minute. Her older brother was 40, her older brother died in 1947 and was 65

October 14, 2010
A: Well see it wasn’t Romania then. It was the Austrian-Hungarian empire. They were both
living under Kaiser Franz Joseph. And they remember the historical connections 1s, whatever
you call the stratification.
Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?
A: I had two half-sisters.
Q: Two half-sisters?
A: Yes.
Q: Because one of your parents had been married before or —
A: I. My father’s first wife died in childbirth. You know back in the olden days when and so I
had that half-sister. And then my mother well anyway, then there was another one and then there
came me. So we were three half-sisters.
Q: What kind of work did your father do?
A: He was a furrier. In Leipzig Germany, everybody was a furrier.
Q: What brought them to Leipzig?
A: Actually it was interesting. My father initially was sent to Leipzig from Romania, a city
called Wistoki where the family owned wooded, many forests. And a saw mill. And he was sent
to Germany to sell the lumber. And stayed. And then got into, because everybody in Leipzig had
something to do with fur. He drifted into the fur business.
Q: And was he successful?

October 14, 2010
A: Fair. I mean considering that most of this was the depression, nobody was that—but ok.
Q: Were your parents very religious?
A: Modern orthodox. In fact you might even have heard of this. Leipzig had a very famous
rabbinical family, the Kalmbach [ph]. You probably heard of Shlomo. Well Kalmbach was my
school principal. I went to Kalmbach’s private school. And he was my school principal. And
one of my classmates was Shlomo’s cousin. And I was very close to the Kalmbach children.
Q: What was the first name of the principal. Do you know? That’s ok.
A: It’s been a long time.
Q: Just a few years. So you said your parents were modern Orthodox. You went to this Jewish
school, Kalmbach school.
A: Yes and Kalmbach was our family rabbi. He had the modern Orthodox synagogue in Leipzig,
the big —
Q: There was a big one?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Do you remember the name of it?
A: I think it was referred to as the Kalmbach schul.
Q: Were your parents Zionists? At the time?
A: My father was. My mother was not, figure that one out.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 7
October 14, 2010
Q: How did that manifest with him? Did he speak about —
A: Well, I guess he always wanted to go to Israel and never did. Or Palestine. And my mother
always had her eyes set on the United States. She never made it but she, she had three brothers in
Seattle, Washington. And if it hadn’t been December 7 killed it all. No, they —
Q: Once we went to war you mean.
A: They had papers to go to Cuba. Legal, I mean valid papers. They were purchased but they
were for real and if December 7 hadn’t happened. Ok because of the American immigration
quota system, my father was number 34 on the list to come to the States. So there’s only one
thing nobody told you. The Romanian, Romania only got two visas a year. So being number 34
meant a 17 year wait.
Q: So he was still considered Romanian even though he lived in Leipzig.
A: That’s right.
Q: And your mother also was considered Romanian?
A: Yeah because she, we only—you know the family passport was Romanian passport.
Q: Even though you were living in Germany. Ok. Let’s talk about you as a young child now that
we’ ve talked about your family. You went to --
A: I was very precocious. I was a snot nosed kid. But I was bright. In fact it’s kind of
interesting because when I was six years old somebody took me to some Zionist meeting. It was
sort of a commemoration of somebody who was a hero. Joseph Trumpeldor who died, da, da,
da and here is this little six year old and she says well what’s so great about dying for your

country. Isn’t it more important to live for it. And I thought that was a pretty astute comment
from a six year old. Me.
Q: How did the teacher answer that?
A: It wasn’t a teacher. It was a youth group. Very, they were quite impressed. As I say I was a
kind of a bright snot nosed kid. I don’t think I was quite as smart as I thought I was. But I was
fairly bright. Which has stood me in good stead over the years. In fact I guess growing up when
I did I grew up sort of confrontational and I think it stood me well all my life. I like to say I’ve
never been aggressive but I’ve always been assertive. Fine distinction but a good one.
Q: What’s the distinction?
A: That when you are aggressive you hold things, you have boundaries. It’s not all free floating.
As aggression can fly in every direction. Assertiveness is focused. At least to me that was the
distinction.
Q: You went to school. Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood? Was your house in a Jewish
neighborhood in Leipzig?
A: No it was a mixed neighborhood.
Q: So did you have friends who were not Jewish?
A: Yes, yes we did. Actually you probably wouldn’t know about this but there used to be a very
famous German encyclopedia called Brachhaus [ph]. You know it’s, take my word for it. It was
very famous. And the Brachhaus family lived across the street from us and Leipzig of course
was a publishing city. And very few people know that but you know the, not pocketbooks but
paper backs, quality paperbacks were published in Leipzig long before the, the names were
coined. Because we had these publishing houses in Leipzig and boy I had a whole collection of
English novels that I read by the time I was ten years old.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 9
October 14, 2010
Q: So you were able to speak English?
A: Yeah.
Q: How did you learn that? in school?
A: Leipzig being a city that had fairs also had language institutes where they trained translators
and interpreters and it was a three month course and you kind of lived, I mean I didn’t have to
live at the school because I was from Leipzig, but most students lived there. And it was
immersion study.
You had breakfast with your teachers. You went for a walk. You couldn’t use anything but
English. If you couldn’t say it in English, you couldn’t say it. It was agony while it lasted.
However, when I came to the States as an immigrant, I didn’t have to take a single required
English college course. I passed every single college course, high school and college entrance
by exam.
The only thing I couldn’t pass was Shakespeare.
Q: What other languages did you speak, did you know besides German and English?
A: Well I spoke a little Hebrew. And English and French. From school. Still speak a little
French.
Q: What were your other interests as a child?
A: Mostly reading. No I wasn’t too much into sports because I was very near sighted as a kid
and in those days we didn’t have plastic glasses, so you know I couldn’t go in for sports.
Q: Cause they would break

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 10
October 14, 2010
A: Because my glasses would you know a tennis ball in a pair of eyeglasses can be fatal. So I
kind of was a little bit removed from sports and tended towards books.
Q: Were you very close to your parents. What kind of relationship did you have with them?
A: I was much closer to my mother. Yeah I had a, we had a good relationship. I think my dad
was a little bit of a control freak, but then I guess most parents were in those days.
Q: Your two sisters, what were their names?
A: One was Clara and one was Miriam.
Q: Were you close to them?
A: Well no because they were much older—they were close to each other. Well one of them I
was fairly close to and in fact the one that ended her life in Israel, I actually went and spent six
months with her in Beersheba before she died. She was quite, well she, she ended up with
Alzheimer’s. But that’s all right. I mean she was a nice person. And she had, she had good, she
had had a good husband and family so she was well taken care of. And I spent six months
helping her. And things worked out ok.
Q: To get back to your childhood. You said you were very independent, it sounds like you were
very independent and doing what you thought you should be doing.
A: Well yeah because one of, part of the independent bit was as kids we belonged to a Jewish
youth group. And parents were not really that much. You know. It was a double edged sword for
the parents but —
Q: Do you remember the names of the groups?

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 1]
October 14, 2010
A: Yeah, Habonim. Oh yes I was a very upright Habonim member. And then when I went to
Switzerland they didn’t have a Habonim and suddenly became Hashamir Hatsaya [ph] as the
next substitute.
Q: But you also had non-Jewish friends that you played with when you were a youngster.
A: Mm hm.
Q: When did you know that conditions were starting to change. I mean you were born in 1923.
Did you, when did you ever hear of a man named Hitler. Do you remember the first —
A: Yes, 1933. I think I heard about him the day I was ten years old.
Q: The day you were ten, ok what did you hear about him? Do you remember what your
impressions were?
A: Terrible things were going to happen.
Q: Who told you, your parents?
A: The neighbors, the parents, it was in the air. There was unrest. It was really turmoil in the air.
Q: And a ten year old child sensed it?
A: You picked that up, yes. It was, you could kind of cut it.
Q: Were there any outward manifestations right then on the street or signs or banners or —
A: Well my, my strongest recollection is the week of Kristallnacht.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 12
October 14, 2010
Q: Yeah, that’s later. We’ll get to that. I’m talking about a little earlier. You’re talking about 33
and you heard that a man named Hitler.
A: Yeah.
Q: Now in control. Did you —
A: Well told us about Hitler and Hindenburg together. You know as a ten year old you didn’t
separate that much.
Q: Is it something you talked over with your family?
A: Mostly in the Habonim group.
Q: Mostly with your friend, ok.
A: Mostly with your contemporaries.
Q: Did you hear any speeches over the radio by Hitler?
A: Yes. And not only that, but not wanting to but without being able to help it, I actually saw
him. I was crossing a major street in Leipzig when his car you know he was Heil-ing Seig Heil-
ing in his open vehicle, driving along —
Q: The motorcade you mean.
A: The motorcade and I was at the curb. And I couldn’t help it. I had to look at him. (laughs)
Q: And you knew exactly who he was.
A: Of course, I mean Seig Heil. I mean everybody knew who he was.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 13
October 14, 2010
Q: I assume you did not do the salute.
A: Of course not.
Q: Did other people on the street —
A: I don’t think people noticed me. Everybody was focused on him.
Q: Him. So they did not notice that you —
A: I mean I was a little, I was small. I was not visible. I’m still only five feet.
Q: And then, again when did conditions start to change. It was 33, 34, 35. Do you remember any
progression, any signs or treatment by neighbors. What non-Jewish neighbors, did they ever say
anything negative or positive to you?
A: Oddly enough, believe it or not we had very good non-Jewish neighbors who were very
friendly. And like the night, just before Kristallnacht, they came and warned us and told us not to
go out the next morning. That the party had sent out word that all members had to show up in
mufti. And start shooting and looting. And it was, Kristallnacht was planned down to the last
detail. And I knew all about it, before it happened. I was told the night before to stay home and
be careful. By non-Jewish neighbors.
Q: What were their names? Do you remember?
A: No.
Q: You don’t.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 14
October 14, 2010
A: But I guess you know Leipzig was a stronghold for communism and I think our neighbors
might have been communists. And that might have been the warning connection. And I didn’t
think of it at the time but in retrospect it would make sense.
Q: Up til Kristallnacht did life go on for you as a child, as a 10, 11, 12, 13 year old normally?
Did it go on, you don’t remember any restrictions cause —
A: No, I mean I went to my private Jewish school.
Q: Ok that was still functioning, all the way til Kristallnacht.
A: Yeah.
Q: It was not closed or anything like that?
A: No, until —
Q: Any restrictions on your father’s business? That you know of.
A: Well I, I think between the economic situation and being Jewish it wasn’t going too well.
Q: It wasn’t going well but it wasn’t taken over or closed down.
A: I mean I don’t think he was closed, it wasn’t shut down or anything. It was just Depression
and —
Q: And your non-Jewish —
A: Actually I think it’s kind of funny, looking back. I don’t know if there was a middle class
Jewish trade or not. But you know Jews were never poor. They just had cash flow problems.
And I don’t think my parents would have ever admitted to not being well off.

Q: Did you have household help?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you have a car?
A: No. My uncle had a Rolls Royce and we used it.
Q: Very impressive. Speaking about your uncle, so you had an extended family that you were —
A: Yeah, my mother had two, had —
Q: That you were close to.
A: I mean she had, she had a younger brother in Leipzig and we were all very close.
Q: Did you get together on holidays?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you have any certain memories of any of the holidays, anything special?
A: Actually this is kind of weird. My worst memory of Passover is we were always invited to
the same family for Passover Seder and I couldn’t stand their silverware.
Q: That’s important.
A: It, no 1t was cheap metal and it had a taste and my parents had a real problem understanding
why I would go with, to Seder and not eat. That was one of the —

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 16
October 14, 2010
Q: Did you celebrate the Sabbath in your own home? Shabbat. Did you light candles? And your
father make a blessing?
A: No my mother lit the candles and we always you know had challah and gefilte fish or regular
fish or matzo ball soup or noodle soup. No we had the traditional.
Q: Traditional holiday. Did you keep kosher?
A: Yes and no. My mother kept kosher for my father. So we had a kosher kitchen. But when we
traveled she and I ate traife and actually with my father’s blessing. He just said he was raised
orthodox. He couldn’t get himself to change. But he was really, he was sort of an accepting
liberal kind of guy. And like if I was sick in bed and needed a treat, he’d come home and bring
me a package of ham, for sandwiches. So you know it was a tradition, not religion.
Q: You said you were a big reader. What were some, who were your favorite authors?
A: All the forbidden. Everybody who was forbidden. Leon Furtwangler, Max Broad. Leon
Trotsky.
Q: This is while you were growing up but it was forbidden for people to read those, yeah.
A: And actually what we did was we passed around the paperbacks. We read them and as we
finished reading we tore off the pages and destroyed them so we wouldn’t get caught.
Q: This is for your youth groups.
A: Mm hm. And I had --- oh the other thing is because in 33 all the German professors were
fired from German universities.
Q: The Jewish professors.

A: Yeah. Since I went to the Kalmbach private high school, every one of my high school
teachers was from what you call it. You know the one outstanding the one well known.
Q: In Leipzig.
A: No in Germany. What was the big university? Heidelberg. Practically every one of my
teachers was from, was a Heidelberg professor. My physics teacher, my chemistry teacher.
Q: Did you know about the book burning?
A: Yeah.
Q: Here you loved books. Do you remember as a young person —
A: I actually remember, I watched them.
Q: In Leipzig?
A: Yeah, I saw them I saw the piles of books on the street in the middle of the road there being
burned.
Q: And —
A: And you passed by and you walked.
Q: And you who loved books, what —
A: What. You know you kept on crying.
Q: Were you frightened by that point seeing what was starting to happen in the country?

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 18
October 14, 2010
A: Tm not sure that, I’m not sure that that’s, I don’t know. I don’t think I was frightened. I
think I was unnerved. No I don’t think I, I don’t think fear was the word. In fact, one of the
peculiar things about the fact that I was a Romanian citizen and my passport did not say that I
was Jewish, I could go out when nobody else, when all Jews were restricted, I could still walk
the streets because my passport didn’t say I was Jewish. I mean obviously policemen were, on
the street people suspected, but they couldn’t prove it. And since nobody could prove that I was
Jewish they couldn’t keep me inside.
So when all the curfews and everything was going I was walking around freely.
Q: I was going to ask you about the curfews and the limitations.
A: I moved.
Q: What did you do? Did you do anything special because you were able to —
A: Well that’s how I, that’s how all my volunteering started. We had this big, ok. The German
no. The Polish government, after the, I forgot his name. now there was a 17 year old Polish kid
who killed the attaché in Paris. And the follow up to that is the German government expelling all
Polish Jews in Germany back into Poland. And they were all brought to the Leipzig railroad
station because you know there was a biggest railroad in Europe and they had all these sidings.
And that’s where I started volunteering. I decided these people all these people showed up in
nightgowns. And I decided they needed toothbrushes. And so I looked up a man who had a
sundry shop. And I knocked on his, went over to his house and knocked on his door. And I told
him that all these Polish Jews sitting on the railroad siding in their nightgowns and that they
needed toothbrushes.
And I made a toothbrush distribution. Of all the crazy — well I guess it was as appropriate as
anything else, wasn’t it. Kind of weird in retrospect.
Q: Did you do this by yourself?
A: Yeah.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 20
October 14, 2010
Q: Did you always carry your passport with you.
A: Yep.
Q: The other Jews in Leipzig at the time had restrictions.
A: I guess.
Q: Like curfew and so forth. Did they have restrictions that where they could go by that time or
were they, or they had freedom to go around the city.
A: It seems to me they were pretty damn restricted. But one of the things I sort of clearly
remember and that was kind of a horrible, horrible I’ve just never forgotten it. Leipzig had some
small rivers and they assembled the elderly bearded Jews on the river’s edge. Now there was the
river. And you know there was paved, I mean there was little river bed and then there was like
pavement and then there were the walls. And what they had done was they rounded up all the
orthodox Jews and made them face the wall and shot into the air. They didn’t kill them. They
just pretended to kill them all. And in some ways that was worse because you heard the shots.
You opened your eyes. You looked and they were still standing. But you know fear, being lined
up against the river bed wall and hearing all these shot gun, I don’t know if they were guns. I
don’t remember what ammo they used but it was pretty —
Q: And you actually saw this?
A: Oh yeah, I stood.
Q: By chance or did they force you all to come out.
A: No, I made a point of going out.

Q: How did you know it was going to happen?
A: I heard the neighbors talk.
Q: The same neighbors that —
A: The communist neighbors.
Q: That warned you about Kristallnacht.
A: I was a very feisty.
Q: Sounds like it. Very unusual for a young girl.
A: No in a peculiar way, I’m not sure I can explain it but I guess I always kind of went along
feeling it’s better to see than not to. I felt more in control being able to watch. I wasn’t so
puzzled. I could see what was going on. But I just sort of hoofed it around.
Q: And then you came home and you told your folks what you saw.
A: Yeah, mm hm.
Q: What were their reactions to all this and what was happening?
A: Horrified. Scared, upset. You know what you expect. And again you had to realize at the
time I wasn’t quite as analytical as. It’s easier to analyze looking back than —
Q: Did the other Jews in Leipzig have to wear a star?
A: That came later.

October 14, 2010
Q: That came later. SO life went on except for these terrible happenings. Before, you went to
school. You did a lot of reading.
A: Well particularly I went to this English translator school.
Q: You learned English.
A: Yeah I had all kinds of good friends.
Q: These were non-Jews.
A: These were non-Jews, but these were immersion classes and —
Q: they treated you well. Did you ever experience any anti-Semitism on the street or at the —
A: I’m sure I did but I don’t think it registered. Or if it registered, it didn’t stick. I mean I’m sure
I was called names by other kids. I just can’t remember the specifics.
Q: Do you ever remember being frightened at any time.
A: Not really.
Q: Did you know what was happening in the rest of the world? Did you know about the
Anschluss when that happened, when Hitler went into Czechoslovakia?
A: Oh yes. As a matter of fact I was politically very astute. Because of my membership in the

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 23
October 14, 2010
A: Not eventually. As soon as possible.
Q: And how did they prepare you for that?
A: Well looking back it’s all kind of weird, because at the time they told you to go up and go in
some farm and learn agriculture to get hachshava. And you know looking back good lord I
mean who came up with this you know what I’m saying. But at the time it was a solution to a
problem.
Q: How to be a good farmer.
A: Yep.
Q: What did you do? Milk cows?
A: No. I dug potatoes. I harvested potatoes and one of the other strange things in all of this mish
mash there was, there were some really large Swiss corporations and they owned acres on which
they grew stuff. And when I went to Switzerland we volunteered to dig up potatoes for the, for
the Swiss chemical companies. These companies, these chemical companies owned farmland.
And they actually cultivated them and so we volunteered and we dug up their potatoes for them.
In exchange for which we got to live in a Swiss castle.
Q: This was like a summer project, when you went to Switzerland?
A: I guess so.
Q: This is while you’re still living in Leipzig that you went to Switzerland.
A: No I just left, I mean | left Leipzig for good.

A: Yeah.
Q: What?
A: The Kalmbach synagogue got set on fire.
Q: And you actually saw that.
A: Oh yes.
Q: And what were the firemen doing? Anything?
A: No. The, the other interesting thing and oddly enough was sort of years later, had a follow up
right here in Washington, DC. The librarian from the Folger Theater. His aunt and uncle owned
one of the biggest haberdasher firms in Leipzig. And they, they were foreign subjects and so
when they set things on fire in Leipzig in the Jewish stores, when they looted and had everything
on fire. They protected the foreign owned. They actually had the fire department with their hoses
sprinkle down and save the foreign Jewish businesses. And Leipzig had one what they called a
high rise. I mean the Hoch House. It was ten stories and it was English owned. The fire
department protected that. It could not be touched because it was foreign property.
Q: A British Jewish?
A: Mm hm but see it became British rather than Jewish.

Q: I know you were strong. I know you were independent, but what were your reactions seeing
your synagogue being burned?
A: Shock, disillusion, sad.
Q: Any fear?
A: I don’t think I was afraid. I think what saved me was not being afraid. I think that’s what
helped me get through it. I was just sort of leading with my chin up front. Maybe I’m too stupid
to be afraid.
Q: Did you see any other synagogues being burned or just the Kalmbach?
A: No, I saw them. They set fire to the Forum temple. It was only about two blocks.
Q: And were there crowds on the street watching?
A: I assume. I mean yes there were people, just how closely they watched or whether they were
delighted or whether they were appalled, it’s been, you know some of these details you don’t —

able to meet with your youth group?
A: Yeah.
Q: They permitted that?
A: Yeah.
Q: It was permitted.
A: In fact anything that helped get Jews out of Germany was initially permitted. Because
initially Hitler wasn’t going to kill all the Jews. He was just going to get rid of them.
Q: What did you spend your time doing now that you couldn’t go to school?
A: Reading. Did a ferocious amount of reading. Oh and visiting with friends, including non-

Q: So you all left very quickly after Kristallnacht. Ok. Got to Switzerland.
A: And —
Q: How did your parents decide to go to Switzerland? Cause it was neutral?
A: Yeah. Except I mean my father was totally unrealistic. Hitler’s going to last six months and
the Germans will know what a bargain. God Almighty. I mean never mind. When I remember, I
still get angry. Because there was no excuse for being that much of an ostrich. But anyway, I
was in Switzerland, and I sort of worked as an au pair and studied English and made the best of
things. And oh there were funny little things. I mean it was such a peculiar time. Like my parents
couldn’t send me money. You didn’t get permission to send money out of Germany anymore.
So they would send me pounds and pounds of nail polish which I could sell and that gave me
spending money. Cause you know, I was kind of a 16 year old hustler, putting it in modern lingo.
But it gave me spending money.
Q: Was it hard for you to say goodbye to your parents?
A: Well I was a runaway.
Q: They wanted you to go back to Germany with them?
A: Yeah. I was on a train with my mother going back to Germany. And when the conductor
said all aboard I jumped off. And the train didn’t stop until after it crossed the border and there
was nothing she could do.
Q: Why did you want to do that?
A: I wasn’t about to go back to Germany. No, no ten horses could get me back there.
Q: So this was a surprise to her too?

little break.
Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum

being in Switzerland. And then you eventually obviously left Switzerland. How did that come
about and where did you go? Did someone in the United States sponsor you? Can you tell me a
little bit about that.
Ruth Rappaport: Ok my mother’s oldest brother sponsored me to come to the States. And he had
already sponsored two other brothers. So my mother had three brothers in Seattle, Washington.
And that’s where I went.
Q: And who was this person who sponsored you, his business and so forth?
A: He was the salmon king. He started the king salmon industry of the United States.

Q: Had he sponsored anybody else before you?
A: Well, actually it was kind of cute. There were three brothers. My mother had three brothers.
And there were three gay bachelors in South America. And they had themselves a really good
time in Argentina. Having fun and dating and traveling and doing all sorts of things. And then
two of them came to the United States. They worked their way up from Argentina to British
Columbia. They settled in Westminster of all places. Little dumpy, not known for anything
place. And they got established there. And by the time I got to Seattle, I had three uncles to live
with.
Q: You had said previously that he was quite wealthy.
A: No, as I said he, during the Depression, his certified income was $350,000, he cleared, he
paid income tax on $350,000 income. So that is, that was a good bit of change in 1935. And as I
say, I would never mention it expect that it’s part of the affidavit so it is a matter of record. It’s

Germany?
A: Well what everybody else knew. I mean you know the usual. Wasn’t anything different.
Q: Why didn’t they come to the United States at that time? Because of the quota system.
A: Because of the quota system.
Q: But you were able to get out under the quota system.

born.

Q: Where did you leave from?

A: Mm.
Q: You were handling it yourself?
A: As a matter of fact. It had never occurred to me that my uncle from Seattle, Washington
would come to New York to look for me. And so when the ship arrived in New York, I was
sitting up on deck, dumb, fat and happy, watching all the families reunite. Oh I had a great time
because you know husbands and wives are meeting up and parents and children were meeting
up. And it was such a lively good scene. People had gotten out of Europe. And they had made it
to the United States and everything was sort of happy, happy, happy. And I was sitting up on
deck watching it all.
Because I didn’t except anybody to look for me. And all of a sudden, in those days we still had
these little Western Union boys. With the funny little straps. And here’s this little flag coming
along. Paging Ruth Rappaport, paging Ruth Rappaport. And finally I realized that was my name
up there.
And so I said that’s me and so the little Western Union boy, he was dragging this five by five
gentleman who turned out to be my uncle. And so my uncle is standing there and saying what in
hell is taking you so long.
Q: Had you met him before?
A: Unh.
Q: It was the first time you met him?
A: Had no, the only thing that was funny is that also my father had a brother in New York. So I
had an uncle on each side of the family. And while they were looking for me, the two uncles met.
And it was sort of sad because the New York uncle wanted me to stay in New York before going
out west. And I was so tempted. You know I heard about Broadway. I had heard about New

been sitting there for six weeks. Waiting for me.
And the only, and they had to leave that day because uncle was involved in a court case in
Seattle. And so when it was a question of immediately going to Seattle, or seeing New York, I

That was in the day of the Pullman. We had two drawing rooms. Pardon me. I had my own
bedroom.

kid. I don’t know if it wasn’t kosher. In that little village. Or I don’t know why he never had ice
cream. But you know he gave you a hundred dollars as a present, That was nothing. But he

we had made arrangements and we had paid $10,000 for them to try and get Cuban visas, which
was legal you know you could. You could do it legally. And if it hadn’t been for December
seventh, my parents would have been in Cuba. And it was that damned December seventh that
killed it all. And in fact it was interesting because we paid $10,000 to make these arrangements
and they, they offered the money back saying they could do nothing.
Q: The lawyers that offered the money back?
A: Yeah and so we just, the Dickstein company. And so we just decided if there, they don’t want
to take the money, there’s no point in pushing. If they say the money doesn’t help any, what’s
the point of. You might as well, you know if lawyers give you back the money because they
can’t help you, there’s no point pushing money on them.

fact I’m really proud of my time there. Because one of the things I did that nobody else had

A: Yeah but I had a Romanian passport and I had an uncle who knew judges. But some of my
German, German Jewish college friends all had to be home at 8:00 at night. I mean it was sort of
bizarre because here we’re German Jewish refugees.
Q: Considered just German.
A: Being treated as German subjects and punished. I mean sometimes looking back at our own
legal manipulations you wonder, what, what in the hell were we doing. No really, it was all the
good about the United States. You know we had some awfully strange —

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 44
October 14, 2010
A: University of California.
Q: So then you traveled all over the far east you said.
A: Yeah.
Q: Had you been back to Germany at that time?
A: I didn’t go back to Germany for years and years and years. And I never wanted to go back to
Germany. And actually I had an American friend who was a school counselor for the American
dependent school system in Germany. She was living in Frankfurt. And she insisted I come and
visit. And so finally one day I decided I would visit her because I discovered Frankfurt was a
good place to visit. There’s nothing to do in Frankfurt except have coffee at a coffee house once
and that takes care of Frankfurt.
But from Frankfurt there are a million, it’s a major railroad center. And I went down to the,
every morning I went down to the railroad station and I checked where the next train was going
to. And if it got to an interesting city or place in one and a half hours, I’d get on it. And spend
the day at like Rothenburg or Baden-Wirttemberg or up, up and down the Rhine river. On
river boats. And so I’d spend the day sight-seeing. And depending how my friend Ellis felt, 1f she
was in the mood, we’d meet up and go out for dinner together. Or else I'd go home and have
dinner with her at home. And so —
Q: What was it like to come back to Germany?
A: I went back with a horrendous amount of reluctance. I didn’t think I was ever going to go
back. And don’t forget all the years Leipzig was East Germany, so I couldn’t have gone to
Leipzig anyway. I went back under really duress, by a friend.
However, it was Easter vacation and we took her automobile and we put 2000 miles on the car
during the Danube trip and then the Vienna Woods trip. We went to Budapest, via Vienna and

came back through the Durnow, through the Danube riverbed. And we put 2000 miles on the car
in nine days, never went to sleep. But what a trip.
Q: Was this in the 1990s.
A: 80s.
Q: In the 1980s.
A: And oh I don’t know. Years are kind of merging a little. But —
Q: You retired from the Department of Defense. And traveling all over the far east and then lived
in Washington from then on.
A: Mm hm.
Q: And did you work for any other group after the Defense Department? No.
A: I can’t believe it. I’ve been retired 19 years and it seems like a year. In fact I think this is
more interesting and I had retired. I think what’s really interesting is that all my coworkers are
still showing up here, picking my brains. At least twice a month, they come and have lunch here
and they pick my brains about. To begin with they still had lots of employees I know. And so
when they have a, and they have supervisory problems, please you know this kid. What do you
think I ought to do with Aaron. He’s just obstreperous.
Q: Are you involved in any volunteer work? Are you, in the community? I hear that you are,
that’s why I’m asking.
A: A little bit.
Q: Through the past years you were active on Capitol Hill.

A: I’m active, oh Capitol Hill village. Are you familiar with that or not? That I think you might
kind of check out. And if you don’t know it, I think you should meet Gail Cohn. She is the
executive director. And she is quite a personality.
Q: So you’re doing community, you’re active in the community. Can we talk now about your
thoughts and your ideas about what you went through. Do you feel very German?
A: Hell no. I never felt German. I was Romanian.
Q: OK, do you feel Romanian?
A: No. I mean you know I’m sort of in between and betwixt. I had a passport from a country I
barely knew. I lived in a country where I didn’t have a passport. I mean I was just kind of
floating.
Q: Do you think in English or —
A: Oh yes. Now if I want to say, if I switch to German, I have to really push a button. I really
have to make a switch and force my -- I mean I can think in German but it’s a conscious effort.
Q: What are your feelings about Germany? Today?
A: (pause) Ill tell you one little story which I think was interesting. When I went traveling with
my friend Ellis, since she doesn’t speak a word of German, and I do. I was always in charge of
the arrangements. And the Germans are very polite. And when we said and I, you know I would
order the meal in German. And invariably they wouldn’t say who are you or where are you from
or what is your background. What I was getting was, oh you as, for an American you are
speaking in excellent German. Now this is a whole bunch of bullshit because I do not speak
excellent German. I speak a teenage German. I speak a slang German. Well not really, semi

slang. And it was the German way of trying to find out who, what I am, without being too
inquisitive was this line of your German for an American is so good. Da, da, da, da, da.
And as I say it’s just a slangy colloquial every day teenage German that I speak but that was their
way of trying to place me. And what was interesting, among all those travels we did, there was
one hotel that was closed that we needed a place to stay. And the hotel people gave us a key to
the whole hotel and let us stay 1n it.
I mean it was really sort of phenomenal the kind of nice experiences we had when we went
traveling. And it all seemed to have something to do with, as I said, people recognizing that they
were too polite to do too much fishing but they knew there was a story. And so without being too
obviously curious they accepted the story.
Q: Did you ever go back to Leipzig?
A: No.
Q: Do you want to go?
A: Not really. It’s also, I mean I’ve outgrown Leipzig.
Q: I know this is painful, but can you tell me how, I know you said you found out through the
Red Cross about what happened to your parents. How did you go about that? You contacted
them.
A: Yeah and they eventually tracked.
Q: And let you know in writing what happened.
A: Yeah.
Q: Do you remember approximately when that was. In the late 40s

A: (whispering) Oh I don’t remember.
Q: You don’t remember. What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial?
A: (pause) I think I had a sense of relief when the thing was finally over. It just got to be tedious.
It went on and on and on and on.
Q: Did you watch any of it?
A: Some of it, I guess.
Q: Any special meaning to it for you or not?
A: It was just another part of the whole big mess. I mean I think that whole Nazi period is just
sort of it’s one big mess in my mind. And I really, I guess I don’t think I’ve ever really thought I
wanted to sit down and isolate different components.
Q: Have you been to the Holocaust Museum here in Washington?
A: Oh yeah.
Q: What kind of feeling do you have when you walk in there? Do you have an emotional
connection or —
A: Ok. Personally, I like visiting the Yad Vashem. That’s where I belong.
Q: Because —
A: I can identify with the lay out. I can identify with the righteous Christians. I can, I have all
kinds of linkage to it. I think the Holocaust Museum 1s a truly great educational institution. But
it’s not my connection to the Holocaust.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 49
October 14, 2010
Q: Is it because Yad Vashem is in Israel?
A: In part. And because of the way it’s laid out. And, and I don’t think, I haven’t told you. I had
a very sort of interesting experience when I was in Switzerland. In order to get out of Germany
I, in order to get out of Europe, to the States. I couldn’t go through Italy because whatever, no
transportation and this and that. And so the only way to go was by way of Holland. But in order
to get to Holland I had to go back through Germany because whoever was controlling visas
hadn’t made a peace treaty yet and I couldn’t get — the only way I could get out of Europe was
by backtracking.
And (pause) wait a minute. This was going to go somewhere.
Q: You’re talking about trying to get out
A: And I kind of had a kind of a bit of a back and forth shuttle between Holland and it took some
doing. I finally got out by leaving Europe in a strange little border town called Sansival [ph] or
Sumerwal [ph] or it was a strange sounding name. And the only thing on that trip leaving
Europe 1s I did get to see the Monica [ph] on peace in Brussels on the way out. That was one
compensation for the weird travel I had to do. But it was a bad time to come to the States
because the war was on.
Q: But we hadn’t gone to war yet. The United States hadn’t gone to war yet.
A: No but Europe was —
Q: Europe was at war, right. To get out.
A: And there was fighting in the channel. And travel was not easy. And I had to get out.
Q: And you were all of 16. Just amazing. All five feet of you.

A: Mm hm.
Q: Did you ever think this is just too hard for me?
A: Hell no, no. I-
Q: You were assertive as you said in the beginning.
A: Yeah and not only that. Challenges were to be met. It’s just that simple. Goody, one more
step to take.
Q: You are that way because of the way you were raised? Or just because of who you are? Did
your parents raise you to be that way.
A: No, I was a very timid child. I was very shy. I was very quiet. I was smart.
Q: So what precipitated the change?
A: The events and things that happened. Having to meet what came along. No, I mean my
whole behavior is strictly existential. Meet what comes.
Q: Are you more religious because of what you went through, less religious.
A: ’'m not at all religious. I had really strong Jewish identity. I am not religious. What little, I
mean I go to services off and on because it’s the thing to do, but not because I’m praying.
Q: Is it more for the sense of community?
A: Yeah, exactly. I mean I, you know I’m very much a part of the Capital Hill Havurah. That’s
my interest and that’s my sphere of influence. And that’s where I participate. And that’s where I
put my mouth. And that’s where I put my money.

Interview with Ruth Rappaport 51
October 14, 2010
Q: Did you, speaking about where you put your mouth and your money, during the civil rights
era here in the United States because you obviously knew very well what happened in Europe
when civil rights were being taken away, were you active here. Or were you living abroad at the
time? In the 60s and 70s?
A: About the only, the only part of that I feel I can kind of answer readily is I just lost my oldest
dearest black friend. She just died. She had a mysterious infection and they still don’t know what
she died of. But the first thing that happened when I came to Seattle, Washington, I heard about
fair housing. And I don’t think I’d been in Seattle more than a month and I trooped off to the
state capital demonstrating for fair housing. And so that was my, that was the beginning of my
endeavors. And my friend, Felicia who is my oldest closest black friend, her son refers to me as
his home mama and he still comes and visits. And she has two sons. And they’re both my
friends. And they consider me their, ersatz mama. Both of them eminently successful. In their
own endeavors. One is a computer security big shot.
Q: What are your thoughts about Israel? Have you been there many times?
A: OK I spent oh dear god. I spent the siege of Jerusalem in Jerusalem. I fought the battle of Ben
Yehuda street.
Q: So you were living there at the time?
A: Yep.
Q: What was your role there?
A: I manned the Spandau machine gun. I did. On my roof. I fed —
Q: Were you there when the UN voted the partition in 47.

A: No, I was in San Francisco. I was dancing the hora outside the opera house.
Q: And the partition plan. And then you went over to, when did you go to —
A: On the first of January 1948.
Q: You decided to go to Palestine.
A: Mm hm. I was an advance party of one.
Q: Working for.
A: The Zionist Emergency Council.
Q: Oh I see. You talked about that. You went over to do that. To open an office or —
A: No to prepare the way for VIP. Oh we were very clever. They were going to have all the rich
San Francisco Jews go on a mission. Now they call them missions. We were going to have all
the people who gave money and time to work towards partition. We were going to have this
publicity flight, DP, destination Palestine. Oh weren’t we clever. And so I was going to be the
advance party of one. And I was dispatched. And when I got there I sent a telegram saying war
broke out. Stay home. And at that time I was still connected to the Seattle publication. And the
San Francisco Emanuel Bulletin put me on their contributor list. So they took stories from me.
Q: You wrote stories from —
A: Israel.
Q: From Israel. And so you were there during the war of independence.
A: Yeah.

Q: You were there when the state, when Ben Gurion declared the state.
A: Yep. As a matter of fact I have a very nice letter, I just can’t find it. The government of Israel
finally sent me this piece of parchment thanking me for my assistance in establishing the state of
Israel. But I can’t find it. Don’t know what in the hell I did with it.
Q: Tell me about your experience during the war of independence
A: The what?
Q: Tell me your experience during the war. You said you were on a rooftop
A: Yeah. I was living in the tallest house on Ben Yehuda street in Jerusalem. And we had a
Spandau machine gun on the top. And we trained it to the YMCA and we exchanged fire.
Q: And you actually fired it?
A: Of course.
Q: How did you know how to do it?
A: Well somebody showed me. And you know people sort of sometimes say ok I seem to be war
prone. And you know I frequently get this business of aren’t you scared. And you know I’m not
scared. You know why. I pretend I’m a spectator. I’m not in this war. I’m watching this war.
And that’s it, gets me off the hook. I don’t have to worry.

and pointing guns at the Americans or the Israelis. That’s another whole chapter the British exit
of unh. You know 20" century history has been pretty ugly.
Q: How long did you stay in Israel?
A: Until July 1950.
Q: Working as a correspondent.
A: I was in the foreign press office. And I helped establish the Israel photographic archives.
Never mind. I get side tracked into things.
Q: These were government sponsored offices.
A: Yeah. Dishcat Internat Hutz [ph] foreign press service
Q: So you were fluent in Hebrew obviously.
A: No. Foreign press service worked in English.
Q: By living there did you become fluent?
A: Well the Israel government sent a professor to my office every morning and I had one hour
Hebrew instruction but this didn’t take too well. This nice little rotund man showed up one
morning. And I said what can I do for you and he said no you’re not doing for me. I’m doing for
you. I’m your Hebrew teacher. Although had somebody put me on the right track, I could have
learned a hell of a lot more Hebrew, a hell of a lot faster than what I did. Because once you play
around with the three root characters it becomes a very simple, simply structured language. And
I almost feel like I could go in front of the computer and spend two months and learn Hebrew
now.

Q: Did you meet any of the government leaders in Israel?
A: Well I went to parties with Moshe Sharet and in fact —
Q: Did you meet Golda Meir?
A: Oh Golda and I are old friends. In fact this was very funny because when I went to — oh. I
took Golda to the top of the Mark Hopkins for a drink once.
Q: This is much later obviously.
A: No this is earlier. Golda was in the states on some fundraising. And I invited her for a drink
to the Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco because of the view. And I guess she was forever
grateful that somebody did such a nice thing for her. And at the time, we had a drink at the Mark
Hopkins in San Francisco, Golda gave me a dirty look and she said, the trouble is people like you
don’t’ come to Israel. You’re the kind of person we need. To get things going. To get things
done, to get things accomplished. But no you raise money to send other people. And them was
fighting words. And I said don’t bet on it. Next thing I’m sitting in Golda’s office and said, in
Tel Aviv and I’m saying I would like to join the army. And she said what’s the matter with you?
Why the army. And I said because when working in the kitchen Ill learn Hebrew and she said
no, if you’re working in the kitchen you’|l be learning how to peel potatoes. She was a very
practical lady you know. She had her feet firmly on the ground. And so I said well if it’s not the
kitchen.
Q: What else can I do?
A: What else can I do? And so she put me down at the foreign press office. She said with your
command of English and your knowledge of newspaper work and publicity, and that’s when I
got busy and I did we did pack, information packets each month. To Anglo language consulates.
And I did the selection of all the pictures and the story line. I wrote the features. But I think

looking back, I didn’t initiate all that much. I just never let an opportunity slip. I mean I was kind
of Johnny on the spot. And I guess it was always sort of you know well what if goes wrong. so
what. And I just didn’t worry about results too much.
But one of my, I guess one of the things that was sort of pleasing to me is among placing
photographs for publication we had a Canadian tank commander who was a Machal volunteer
and I got his picture into Life magazine. And I thought that was an accomplishment. And I think
that my biggest contribution to this whole English publicity bit was that I took a very firm stand
and I said the pick and shovel days are over. Israel needs big time money to get off the ground.
You don’t get big time money and support of paving a road with a pick and ax. And so I said get
away from this dumb publicity of the pioneer who does everything and get this, the people who
are starting a state.
And so all my publicity was geared to income producing like I did a wonderful series on Tapu
Hai Za’havy [ph], the Golden Apples. I mean oranges. But orange export could to for the
economy.
Q: The Jaffa oranges?
A: Yeah and so I got into that kind of thing for the English press and that was kind of fun. And
also what it meant was that I attended the first of everything. The first Yama, the first holiday of
this, the first military parade, the first airplane show. I got to go to all of those. And that was
kind of rewarding. It lasted for one year everything was a first and that was kind of great fun.
Q: Did you have any contact with Holocaust survivors in Israel at the time?
A: Not specifically. In fact ’'m not sure I wasn’t avoiding it but I wasn’t trailing the Holocaust. I
was future oriented, not backwards. What happened, happened.
Q: Do you think it could happen again?
A: (pause) Yes. Unfortunately, yes. Again it’s less apt to happen now. We have more
competition. The other groups who also have problems. The competing minorities. But anti-

news for you. It can happen anywhere any time. You hope and pray it won’t. But I would not bet
that there won’t be another —
Q: Is there anything you would like to add, anything you’d like to say that you haven’t said.
A: I don’t know.
Q: Extraordinary life you’ve had.
A: I think I’m done.
Q: I love what you said when you said your volunteering tendencies came from giving out
toothbrushes. To the Jews in the train car. So you’ve continued volunteering. Do you think a lot
about those days now. You don’t
A: No. I told you. I’m forward oriented. I mean what’s the point. Most of what’s happened is
recorded by now. We have a lasting, we have lasting documentary evidence. And just, no I look
forward, not backwards.
Q: Thank you for looking a little bit backwards. For history.
A:You know what I’m saying. And I still think it’s kind of funny that all of this started with the
Poles being shipped out of Germany.

Q: Mauthausen?
A: Yeah. But there’s just been too much in pictures and pictorials. I mean no. I really try not to
relive the past. I think one of the things that’s kind of ironic. I’m sort of waiting to see how all of
this is going to play is I think the one thing that our president is doing right 1s the one thing he’s
hurt by. Because as he says, he’s not a black president, he’s a president who is black. And I
think the blacks have it in for him because he won’t be a black president. And I think that’s too
unfortunate. And I’m sort of afraid that he may be a one term — kind of too sad because it’s his
own folks who turn against him. I think the white population is much more charitable in terms of
accepting him. I think the blacks are disappointed because he isn’t playing to the blacks. It’s
unfortunate because I say that’s the one thing he is doing. We’Il see what happens but I’m
looking a little, the political scene looks a little dismal right now.
Q: You've lived through very dismal times in your youth.
