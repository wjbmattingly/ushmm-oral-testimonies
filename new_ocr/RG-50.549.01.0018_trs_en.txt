Interview with Felix Horn
[Date not labeled on audio tapes]

Question: Why don't we start by saying, just say you're name and where we are
right now.

Answer: Well my name is Felix Horn. | was born in Poland, in Lublin. And lama
survivor. | was liberated in 1945 and after liberation | went searching for anyone
who might be still alive from my family so | returned to my hometown, Lublin. Which
is in the middle of Poland. It is one of the rather bigger, larger cities. There were
140,000 people prior to the war. Out of this at least half of it, 70,000 people
comprised of Jewish population. My family, a rather assimilated family and they all
perished, all prior to 1945 when Lublin ghetto was destroyed and all went to, as far
as | know, to the concentration camp, My-don-ick (ph). | came back to Lublin in
1945 and there was already some Jewish life present in Lublin, mainly from people
who had returned from Russia, who escaped the war, escaped the Nazis and went
to Soviet Russia and survived the war over there. | met some of my acquaintances,
some friends even from my school days, but not from my school per se since | was
only Jewish student in a Catholic school. And as anybody else you register and you
left notes on the walls and then anybody who talked to you, look | am here, if you
hear anything from this and that please let me know, and to my surprise, | found two
Uncles, they survived the war. One survived being hidden by a Polish family. He
used to be an officer in Polish Air Force prior to the war, which was very, very
uncommon. And he was looking for the property that belonged to my grandparents

actually, thinking everybody perished so he can probably take over the property.
One of my favorite Uncles. Another Uncle, his younger brother, survived in
Yugoslavia. He escaped the Nazis in Eastern Poland and he was a musician. He
organized a military band for Marshal Teito (ph) of Yugoslavia. And that's how he
got into the partisan group and so on and he spent all the time until 1945 when |
found him in my home town too. Everybody came home looking for survivors. And
he attempted to take me with him to Yugoslavia since we found that nobody else
survived the war, which my parents and my sister, all my Uncles, cousins,
numerous people. And he couldn't get me legally to Yugoslavia since | was not so-
called blood relative. I'm only a nephew. If | be his brother or his child it would be
different. So | couldn't go with him so | was left in Poland again. My Uncle was not
particularly close to me after the war anyway. And we didn't find too many things in
common. However, | didn't know what to do with myself. | remember | promised
my Mom that if | survived | would make all attempt | can to resume my education. |
did have two years of medical school, until 1941. Between 1939 and 1941. And
then | had to interrupt for obvious reasons, and then the decision had to be made.
Should | go make a living somehow, | was hungry? | had a wife. We were married
in Warsaw ghetto. And, or go to school. We couldn't afford, both of us were young,
to go to school. How's going to support us? So | didn't Know what to do. |

in a kind of a confused frame of mind but my first Uncle
came to rescue. He gave me some gold coins to sell in the black market and buy
food, and do whatever | wanted to.
Q: Who did this?
A: My Uncle who survived in Poland. He was the officer of Polish Air Force. | used
the coins for about two years to survive. | didn't do nothing. It was, situation very
chaotic in Poland. The Communists took over. The only chance was to go to
school. So | thought, well, there's time to do it. | registered, | had saved all my
documents, they were buried. All my documents except my High School Degree,
which somehow was lost. But | did have my University Degrees, my University
books, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my
former University in Luneburg called Woolf (ph), they moved to Western Poland at
that time, and | decided to move to Breslau, , former German
territory, where the same professor of my former school, Woolf (ph), resided now in
the same town. So | registered with no problem whatsoever. The papers were
okay. The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall
exactly where he came from, but the remarks | heard in the class. It was, another
two Jews. Hitler didn't kill all of you? You know, and the class was so annoying, not
annoying but frightening even. And the common trend was at that time the refugees

coming back from Russia to Poland, not finding no purpose living in Poland, they all

were going West.

Q: Let me ask you about that a little bit, just the atmosphere in Poland at that time.

The Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly

environment for Jews.

A: Right.

Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like? What that felt like’?

A: Well, just to mention here that | was raised in a rather very modern Jewish home,

although my home was kosher. Just because kosher was believed to be healthier

and free of any contamination and so on. But my father was very progressive man.

First he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so

on. He was a modern person. And we were living away from the Jewish center

mostly so | had a formal Jewish education. | had a teacher come to my home

teaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so

on. | never spoke Yiddish though. My parents spoke Yiddish to each other. |

brought from school, | was going to a Catholic school, Yiddish was foreign to me.

But | did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in

Polish. | was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable. Poles have difficult

time to look at me, | have Semitic look though. And then my Polish is so different

than the Jews in Poland. You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super. In
other words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type. Blonde, blue eyes, etc. |
have a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the
difference. Jews were walking more as bent , kind of scared
a little bit. Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right. Someone might be
hitting them or attack them or something. It didn't have to be a problem. You could
be hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans. Boys. Seven, nine, ten
years old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever.
So, you know, | was different. | was straight. My Polish was impeccable as they
say but they knew who | was because | did return to my original name, which is not
classical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either. Horn is really rather German or
Dutch. Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names. So there was a little
confusion, wanted to know who | am. No one dared to ask
me exactly, are you a Jew or not? But then shortly in classes | didn't hide it. | didn't
have no reason to hide it anymore. | was hiding all those years. So then they come
and seek it, who | am. So there was people, | still have quite a few friends, Polish
friends. But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away
from me. They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very
cordial. So | felt very uncomfortable. And then during the pilgrim in Kielce in Poland

| got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure. And
being young, saying what am | going to do in Poland? | couldn't live in a country
that | didn't have a grave to go to. We had nobody left. My Uncle went back to
Yugoslavia. The other one converted to Christianity, the first one. They had
nothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because | was
Jewish. Not that he hated the Jews. No. Why did he do it? | don't know. We
never talked about it. He was not a person | could have a dialogue with anyway.
When | left | didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested. So talking to a
few other students of other departments in University, the University

school, philosophical department, so on and so on. We
talked about it and | inquire how they feel about it? What would they do? Would
they stay here? What are their plans actually? They were all in the same boat.
Q: These were other Jewish students?
A: Pardon me?
Q: These were other Jewish students or?
A: Who?
Q: That you were speaking with about this.
A: Some of them. But most of them not. But they admitted who they are. They
were Jewish and so on. And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave. It would

have to be illegal. There was no legal way for them to have left. You didn't have no
visa. You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers. Besides those papers
would take ages before you get legal entry, you know. Even after you get you're
visa you might take five, ten years. Some of my friends had to go to Sweden
because it was much faster to get out of Sweden to the United States they say than
wait in Poland for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if
you're a Jew. And so | organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph)
of students. And | think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if | recall
correctly, what | was told. | was not good at Hebrew either. | read Hebrew, | read
my Prayer Book and so on but | don't understand them. | read automatically. |
know the text, what it means, but not word by word. But my wife speaks Hebrew.
And we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha
(ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young,
Jewish people. The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of
information of Israeli Armed Forces. Those are the young people who are politically
involved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of
whatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to Palestine at that time.
There was no Israel yet. And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the
hostile Poland where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. Asa

matter of fact all my furniture was given to some neighbors and so on. They refused
to give me anything, you know? They belonged to us. The fur coats and radios,
instead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. They did not have to relinquish
their status. And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get
something back, at least something. Talking about silverware, the candelabra that
were a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. All those things perished of course.
They, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it,
they had to sell it, some of them. They couldn't survive. Anyway, it was immaterial
anymore to me, | lost more than that. And with this we made a contact with the bra-
ha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by train we are going to a little town
near the border. From there we were met by a group of people, we never really
introduced before. They knew about us though. And with their help and their
contacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way. We went
right across the border to Czechoslovakia. Don't forget, this was, at that time it was
1946. Still people coming and going to Poland, looking for family. From Poland to
Vienna, Austria, Czechoslovakia. Looking for some. survivors, different
concentration camp. So the guards at the border were not very religious in stopping
people. Even if they seen somebody. There was no invasion or so, there was a
peaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. But anyway, as a

group maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from
Czechoslovakia. They put us on trucks to Vienna. And then over there we were
met by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. And they were very
instrumental. Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. First they had
contact with the local authorities, also notorious. Don't forget they had a lot of
influence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. So
they were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. So for that reason alone
probably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. First we got a
school to our disposal. We have no home so they give us a whole school, big room,
and there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and
some boys. So we had to divide the one huge room, it was like a theater of some
kind or an auditorium, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like
small cubicles. We had the beds over there like military beds. And it was very
comfortable really. And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student
books and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything
for us into German. And they, having some contacts at the University, we didn't
have to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents
were in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in
medicine, some were first time that they started the University. | was already a third

year medical school student, fourth year. | had one year after the war in Poland so
this would be my fourth year. But medicine in Vienna was seven years so | still had
four, five, six, four more years to go. In German, that | never handled. | spoke
French. | speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. But |
learn it fast. And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and
exams | passed. Maybe because we were survivors. I'm sure there was some
bearing to it, you know? They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as
smooth as a transition until they knew, around this new medical school, as they
could. Which | was very grateful for. We had no tuition. American Joint provided
this. And then we received food, they provide food for us too. So we were like a
little Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not
hungry. And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings,
new people. We met some friends who were there before us from Poland. Some
of them Viennese Jewish students, one. We were very close. I'm sure we're much
closer now than if this would have happened before the war. Because we have
something in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody. There was not one
person who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family.

Q: Let me just ask you did people in that situation you're in, with people with that
background, did you all talk about, did you compare experiences much? Talk about
what had happened?
A: Yes. | think our experiences were different. Everybody had a different story to
tell. And, someone came from Russia, some had survived in the labor camps in
Romania, some students survived in ghettos in Hungary and they were beaten and
so they were persecuted, but they survived. And someone survived in their families
even, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know? But always
someone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know? But we had
common ground because we belonged to the same group of people. We were
Jews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you
know? And everybody had their own stories. We sit at night and talk and talk and
talk. And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be
fascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was,
how did you survive? Until today | ask myself the same question, how did | survive?
| don't know. There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do. If
you turn left it was you're death but | didn't know that. You turn right, you survive. If
you walked out during the day no one stopped you. At night, they shoot you. So it's
hard to say. Is that fate? | never believe in fate, but | don't know. Some of my

Indian colleagues, physicians, right now who is very, , he
believe fate is something of, some external thing. He tried to convince me, this was
inscribed in the Book upstairs, that | would survive. Well, | can't prove it, let's prove
that. But | had many, many days and nights of doubt if | will. The only sad story
was, if | perish this second, this minute, why didn't | perish earlier? Why should |
have to suffer all the time, you know? But we had one goal, to go ahead and study
was the number one. Most of us promised our parents, we want the memory of our
parents not let down. | personally promised my Mom before they took her away to
concentration camp that if | escaped from the ghetto, my town Lublin, she had
asked me that | had to promise to her, if | ever survive. She apologized, she cannot
help me anymore, that | will never forget to go back to school. To make a better
person of myself. And | promise her. My Mom was an opera singer. She was very
disappointed when | decide to go to medicine. My Dad, after he became an
architect, he was upset | won't be an architect. | play violin so | try to compromise. |
drew, I've been drawing beautiful pictures of buildings, talent from my father, that |
got accustomed to seeing everyday. And to them, the best writer, clearly, printing
and so on, you know, | draw things beautiful, | paint. So | do lots of things, so in
memory of my Mom that | still play music. Maybe this gives a little peace, that |
didn't let her down completely. But | felt since | was 13, that's all | want to do. |

remember sick little boy. He was at that time maybe seven or eight, | don't

remember his age exactly. | was maybe 13 or so, and he was getting shots and he

was so sick. There was a clinic, we couldn't afford a private doctor, we go to poor

people's clinic. And | felt if | could help that kid, if | could do something for him but |

didn't know what | could do. But that give me the idea that | would like to go to

medicine. Didn't know what I'm going to do in medicine but | like to be a doctor.

Anyway, | have no regrets. | am happy | am, I'm almost not anymore, I'm retired

now, private practice.

Q: Another question | have about, there you are in you're sort of student Kabbutz

(ph) as you describe it, and all these people who survived this experience. Do you

think that, and it sounds like you're all very diligent in you're studies, I'm wondering

whether because of the experience, because you survived, whether that was part of

the motivation to do this? To make sure you became a doctor? Or for the other

students to make sure that they did what they intended to do? I'm guessing maybe

people were even more serious than they might have been?

A: I'll give you a surprising answer, no.

Q: Really?

A: | Knew what | wanted to be when | was 13, war or no war. | knew what | wanted

to be. But the war forced me more of less to definitely not forget about it, and the

fact that | promised my Mom that | will. Although if | could have physically, been
able to, | would have done it anyway. So | don't believe that my personal
experiences had any bearing or influence. Although, | have to admit, that because
of the course of events after the war it came easy for me in terms of, everything was
facilitated for me. The Zionist organization, American Joint, they paid for that and |
didn't have worry about expenses, food, shelter. We even had

nights of fun, a little singing and someone playing harmonica
and so on. Little things. But | really don't believe that this reinforced it, tortured me
and so on. | would have done it anyway. | know myself. | know. | am a very
determined person. | would have done it anyway, yeah, unless | was sick or
something, but | would have done it. | think that my wife's Uncle that we discovered
after the war in Vienna, him being in New York, he wrote us a letter. | never met
him before. He was not my Uncle, he was a distant Uncle to my wife, when he
wrote us, "Don't you ever come back to the United States with doubt about
completing you're education.” And again, this was no doubt in my mind that |
wanted to complete it anyway, but definitely if | want to go to Israel, my wife felt,
which is not true, we're not in pioneering type of mood anymore. We're young but
still we're physically devastated. And to be a pioneer, go to Israel now, fight from
beginning. Again, she felt maybe life in the States would be easier for us. Do we

deserve a better life? Do we deserve a life better than our parents maybe had? |
don't have the answer to it. | would say, yes, why should we? But common sense
and logic convinced me my wife was correct.
Q: If | could stop you again for a second, | am curious about again you and you're
wife and also the people you're with now in this new environment. If you could tell
me a little more about, was it a big topic of conversation, whether or not to go to
Israel? Was there debate about that? Were there people determined to do it?
Whether you had discussions or even arguments about that?
A: Right. Well some group of our friends discovered some relatives in South
America, in Argentina and Paraguay. Another one discovered family in Australia,
distant family. They knew of. They never met them, like this distant Uncle that left
Poland before the war yet, before they were born maybe. They knew of them
because they remember their parents reading letters and so on. They seen pictures
but they never met them personally. To them they were strangers. So some of
them had friends or family in Canada, and so on. Some of them in the United
States. | would say the majority of us, perhaps more than 50% of the group, fell
with Israel. We felt more secure going to Israel. Not in terms of our lives, secure
terms in no one would attack you from behind again and hit you, be anti-Semitic is
all. You might be killed by a bomb, by a grenade, by an action, whatever, if you go

to army, but you're in your own country. No one can make a
to you, . But you Know we thought someday, sooner or later,
after the war we were optimistic. Things would work out somehow, sooner or later
there has to be peace. And we didn't predict what is going to happen, what is going
to happen right now? But at that time, and this was my idea to go to Israel. In Israel
medicine was not exactly a favored profession. But this was my idea to do. But
then finally my wife said, well, if we go to Israel and we won't be able to make it
there, how are we going to get to the United States? Almost physically and
financially impossible. But if we got to the United States, we cannot make it here.
We can always make it and they will help us, make illegal.
We can always do that. Which made common sense to me. And against my better
judgment though, | consented. We probably should consider that as a more
practical thing. And | betray my thought, maybe in a sense, that | was kind of
geared toward Israel. My years, the few years | was in Vienna and in school that is
where | am going to go. But the common sense prevailed and then maybe the
convenience, and we got older a little bit at that time, and we are looking for a little
easier life. No one says its going to be an easier life in the United States, which |
found out they, found it was true. It was not easy at all. | never worked so hard in
my life. But | was looking forward to it then, you know?

Q: To?
A: To come to the States.
Q: But you're saying you felt you betrayed yourself a little bit by not going to Israel?
A: Yes because | was geared to go to Israel. | just felt that's my place to go.
Mentally, you know? Although my parents were not Zionists. My Dad was a Bund-
ist (oh) which was a Socialist. And my cousin who was a young, what do they call
it? A Scha-bo-tin-ski (ph) man, you heard about it, it's ultra right. Nationalist. My
Dad, showing me my cousin when we're young, dressed in a brown shirt with a belt.
And the belt across his chest with a hat. Looked like a young Hitler uniform, like a
Nazi. He said, "Look at you're cousin. That's a Jewish Hitler unit.” And down on

My Catholic friends come into, to my parents it didn't mean nothing. They knew |
was Jewish and they knew they are Jewish. They were Yiddish speaking, but they
were very progressive people. And my father didn't believe in Israel. Free Israel,

they are. Fight for their right to work and so on. But this was before he became an
architect. | remember he was lucky, he was a more professional. Before he was a
locksmith, he was a worker. So maybe that's why he believe in it, all his colleagues,

for. But | knew. If my father would have survived the war, he would change his

you're going to be a whatever, a machinist, or a truck driver. | wanted to be what |

study. There was one professor of , who was an old, old Nazi. He
was about, close to 90 years old. Klein (ph) was about 88, 89. No one knew for
sure his age, he looked like 120. He lost three sons on the Russian Front. And he
flunked every Jew going for an exam in front of him. There was no, and these were
the smartest kids, flunked the first time. So |, there was another assistant professor
who was giving the exams too, but not while the old man was still there. And he
was never taking vacations. So | decided, a few of us decided, we'll go and get it
over with. We're going to flunk anyway. We didn't even study, we're going to flunk,
with or without studying, we are going to flunk. And sure enough, we flunked

"How are you sure that you're going to pass it?" And | said, "Well, I'm not sure but |
hope | pass it because | study now, if | didn't study and. . .", | told her the story.
She was very uncomfortable and very upset about it. She was very hostile. She
said, "| lost a son in Korea. And he would like to come back home, but he's dead.

that you have to do that? Or is it flexible? | didn't have anybody to talk for me in the
Embassy. | didn't have a lawyer, | didn't have no body, just myself. Me and my
wife. My wife was crying. And she didn't respond to us so we got out and walked
away, walked out. And this was the end of our dreams. We told our friends. They
said, don't worry about it. We'll go to Israel. So | was already set to go to Israel.
Sure enough, what happened? My good old professor got sick. During the end of
vacation. And sure enough, the assistant professor that we adored was in charge
of exams. | think it was something like the 3rd or 4th of October, | took the exam.
And sure enough | passed it. And | got my diploma with a formal ceremony, the

all my friends in Vienna. Didn't know to go to Israel probably. All of a sudden | got

bitter person because she lost her son. And maybe my age, | don't know, | never

problem at all." Even the first time. And this happens quite often, that things will be
changed, dates and so on. Asked me when I'll be ready to go? | said, | am ready to
go any time from now and just packed and that's it. And so we said good-bye to a
lot of friends. Some were disappointed that we didn't go to Israel. And some went
to South America, Australia and so on. We promised we are going to keep in touch
with each other. Because we were one family. We went through our youth, the
formative ages actually without our parents, without somebody from our direct
family. We create our own family. If my friend was like a brother to me, his wife
was like a sister to me. And we had two couples on the list were single, they were
always looking up at us. Although we are not the oldest, not at all. But we married
very young, my wife was less than 16, we got married in Warsaw ghetto. So we
had certain authority because being married, you know? It carries certain weight, at
least within our group. And those were the happiest days, outside my youth of
course. The second stage of my life. And here we are, we knocked at the door of
United States.

A: Yes. Well we were separated me and my wife. They took us to a camp in
Germany, in Hannover. Men were separated and women separate. We could see
each other during the day. Otherwise we are confined to separate rooms and so
on.
Q: What kind of camp was this?
A: It was some form of labor camp or something. It was not a concentration camp
before, no. It was labor. Barracks, you know? And it was like an office, big building
| remember. And | was a young doctor without any experience yet, just a piece of
paper, that's all. And | was assigned to check some of the immigrants who were
suppose to go to the United States, for the inflectional diseases or any lice and other
things, things like this. And we're waiting for arrival of a ship. And | remember the
name of the ship. It was a military transport ship normally carrying something like
300 or 400 soldiers or military men. But 1,800 people were on that ship. |
remember the wait for a small ship, General Blachfort (oh) was the name, you don't
forget that. And I've got to tell you, being on that ship, like in three weeks | think we
were in the camp before the ship arrived, and we boarded the ship. It took us about
10 or 11 days through the Atlantic, it was November. And the sea was very unruly.
We were sick, seasick, all of us. On top of that, | never ate ham with raisins. Not

not normally with ham. So when | just took this, tasted the ham, it got me sick to my
stomach. And anyway we survived the war, we survived worse things than that, so
we survived the trip too. And my wife's Aunt expected us at the port in New York
and was a distinguished lady, beautiful person. Elegant, never seen such elegance
for years. And turned out that she was instrumental in having us moved to a hotel,
to some kind of a gathering thing for the, old immigrants were going to. They pay
for the room, the hotel. There was a big suite. So with one room, some other
people, another room, you know? But it was very nice. They paid for this. And
then we got introduced to each other, with my wife's family. Her husband, who was
the one that | wrote to and he wrote to me. And after all those years he wrote very
beautiful Polish and my English was very bad, very bad. It was tragic. | didn't know
too much at all. And they had two daughters. And of course you invite you're poor
relatives to the house. They lived on Sth Avenue in New York. We are not properly
dressed for that kind of encounter but that's all we had. The only thing | brought
was a big case with books that's what | had. Otherwise, | looked like a rook sack.
Nothing. | didn't have no suits, no shoes, just what we had with us. And they had
two daughters, two beautiful girls. And | felt very uncomfortable and she introduced
us aS DP's. Displaced Persons. Like embarrassed that we are part of the family.

food in the hotel, | needed the money. | did need the money really. My wife very
soon got a job, right there in New York. She spoke some English, among
immigrants she spoke several languages, fluent in German of course, and in Polish.
And she speak Spanish too. And she could be like an interpreter, helping the
American to distribute the refugees to go left, right, wherever
they needed to go. Giving information, translating and so on. And she was paid for
it. Not much, but she was paid enough to get a bus and pay a bus. And | talked to
this Uncle whom | adored. He was really a fascinating person. And | took to him
right away, he showed me his heart, he opened up completely. A man that | never
met before. Never heard of me. His brother-in-law was a Director of American Joint
in Warsaw, prior to the war.

"You're right. | suggest you be, you'll find yourself better in a small town.” And they
send me to Jewish Committee in New York City with my dilemma. And | found a
very listening ear there in an older lady who listened to my story and she said, "You
know what? You should maybe stay in one of the bigger cities, in New York State
maybe, you'll be not too far from you're Uncle, just in case you need that contact
with him and so on, and maybe you'll find yourself even more comfortable and feel
more secure that way.” So | said, "Well, fine.” She asked me, "Where do you want
to go?" | said, "| don't know." She opened a book, an Atlas, a map. | put my finger
on it. Rochester, New York. She said that's a good city, University City, she said.
She made arrangements with Jewish Committee in Rochester to expect us there.

there was no subway. | mean, you could talk to you're neighbors, you know? You
could walk around. It was great. And after maybe a week or so of staying there my
wife got a job. Got a job working at Woolworth's. Selling donuts. Behind the
counter, selling donuts. She would bring in $6.00 each night, for nothing. And she
was telling me her experiences at work. She worked with a lot of African-American
and some minorities, but not as many that, well they were lower class American
people, white people, but some of them didn't even finish High School, and so on.
Very soon she was, she graduated from the University of Vienna, she was an
educated person. They discovered she was a very intelligent woman, so they
moved her right to the office with the bookkeeping department. And she was taking
orders and supplies and so on. | remember she told me one day they had some
device, you count together six donuts of sugar donuts, six donuts with chocolate,
they had to use the machine to add it up and she didn't need to. She added it up in
her head, and say it's $1.97. They would look at her, how do you know? Well |
figured it out. | don't know, my brain. Anyway, they discovered she's smart and
that's how she got the job. At least she got a paying job. Now | felt more insecure
than ever. Myself, | didn't know what to do myself. So talking to my benefactors,
the German-Jewish family that we stayed with, they say, "You know what? I'll

him and see what he suggests." | said, "Fine." "In the meantime, | have a lot of
German people, my patients, if you want to come and help me in my office here?" |
said, "| don't have a license yet to practice medicine here.” He said, "I won't let you
practice medicine. You assist me, help me with the x-ray department, x-rays and
moving the files and so on, and I'll pay you for it.” | said, "Okay." So | felt better yet,

me, "You know what? | made an appointment for you with the Chief of Staff. He
speaks a little German. He is Jewish, but he has a resident who speaks fluent
German, so he will be there when you are there." | said, "Fine." He brought me in,

He asked for lunch to be brought to his office there. We had lunch together. And
finally said, he released the resident to go away, and he said, "You speak German, |
understand what you're talking about. | maybe don't speak as good but | can
understand." And he was fascinated with my story, wanted to know all the story.
And | thought he felt guilty for some reason, | don't know why. Maybe because here
he has his whole family here, survived. | found out later he had a son of my age
who was a young doctor too, and maybe he felt sorry for me, you know? That! was
so physically, mentally devastated. And in the meantime | found out that its almost
impossible to get accepted in that hospital as an intern because American boys,
interns, medical students, have in advance, a year in advance, have to file their
documentation and so on in the hospital of their choice and its like a lottery. Either
they take you or not. The hospital has a choice of taking the best. So |, it looked

don't have to take an exam. You would have passed the exam, he told me. He
looked at my books and my and he said, you deserve to be
here. If you're English is going to improve you'll be okay. He was like a God sent
person to me. And my Archangel was the German resident. Wherever | was he

rounds in the hospital, | was first the Chief resident, then the middle resident, then
the Junior resident, then the Senior intern. | was finally the Junior Intern, | was the
tail end of the procession, and the nurses between. So | never even heard all the

patient, | made copies of certain things. And at night with one bulb on me, | would
look in a German dictionary, | was translating. That's how | learned medical
terminology, how to converse with a patient, how to make a diagnosis, what tests
you do, and so on. It was so different than | was use to in Vienna. But in Vienna, all
fairness, | never was an intern. | graduated and | was shipped right away. So |
didn't have the exposure to the hospital in the practical type medicine, you know?
But there was a double hazard here, no language and no experience. And | had
very little time to pick up my English. Anyway, but to make a long story short, the
two old ladies, they were beautiful old ladies, they taught me English. It was a
practical English, | never had a formal English education of course. But | bought a
radio from the first money | made, and my wife, and | listen phonetically to
everything. And not to music, listen to people talking. To get acquainted with. Oh, |
forgot to mention, when | lived in New York before we left for register, for twenty-five
cents | went to a movie on 42"¢ Street. | stayed there from 9:00 am until about 5:00
or 6:00 PM, my wife was working as a translator, right? | was there, not watching

we didn't eat meat for months, just vegetables, we couldn't afford any. But we were
not hungry for meat, once a week when | became an intern, we were invited to

experience of medical terminology, she had a job, worked for Blue Shield. They
invited her to a party. Same story. She told them | don’t feel good so she cannot
go. And so we kind of navigating for a few years, three years or so. Until | finished
my residency. And then it was time to move further. We discover our good friend
who's, her parents, my parents were friends when they were single yet, came from
Sweden, she survived the war in Russia. She came back to Poland after | left
Poland. And she found out that | was alive. So she found an Aunt in Buffalo, New
York. She contacted her Aunt who send the papers to Warsaw, but she had to
leave Warsaw, Poland to Sweden in order to be eligible for transfer to the United
States. That's how it was at that time. She arrived. She was in Buffalo, New York,
where her Aunt use to reside. And she found out | was in Rochester. And they
came to visit me with her husband. She lost her first husband, which | never met,
and the second husband that she met in 1945, they married, he was like my
brother. He's dead now. So we are good friends. After | finish my residency,
internship in Rochester, we elected to go to Buffalo, New York. At least we have a
very personal friend, bring back the old days, you know? Part of our happy days
yet, and part of our family really. Because her parents were friends of my parents.

When | was in Rochester, one of the pathologist at the University, when he heard
my story from the Chief of Staff, who was a surgeon, he said he heard | wanted to
be a pathologist. He approached me, if | would like to continue it. But in the
meantime, | lost the vision in my left eye during the war, when | was beaten by the
Germans, so | could not use a binocular microscope. And pathologists have to use
binocular. So this was, | was professionally handicapped so | said no. So | said,
but you know what? | have a micro-tomb (ph), if you want it you could use it for the
University. He said, you mean you have a micro-tomb (ph) set from Vienna? | said,
yes. You know, we've tried to get this for years but during the war we couldn't get it,
and so on. He said, definitely. Are you sure you want to get rid of this? | said, yes,
| want to give it to him. Not to him, to the University. | mean, the University was
good to me. They accepted me as an orphan, practically an orphan, and they
already put me on my feet. | wanted this, it's a little thing | can do. No way. No

Plymouth, for that micro-tomb (ph), you see? Okay.

Q: And then you were able to go to parties after that?

A: [Laughter] Now | could go to parties, right.

Q: As long as you've gone back a little bit, | want to, just before we pick up with you

in Buffalo, but | want to go back for a second. I'm very curious if you can remember,

you talked about coming over on the ship and coming into New York Harbor. I'm

very curious if you can remember the day when you actually first entered the Harbor

in New York? What was it like on the ship? What was it like coming into the

Harbor? Or you're first impressions?

A: | only remember one thing. | was sick from eating that raisins with ham. |

remember, or hot dogs with raisins or sweet things, marmalade, so | was safe from

this and plastic food and so on, but | see the Ellis Island,

which | knew all about. But this was a holiday, it was a very memorable day for us.

Maybe symbolic. | remember | said | don't know if | should believe in fate or not. It

was Thanksgiving Day. Still today, our Thanksgiving Day is a very important

holiday for the whole family. Children, us. And for us particularly. This was a

holiday, | don't remember what day it was, but it was Thanksgiving Day, | remember
that. And | don't know what to tell you. It was a huge port, the harbor you know?
Seeing all the immigrants, the refugees spilling out like, you know, on the port, you
know, and going through the control, which was nothing. They asked me what |
had, a big, huge case of books. | said, asked them if they wanted to open it and in
the few words | knew of English, he said, no, no, no. They knew we were refugees
in trouble, what would we have? Nothing. We have no clothes even. And then, but
they opened this and the trust, the people, you know, the official clerk like the
customs, | mean, it was not like searching us or asking personal questions, nothing
of that kind. Of course we had to go through health control. This was very strict
because there were many immigrants coming who had tuberculosis. In those days,
we had to have x-rays taken at the German camp before we boarded the ship. And
if there was any scar they wouldn't let you through. You had to stay, be treated
there in Germany, and you were just delaying you're arrival in the United States,
after some time, I'd say a year, six months to a year, you stayed in that camp there.
That's why | stalled. | talked to some doctors there because | was a little doctor
already. And our chest x-rays were negative, it was fine, so we didn't have no
problem with this. The only thing was annoying me, at the time the custom control
and so on, entry, legal entry in the United States, | had to sign that | was never a

Nazi. This was beyond understanding. | had to sign | was never a Nazi? Well later
| found out that some of the Nazis in the United States, imports from Balcan (ph)
countries, you know, false papers, there were many Nazis and many were
acknowledged by our government. | found out our government paid even some
Nazi collaborators in Europe, right after the war. The Butcher of Lyons, for
example, he was in solid with the CIA. Of course | understand she was being paid
like $50,000.00 a year. | don't know why. This was obviously after a certain period
of time, all the secret things were legalized. People opened the archives. That's
where | found out, reading things about it. But it brought back memories. | had to
sign that | was never a Nazi. | didn't know why.
Q: Did you ask the person? | mean, why should | have to sign?
A: No, that's just the procedure. To sign it. | would understand if this was, at that
time it wasn't even such a hostile territory, , not yet. They
were really partners in the war, you know, allies. But if | would have to sign | was
not a Communist, | understand. Maybe | would understand that. But that | was not
a Nazi? How could | be a Nazi being a Jew? Of course, even if some Jews were
collaborating with Nazis, there were some in the concentration camps. But not
because, the Germans used them only, of course, right? But a Nazi would never
allow those Jews to become Nazis. They just used them for their dirty work, that's

all. There were some Jews collaborators, of course. Jewish Police in Warsaw
ghetto, for example. But anyway, it didn't effect me that much, but they just, for
years, it just lingered in my mind. Why did | have to do that? Why sign it, you
know? And then | was wondering, those German Nazis you read here and there,
Ukrainian discovered now, Deb-yan-uk (ph) for example, you know, that was
arrested and sent to Israel eventually. He was exonerated, not by the United States
but by Israel. So that's, it stuck in my memory, | would say. But otherwise, the
American way of openness, people friendly, New York City, they are too busy
sometimes for us and that's something that bothered me, but | didn't blame them
because they are American, because the style of life was in New York. 10 million
people. | mean, nobody has no time to be too nice to you because, they are nice if
you stop them, but | remember in Europe | asked a cab driver to go to the highest

office for some information, about medicine and so on, and |
asked him how to get there. He said, "| don't know, but if you want to hop in my cab
I'll take you there." And | was thinking about it, you know? He didn't want to tell me
where to go, | was walking, | couldn't afford a bus. But he didn't want to tell me
where it is. But if | pay for the taxi, he would take me. There are few things, but it’s
a lower class people. But he was not hostile. He was not unfriendly. He was not,
he was himself, that's how he was. | learned to just ignore those things eventually.

But the few little things, | was talking in my mind, you know? But overall my
experience coming to the United States, overall, was nothing but highly positive.
And | am saying that in a truthful manner, that | don't recall any bitterness. | never
encountered any rough treatment or anti-Semitic even type of thing. Never had it,
no.
Q: How long did it take to go through the customs? Was it a few days one day and .
..?
A: No, this was almost a day. In fact, early in the morning, | think they started at
6:00 in the morning | think. Because | remember they walked us out quite early. In
the cabin, of course, we were sleeping in hammocks on the ship. We didn't sleep,
we were just vegetating in those things. And they, | think by late afternoon we were
all done. And they deposited that huge crate that we had and then | remember
meeting my wife's Aunt from a distance, dressed in a hat and so on, which was
maybe 3:00 or 4:00 PM at that time. It took us about six or eight hours maybe, at
the most.
Q: So actually when you got to finally leave there and actually go into the city it was
still Thanksgiving?
A: That's correct.
Q: It was still the holiday so the streets are probably empty, | guess?

A: There was nothing, there was nothing on the street, correct. The streets were
empty. The whole port was empty. There were some ships here and there but
there was no traffic there, no. We were not usual immigrants, not because, we are
displaced people so we came on government ship, you know, military ship. And we
found a lot of support from the crew. We were crowded, we were so crowded.
There was no room to sit because we were 1,800 people on 300 or 400 capacity
people, you know. And we didn't stay long there, of course, we were taken away
right away to this hotel.
Q: Were people having any sort of Thanksgiving dinner? Did you have that that first
night or not? Do you remember?
A: You mean that night when we, only on the ship. This was the day that we
arrived, is that what you mean? That's when we had the ham, raisins, the sweet
things which I, they told us it was because of the holiday. Normally we wouldn't get
it either. And | thought, gee, | wonder what they eat on non-holidays? | got so sick
from that. | love ham, ham | love, but not sweet ham. Not with raisins. But you
know for a man who was hungry so many years, you know? Surprising how |
distaste the ham with raisins. | was not hungry anymore really. In Vienna | was not
hungry. No, we were well fed and our American Joint was supporting us very well.
Q: So let's go back now, you're in, you go to Buffalo?

would never make it, forget about it. So | decide to get a job in the hospital, so |
worked in the hospital as a house physician. And | was getting nice money,
$250.00 a month, that was a lot of money. You could buy a suit, pair of shoes. My
wife could buy a dress, in a cheap store like Marshall's here or TJ Max. But it was
new. We never had new stuff before. In Vienna, we're getting clothes handed to us
from American Joint. Some of it's donated merchandise, you know, but we're
happy, lucky to get it. There was nice stuff but, and we met a lot of people in the
same boat as us. Some professional, some not professional. Some worked in the
factories, some worked in the offices, you know, from Europe. So we, since we met
people from my country, from Poland, you more or less cling to each other.
Different city maybe, but we're closer than anybody else. And they are about the
same age. So we had about a ton of friends, a ton. Many, many friends from

different parts of Poland. Some from Vienna even. And | met, in Buffalo, a friend of
mine from Vienna, who left Vienna, he was a journalist, to the United States as an
immigrant, a few years later. He didn't know I'll be in Buffalo and he was in Buffalo.
| met him once in a gathering of my friends, and we knew each other from Vienna.
So we dressed like one family, spoke the same language, although we all spoke
English at that time. Kids were little, about the same age, they played together.
The wives had something to do. But my wife, like our parents, felt she should stay
home with the kids. And by that time she was pregnant with my second child, | had
a daughter that you met today. And she was born in Buffalo. My son was born in
Rochester.

A: Gerald David. David after my wife's little brother that perished. That we think

survived the war, now, we just found out.

Q: Oh really?

A: We think we found out. We're not sure yet. We cannot find him yet. But we

found, and later maybe.

Q: Or, | don't know, we could just talk about it now, because let me just say for the

tape here, in you're video interview, you and you're wife, you both tell the stories of

how you lost him from this basically this fake resort that the Nazis tricked people to

going to and that. Now, when you did the video which was two or three years ago, |

believe, right?

A: Right.

Q: At the time you were both convinced that he had not survived.

A: Correct.

Q: So now you're saying you've gotten some new news?

A: About a year ago, we went to a friend of ours here from Warsaw who just found

her twin brother after fifty plus years. Not knowing he survived, by pure accident,

she found him. So we met him. And my wife talked to him and she said, you know

what? | have a little brother who was, when the war started she was seven, he was

at that time nine years old. He was born in 1933, her little brother was born in 1933.

So in 1943 or 1944, , | don't remember exactly now. And he
was at that time 10 or 11 years old. So he perished. So anyway, talking to this
friend now, he said, why don't you write a letter to such and such an office in
Warsaw, Poland? They have lists of many people, they survived camps and so on.
Why don't you do that? My wife did. Never got a response. The man who runs
this is an American boy who runs a certain foundation, | think the name is Linder
(ph) Foundation in Warsaw. Who send a list of survivors in this camp that we know
he went to. And his name, Arian name, not real name, Arian name, is listed as
survivor of that camp. This list is from dates from 1946. The year of birth is the
same. But the day and month is not clear, that's a copy of a copy of a copy. We
cannot decode the day and the month, but 1933. His name was Roman Kolvolski
(ph). So we wrote, we put everything in motion right now. We wrote to Israel. We
wrote to Sweden. We wrote to England, to Australia, to Switzerland, Austria,
Germany, to what they call the villa-goot-mach-home (ph), in case he survived he
might be collecting rent from German government. So we wrote to Israel, to
Avrasham (ph), wrote to Israel, different offices there. The Israeli Historical
Documentation Office who's Director is a friend of mine from Vienna. And when |
wrote him about the whole situation, he put every motion he could, the German
Consulate is a personal friend, so he is very much assisting him in trying to, Red

Cross, International Cross, , you name it, everything that's
known to maybe get some help from, we wrote to them. As a matter of fact we just
dedicated a plague for my parents in our Temple. My parents, my sister. And we
are already reserving a plague for her parents, her brother, when this come about.
So | eliminated his name from it. We only sent for her parents, we know they
perished. And we still hope maybe we'll find him, but it is a very difficult part now,
how to find him? He might have changed his name. He might be dead by now. He
could be now sixty-some years old, 1933, he would be 63 years old. He could have
died, natural causes. He could change his name to a different name. Maybe he
changes religion, does not want to have nothing to do with Judaism. | mean, there's
very, all these remote possibilities that we don't know. But we don't lose hope. We
do everything we can. We will go anyplace. My wife doesn't want to go back to
Poland, she would go to Poland right now if she would find something. So we're just
keeping our hands and our hearts open, that maybe he's alive and hopefully, all
those years that we wasted not doing nothing about him because, in 1945 we
registered in Poland and also they knew where we are and so on, and there was no
information. The Communists did on purpose, did not provide any communication
with people that survived the war. They didn't want that, see? So all the notes that

were left in Poland, in the different offices and so on, | understand they were

destroyed by the Communists, you know? So nobody will find out that, you know?

Q: How long ago was it that you saw this list with his name on it? Was it this year?

A: It was about one year. We see each other quite often now. The twin brother of

the young lady?

Q: Yeah, but you saw this list that showed the brother's name on it. How long ago

was that?

A: Oh, he mailed to us from Warsaw recently, about a month ago or so.

Q: Oh, just a month ago?

A: Yeah. And we started everything about a month ago. And my son, through the

Internet, he's a computer wizard, found some 11 people from that concentration

camp. And we've called them long distance, some are from New York, some from

Annapolis, some are from Michigan, but they never knew him. They did not know

him. They were older people, he was a little boy at that time. But it's obvious he

survived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946. Unless, by

sheer coincidence, the same first name, last name, Roman Kolvolski (ph) is

identical with his false papers were, not false, they were real papers, but on an Arian

name. We got it through the Polish underground, for a young boy who died and

they never recorded a death. So the birth certificate could be used again by Polish

underground to save people. That's how we got the birth certificate, from my wife's

little brother. So it's possible that someone else had the same first name, last

name. The same year of birth? That would be such a coincidence. So we firmly

believe that he's alive. Or he was alive anyway, we have to find out. So we do the

best we can. We just got a letter from Sweden, our friend who puts ads in

newspapers, and the Jewish organization there, and so far nothing. So, so far we

see no answers to it yet. But we're not losing hope.

Q: So that was just a month ago. After all this time, all these years, | mean it must

make you feel a lot of emotions | would imagine?

A: No question about it, no question about it. We don't give up hope. We live with

hope all our lives. That's what brought us where we are right now. If not hope, of

course, probably would take a gun and shoot myself. Why everybody was being

killed, you know?

Q: Does it make you feel any regret or sadness that maybe he was around all this

time? You just didn't know it?

A: Yes, guilt feelings. | feel very guilty, yeah. | feel guilty that, but searching my

mind, logically thinking, | don't know what | could have done. We did leave traces of

our life, our names, where we are going to be, where we are and so on. And that's

all we could have done. My wife found her Uncle by accident. One of our students

from? Poland. Oh, I'm from Poland too. So, you know, that talking to each other
turns out one was a_ survivor of concentration camp. That was

him. I'm a student. What towns are the students from? So he said, mentioned
several towns that, Warsaw, Lublin, Lublin. | had a cousin that use to be in Lublin,
then she live in Warsaw. So the student says, what's her name, do you remember
her name? He didn't remember her name. So he said, I'll tell you, we only have
one couple from Lublin. Her name is, he mentioned my wife's name. He almost
fainted. It's her cousin. My wife found a cousin from Warsaw who survived the
concentration camp. He was on a train going from Germany, from one town to
another town, by accident run into this student who is part of our group of students,
and that's how we found out each other. And since that time, through him, my wife
found out she has an Aunt in New York. He knew about the Aunt because his
mother was the sister of the Aunt in Europe. It was very close, you understand? So
my wife found out through the cousin that, he's still alive, in New York, of course we
are in contact with him, not as much as we should maybe but we are. He's very,

you know, but he was very helpful to us and still a family. It's her cousin. I'm sure

my wife would tell you more details about him in her statements, okay?

Q: Well | wish you luck. | hope you're able to...

A: We are praying, we hope that we will.

Q: Let's go back to you're story. You're first child is born in Rochester in, | forget

which year that you said?

A: Gerald David Horn. Then my daughter was Linda Sue Horn. She was born in

Buffalo, New York. She was born May 13, on Mother's Day at that time, it was

Mother's Day, May 13 in 1956. So she's, that's 40 years old now. Well we slowly

gaining ground and creating a family. We feel more secure. | had a job, | was

working in a hospital. My wife was a full-time homemaker. Two kids now. She was

three weeks old, she had pneumonia, she was hospitalized, we were scared we

would lose her and so on, but things got to be fine. One negative aspect of my

relationship in America with some of the landlords is when she was born, it was in

May, he turned off the heat. It was cold in Buffalo. Very cold. It was very cold, and

| come home with a newborn baby. She caught a cold. And I'm not trying to blame

our landlord for it. It was cold, the viruses, you know? But the temperature was

definitely below the normal. Normally people use to have their places heated at that

time. And when | complained, couldn't you heat our apartment with my newborn
baby that's just come home, she was a little low weight, he said, no, no. | need
you're apartment now because my family is coming and we need an apartment so |
want you to move out anyway. So | thought I'd wait until you're baby maybe gets
slightly bigger than | want to approach you on it anyway. So | seen there's no point
discussing things so | found an apartment not too far, through my friends and so on.
Very lovely apartment. They were American Polish people, not Jewish, that
nobody want to take a newborn baby in at that time. And they were the only people.
| was knocking the doors, from door to door. They accepted us with a newborn
baby. Until today, they are just like, my daughter still call them my grandma. She's
now, for eight years, this lady now, she lost her husband in the meantime. We lived
downstairs, they lived upstairs. Like a family together. And they, we worship them,
until today, she's a widow now. Were trying to assist her a little bit, we help her.
She remarried but they are up in age, sick and so on. So we, they are our dear, not
only benefactors, but friends. They're on the weddings with the kids, her children,
SO we are good friends until today. As a matter of fact, when Washington D.C. on
our testimony for the Museum, we invited by her daughter, this lady from Buffalo,
who lives near Washington, her mother's there, and stay with us for a few days.
She was raising our Linda, my daughter. So we are very close with them, yeah. So

studying and there were two States. Not each state approved . . .[End of Side 1 of
Tape 2]. . . foreign graduates at that time. Don't forget, this was a time after the
war. American physicians were in the Army and they needed doctors here so they
wanted all the doctors in the hospital, because there was no one to serve in the
hospital, there were not enough doctors. So when | worked in the hospital in Buffalo
they didn't want to let me go either. But | didn't want to build a future working in the
hospital until one day they won't need you no more, | want to be on my own. So |
had to take, make the license anyway. Besides time legally would have changed
and | wouldn't get a license to even work in a hospital, which eventually turned out
to be so. So | decided to quit the hospital. | was studying. And two states were
accepting foreign graduates, which one was Ohio and one was Illinois. So |
thought, well, let me take a trip to Chicago, take a look. | came to Chicago, | fell in
love with Chicago. | was on Lake Shore. | remember staying in a hotel on La Salle
Street. And | just looked around, a beautiful city. Downtown was beautiful. State
Street was beautiful in those days. Different than now. And | was given a letter of
recommendation by one of my colleagues, a doctor in Buffalo, to one of the doctors
in another family, personal friends in Chicago, so | had someone to talk to at least.

their pediatrician, an American born, and so | make already a few acquaintences.

His name was Bolick (ph). "Bolick (ph)?" The person jumped, turned around, didn't

Nobody knew his name, except | did because he was my classmate in Lee-boof

my family to this area on the basis of his promise, his word, that's all. His office was
in the suburb of Chicago, in River Grove. He helped me find myself an apartment in
Elmwood Park, which was about 10 minutes or so, 15 minute drive from his office

A: This house, yeah. We raised two kids here in this house. And we believed that
education was of utmost importance. All of us, the whole family, even my daughter-
in-law, son-in-law, all University graduates. My son is a physician, he's a top notch
specialist and he's an ophthalmologist, laser specialist. My daughter, Northwestern
University graduate cum laude. Both my kids. And my daughter-in-law is a
Podiatrist. My son-in-law is a Doctor of Philosophy, he's a Director, works for the
State, Director of School Systems. You know? And we have four grandchildren
now. I'll be married now 54 years December, on the 13th of December, fifty-four
years married to the same girl. We are very happy, very happy family. My kids are
my best friends and | know | am their best friend. And | achieved what | wanted to.

little brother. We'll look for little brother, little brother. He
was with us. We feel guilty because we let him go. But when the streets, we had
nothing, no place to go. When you can be shot any minute and find us, anyone
moving on the street at dark, you know, they are going to
stop, no arrest. They kill you. There was no one below us on the street, you know,

because the person in charge there, a German SS or somebody, his mistress was
my wife's girlfriend from school. And she took him with her. We knew that Sadie,
she goes there. We knew that's safe. But everybody wanted to get in there.
Everybody went there. If you had money you went there. And people who had no
money like us, they didn't accept us, so we didn't go.
Q: Yes. Let's say for the record here that this story and all is in you're video, so if
people ever want to go back and get the whole story, you and you're wife both tell it
in you're video. So | just wanted to put that on the record. Let me ask you a couple
of things. Are you retired now?
A: Well | retired from private practice already ten years, exactly two days ago, on
the 15th of August, which was ten years | retired. See, | was witnessing the
transformation of American medicine since | started to what it is right now. And |
didn't see eye to eye wants going on. And | have to live with that. And | don't think |
could stomach it. | could not understand it. | could not live with myself to, | was 26
years in practice, and | want to walk out with my head straight. | don't want to lie to
my patients. If | had to lie to my patients, they cannot be hospitalized, or if they are
in the hospital, to be kicked out of the hospital sooner than | would expect to, | had
to lie to them, that they are ready to go. Because officially, it's not the truth. And |

felt that sooner or later something is going to happen to them and | said, look, my
son is married, he's in practice. My daughter is married. And so, it's only me and
my wife, the two of us. We have a home, a little home. For the two of us, it's more
than enough. So, why should I? In the meantime, some of my competitors, a
young woman, spread the rumor that | want to sell the practice, to create a panic in
my patients. And | had no intention yet, at that time. | was just toying with the idea,
but one day a patient called me, he said, Dr. Horn, is it true you're selling you're
practice? You're quitting? | said, who told you that? Oh, Kathy, my neighbor goes
to Dr. so-and-so and this doctor, a woman doctor, told her. | said, no that's not true.
Let me find out why she say that. And | approached this woman doctor and she
denied it at first, but finally she admitted it. She heard some patient said something,
whatever, she wanted to buy my practice. So you know, it gave me the idea,
maybe it's the right thing to do. And that's what crystallized, one night | talked to my

which always was good in Catholic surroundings. And the other one, in City, was
old. You have to go to Northwest Hospital in the city. We should have the best
reputation, but resurrection to cover this hospital. So | approached the hospital and
they want to buy my practice. Thinking that by this, there was some restrictions at
that time with Media-care, they thought more patients would come and they would
fill up the hospital so they can survive. Because many hospitals closed up, they
couldn't survive. So they bought my practice and they sold everything. They sold

hospital needed somebody to do what we call utilization review. Which is exactly
what | touched up on before, in that we check on patients unjustly hospitalized,
unnecessarily. Meaning that they could have it done, the treatment, as out-patient.
X-ray of the stomach, you don't have to be in the hospital to have an x-ray of the
stomach, but in old days you were hospitalized because insurance paid only if you
were in the hospital. Otherwise, they don't pay no x-rays. So older people didn't
want to go into hospital, that's why insurance companies knew, if this old lady wants
to go to the hospital, | mean she's probably sick or she deserves that, right? But
today is different. You might be very sick but as long as you can do it as an out-
patient, they do as an out-patient. So | am like a medical policeman now. | am

if they are justly hospitalized or if they are unnecessarily staying in the hospital after
they did this job with their doctor. It happens quite often. Not to the fault of the
hospital or the doctor, fault of the families. It’s a big, legal type of a component
involved here, that the family is using legal track as a blackmail. Three daughters
have a mother in the hospital. The doctor discharged her, goes to nursing home.
They cannot decide which nursing home. $600.00 a day costs the room. She could
be in a nursing home already, the hospital will give you 24 hours to decide which
home. But one says one home, the other one wants the other home. Meanwhile
i's four days already, nothing done for the patient. And Medi-care doesn't pay for
the bill because nothing has been done. The hospital is loosing money. So we
enter here, talk to the family. Look, we're sorry, you have to take you're mother to,
otherwise you are liable for the bill now, from that day on, nothing done for you're
mother because you argue which nursing home you want to take. What's you're
decision? The day will come, | know, the girl is going to tell them which nursing
home to go to. Now you have a choice here. No, no, no. One day her death.
What do you mean? We're going to talk to my attorney, talking to my lawyer. Say

Q: Yeah. We can, after we're done with this interview, we can have our own private
discussion, the way the health care system is going. | want to ask you some other
things, just based on you're experience. You had two children in the ‘50's and now
they are grown, or whatever. And you are, you and you're wife are both survivors of
the Holocaust. I'm wondering when and how did you first talk about that with you're
children? How did it come up? How did they learn you're story? What, how do you
feel that you're relationship with you're children, how did that effect it, if it did’?
A: When we moved to Chicago it was about 1960. We moved to Chicago, my son
was eight years old at that time. We moved to this house. He made friends with a
little boy across the street, across the alley. We don't know, an alley actually, but it
use to be an alley there. Sunday they were playing together. The same age and
they are friends until today, all those years. One is in a different city right now, but
anyway, we were friends. We cling to people easily because, | don't know, maybe

we are more extrovert. Is it because of the war? | don't know. | constantly say to
myself, how would | be if not for the war? But one episode stuck to my mind. That
one Sunday afternoon, maybe 4 or 5 PM, his name was Mickey, the little boy was
Mickey. His parents, American-Polish decent, American born. They were playing.
All of a sudden, my boy, eight years old, comes and started crying. | said, why are
you crying? What happened? Sunday, | was home. | play with Mickey. So what
happened? Did he hit you? No, he didn't hit me. Well, why are you crying? Well
he had to go away, he says. Why are you crying? He had to go away, where is he
going? He's going to his grandpa. For dinner. His parents, his two sisters and him
are going. And | want to go to grandpa for dinner too. | said, well, you cannot go to
his grandpa because you don't know them and they don't know you. You don't
expect to be invited. He was an eight year old kid, pretty smart and understands
someone. He says, where's my grandpa? That's how it started. Until then he
never asked for it. | would never talk to him about it. And that's how it started. So |
told him that we have some pictures of my grandfather and you're grandfather,
you're Mom's father. And we have pictures of the grandparents, my parents and
her parents. The only picture | don't have is my sister's. Didn't have it. So | show
him the pictures and he asked what happened. He couldn't understand, what mean
Nazis and so on. But! told him they perished during the war, they were killed by

mean people, German people, Nazis, by Nazis. He asked what are Nazis? So |
told him, but he did not comprehend too much of it, you know? But he knew they
were dead, he knew what death means, being, going to the funerals and so on. So
he more or less was satisfied for a while only. But this was coming up more often
than, again, ask the same question, why can't | see my Aunt or my grandma? And |
said, well, they are not alive no more. Where is this, which cemetery are they
buried? | said, well, there's no cemetery. He says, what do you mean? How do
you be dead and not be buried? So how are you going to explain to a youngster
like this, you perish and you have no place to worship the grave. So | told him that
in those days there were mean people in Germany. They tried to kill all the Jews
and they killed my parents and you're Mom's parents and my sister and they didn't
bury them they burned them to ashes. And what they made out of ashes were
different things, fabrics, and they made soap and so on. And he couldn't
understand it. And this would go on for many, a few years until he was maybe, 14,
13 or 14, that's what really penetrated what happened. But interesting, since that
time, when we made our testimony at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my
son and my daughter all have their own copies. We have one. My son has three
copies. My daughter, they had three volumes. And they didn't want to talk about it
no more. But he became such an anti-Nazi. He just, it's had that influence on him,

that injustice was done to his grandparents, that he never met, that he missed in his
youth, you know? Because the happiness is, if Mom don't want to give it, ask you're
grandma. There's some, even T-shirts, seeing the writing on the, on that. If you're
parents are too strict with you, you're grandparents always allow you to do what you
want to do. And he always felt that he missed something on it, you know, he
missed out. But then he would never talk about it, he never wanted to touch the
subject at all.
Q: When did he stop talking about it with you? When he was younger or recently?
A: No, no, no. We didn't talk about the subject since he was about 14, 15, | would
say. He knew all about it, since that time he is quite acquainted, politically
orientated with what he knows all about, he knows Holocaust, and he was in
Washington. And my daughter was recently again with my wife in Holocaust
Museum, so they are acquainted. He does not want to discuss it. He refused to
talk about it because he has, he tells me, | said why don't you want to talk about it?

And all of a sudden, on his own initiative, he elected to have a father/son once a
month dinner. Father/son only. Me and him going after work or some meeting,
together, without his family, without my family, only me and him. | think what
triggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away, also a
survivor, from Germany, a German Jew. And his son is my son's best friends. And
the trauma that his friend, the son of my friend, went through made my son realize
how fragile is life. Don't take it for granted. We're here today, and don't know how
long. And he wanted to enjoy my presence, our presence, as long as he lives. He
doesn't want to tarnish anything with any bad memories, anything, what will come
up with the discussions and so on. He knows the history. He knows the story of our
survival. He has the tapes in his possession. So sooner or later, he is just delaying

he's older. He is now 43, 44. He's an adult man. But he doesn't want to face up to

it. And I'm not going to disturb that kind of a status quo.

Q: Okay. You know, I've read some in the past, some books of, sort of biographies

of Holocaust survivors and families. And in some families the situation has resulted

in some forms of tension, you know, where the children feel an extra burden

towards their parents. And in some cases, the parents, because of all they've lost,

you know?

A: How would you explain this? | mean, | am at a loss to understand that.

Q: Well, you know, every family is different and different people react in different

ways. When people interact, anything can happen really. It sounds like, from what

you're describing, this is, nothing like this has ever come up here.

A: No, never. As a matter of fact, | did expect maybe there would be pity or a little

sorrow with what | had to go through. My children, our children, consider us heroes.

And | told them, I'm not a hero. Whatever | did to survive was not deliberate. It

| didn't do nothing to deserve this thing. | am here and | am a very fortunate

all cherish life and want to make the best out of it. We try not to waste our life on
ridiculous things. On something that my, life is short. Or even if its long, its not long
enough. And if you waste you're time in life and do certain things that you might
regret, you cannot turn the clock back again. So there was one thing that | got from
my parents, from my father, he was a strict disciplinarian. And | always respect him
for it. And | was penalized many times when | was a kid. | never held it against him
because | always deserved it. Whatever | got | deserved it. He loved me in his own
way and | knew this was love, that's why he disciplined me and so on. | never
complained. | took it like a man. And | cried when | was little. | cried but | never

Warsaw ghetto. So she was fascinated with it, she contacted me here and | made
several trips there. And | told her one more time | will be glad to do it again, but
right now...
Q: I'm curious about that whole encounter you talk about with the young woman
who didn't believe the Holocaust. I'm wondering how, when something like that
happens, when that's over, how that makes you feel?
A: There were other discussions with other people and very little input from the
Black students. More input from the white students. There was input from a white
man who was standing by, joined the whole thing, nothing to do with the school,
nothing to do with me, | never met him before. Turned out that he was a Polish, not
Jewish, victim of Holocaust. He was released from one of the, liberated from one of
the concentration camps as a Polish laborer. He lost his whole family. His father
was Official, some official in Polish government, first one to go. The Germans first
took the dangerous people, who are people with Army, officers, you know?
Lawyers and so on. Intelligencia (ph), you Know? And he was there and listening to
this whole discussion and he raised his hand. | didn't Know who the guy was. |
found out later about his background. And he said, | listen to the whole story. |
don't know this gentleman, pointing at me, but my name is so-and-so and | live now
in Aurora. | live only few blocks away from the University. He introduced him, who

he was. He was a retired man, he worked at one of the factories there, a factory
man. And he had a number on the arm and he is missing some of the toes. He
was beaten in the concentration camp by the Germans, he was not working enough
and so on. He was beaten and he lost his shoes, well not shoes, they were woolen
type of a thing, with a pipe. They smashed his toes and then given no medical
treatment. They became gangrenous and fell off completely. And then the inmates
treated him a little bit, secretly and so on, he saved the foot actually. But he said, |
don't know the man from Adam, but you don't have to believe me either. Just
because | have a number doesn't mean nothing. My father didn't have a number.
He's dead. By the Germans, by the Nazis. My brother didn't have a number, he
was shot by the Nazis. You will see his corpse, you say well he died natural death?
Or somebody robbed him maybe? Well, that's not true. But no one is going to
force you to believe it. If you don't want to believe it you never will believe it. But
the day will come, you'll find out, it is the truth. Just like Dr. Horn said about the
slavery. We all know it was true. There was slavery, of course there was. But see,
amazing that you who didn't live in the days of slavery insist there was slavery. And
here you're confronting a person who lived through the Holocaust, my
contemporary, right? He don't believe me, that | am there. And this was a dilemma.
And | don't know how much | convince . . . [End of Side 1 of Tape 3]. . . her of

course, but | think the teacher, the professor, Palmer, was very impressed with this.
She called me many times. She was very impressed. Just because she had

type of a confrontation. A person was there. Which was,
eventually, the younger people when they look at the videos and that's all. Look at
our faces, our voices. But they'll be computers or so, but they are not human being.
Q: Let me ask you one thing, | was just thinking about where we are. You're in
Lincolnwood, which is as far as | know a few blocks from Skokie, basically?
A: Right.
Q: A lot of Jewish people here and a lot of Holocaust survivors here.
A: Right. The first march against the Nazis was here.
Q: Well | was going to bring that up. In the late 1970's when the Nazis were trying
to march here, you were here?
A: Right. Correct. | was here.
Q: What was that like?
A: | didn't face up to it. We didn't Know nothing about it until later. As a matter of
fact, the leader of this Nazi was a Jew. You know about that I'm sure?
Q: Well you know, I'm not from this area, so | didn't know. | think | remember this
vaguely that he is like part Jewish or something?

A: Part Jewish, right. His father was Jewish, not his mother. According to the

Jewish laws, if the mother is not Jewish you're not Jewish. But there was a

passport of his father, passport, he went to Israel then, it was in Hebrew. | mean, it

was Palestine at that time, it was a Hebrew in English. And

his faith was Jewish. So his father was Jewish. He was very antagonistic, that

leader of the Nazi, when people found out his father was Jewish.

Q: Yes. So my question is, | mean, here you are living in this area. It's, by then it is

30-some years after the war. You've made this whole life. You had these horrible

early experiences. Here you are in a suburb of Chicago and you have these people

parading around in Nazi uniforms and whatever. I'm just curious what that must

have stirred up, even if just the memories?

A: Yes, no question about it. At first, | couldn't understand it. | was aware of it. In

Canada there is an anti-hate law. | couldn't understand why we don't have that kind

of a law in this country. That freedom of speech, that's fine. That's a beautiful thing.

But there has to be a limit to freedom of speech. If you have freedom of speech,

well, it can lead to hate, lead to crime. Like burning the churches right now, the

black churches. | don't want that freedom of speech if people can face up to me

and hate me and talk to me in derogatory remarks and so on and being the same

thing, what | remember now as younger. | feel, that's the country | came for? To

me this is, until today this is very hard to swallow. | understand it but it's hard to

swallow. Because Canada, it matters too, they do have an anti-crime, anti-hate law.

Even Germany, the birth of National Socialism, has anti-crime. We have, this guy |

forgot his name, it starts with "L", American, printing the Neo-Nazi literature, here.

He can do it freely without any punishment. Bring it to Germany, he is arrested over

there for breaking the law.

Other: Hello?

Q: Hi.

A: And to me this is beyond understanding. Until today, | am not in total agreement

with the whole thing. | don't Know what to do about it. But | feel that freedom of

speech is very important, yes, but not to the situation. By

leading to total chaos and . Of course, you have a right to do

those things. By the right gives you the right providing you do things that doesn't

hurt nobody else. You're right to express yourself, yes. Peacefully. Not to kill

someone, not to cause a riot or something like this. Marching, you can peacefully

pass through or convince legislators to pass laws that you believe in and maybe |

don't, if you can go through that, that is the way, that's all right, that's fine. But to

hate, slander and so on, or a Neo-Nazi march, | don't believe that they deserve that

privilege. | mean, freedom of speech. | feel that we are reaching, that America

living today is not the same country that | came to. It's different. And | guess | need
to get use to it but I'm not talking about the crime now, that things were not present
at that time, drugs and so on. I'm talking about the political innovations and change
of climates and so on. And | feel those things, people are misinterpreting the
Constitution. They use the Constitution for their own personal beliefs and they bend
the Constitution they way they want to. They convince our lawmakers of bending it
too. Talking about separation of church and state and so on. But people now try to
bend it and so on because they live in the country where the Pilgrims and so on
what to escape execution and so on. So they do understand, that's why we have
this separation, because where they came from there was no separation, that's why
they had to leave the country. They were persecuted. Here in this country we don't
support the working, believe what you want to believe, as long as you don't go and
kill somebody, don't hurt somebody else. You can believe whatever you want to as
long as you do no harm to somebody else. To children particularly. Even if you
teach or preach certain dogmas, that's hurting the children. | feel that our
Constitution is abused by a certain group of people. And you will find always those
groups of people who find people who fund it and the money talks, you know? Who
really have a purpose in the whole thing, quietly and so on. And they undermine our
Democracy. I'm worrying about it. | am. | worry about my grandchildren. How safe

are they in this country now? And will they be as safe as | was when | was a kid? |
don't know. I'm not sure. Even my daughter, wanting to be a veterinarian, and |
was told not in certain terms. If you're not a farmer who donate money to the vet
school and if you are not a born American, forget about it. And then they didn't want
to tell me if you're a Jew, just don't bother. See? But this was the life, true life was
in those days. But not that our government, our country believed in and promoted it.
But the people did. | was amazed with the amount of anti-Semitism in this country.
Amazed how much. This little village, before my arrival here and right after the
Second World War, there were signs on the front lawn, dogs and Jews not
permitted.
Q: When you came here?
A: When | came here, right. The owner of Lincolnwood (ph) was a German. He
owned huge farms, multi-millionaire. He died of course. His park is, Prussels, the
park is named after him. He subdivided, blah, blah, blah and so on. There were no
Jews here before. was the first, where Jews were there, before
Lincolnwood (ph) became. But slowly, use to making in-roads and some of the
gentlepeople didn't like some Jews so they started selling their houses. So the
Jews were buying it. So like the Jews living in Rogers Park, going to the suburbs,
you know? Different minorities comes in. And that's what, | understand, | was not

here at that time. | never seen that sign but | was told by my colleagues, Jewish
doctors, who never could live here. They told me, no one wanted to sell them a
house or a plot to build anything. They were unwelcome. There were a lot of
churches, there was never a Synagogue here. Now we have some.
Q: | want to go back and ask you one thing. You told me the story about when
you're son was playing with the neighbor kid and then came in and he was about
eight or so then. And that's the first time the subject came up. I'm just curious, that
you and you're wife are both survivors. You're here, you're having kids. Did you
ever have any discussion about how you would handle this subject with you're
children? Because, you must have thought it was, it had to come up at some time?
A: Yes, it did. Of course, | imagine | did in a minor way, but | don't remember in
detail. But | Know one thing. It came up once when they were older, when we got
some invitation to some symposium on children of survivors, something like this.
They had to undergo counseling, through psychological evaluations, and so on. |
never found that need in my family. | never, not that | am blind to it, | am open to
any kind of a consultation or if there is need to it. | never felt my kids were deprived
of any security, love, affection, ect. Just because what we went through? We
never, we didn't dwell on this maybe. Maybe in the very early, formative ages of our
children we didn't want to hurt them. And this was a cruel thing and we wanted to

spare them to those things. We felt that maybe in time when they are more mature
and more responsible and more secure then we can have a dialogue on this thing.
But, interesting enough, when they became more mature they were not open to this
kind of discussion at all. They, my son don't want to talk about it. And | try for many
times to approach him and so on. And he said that | know you're story, | Know
everything. It hurts me inside. | don't want to talk about it. But he's a very well
balanced person. He is not, outward he is not, or psychologically, a handicapped
person, emotional or otherwise. He is secure. He is responsible. He is very well
known physician and consultant, you know? He has a secure family. He has two
lovely little girls, daughters. He married a gentile girl who is of German extraction. |
don't know how many generations, three or four generations, so, but he made it
clear. He fell in love with her, she fell in love with him. As much as hurts him, he
will never hurt his parents and marry a gentile, German girl unless she converts.
She said, look, it's not my fault | was born of German extraction. Which is true. But
her parents and grandparents and great-grandparents born in this country,
Americans. The German is only by the name, name was Griner, which is a German
name. It could be a Jewish name too. The fact that | am not Jewish is not my fault
either. But this they are, they are people too. But | am nota religious person. If this
will make you happy. And she converted. She is more Jewish than my wife. Friday

she lights candles. Kids go to synagogue, to temple. We join synagogue because
of my kids. To same synagogue. They joined but they waited four years to be
accepted. It cost a lot of money, like an introduction there because there was such
a waiting list. And that synagogue, they want to belong. One day we got a call from
the Rabbi, Dr. Horn? Yes? You're son is a member of our congregation now. We
would like to meet you. | said, will you want us to be a member? He said, well, we'll
talk about that. We want to meet you in person first, want to know you're story. |
would like to listen to you first. And we set up a date and we met in his office there,
in the synagogue. He roughly just got our story and so on. He said he would be
more than pleased if we would join the congregation. | said, first thing | cannot
afford that money that my son paid you. | am retired, | said, and!|... Money is not
the issue here, he said. You don't have to pay nothing, he said. | want you to be in
the congregation, you're son is in the congregation with. So we belong there.
Q: How about with you're daughter?
A: My daughter-in-law or my daughter?
Q: No, you're daughter. And you told me the story of what happened with you're
son and how the whole subject of the Holocaust came up and how it's gone with
you're son. You haven't mentioned you're daughter. How is that?

A: She is more open to it, we talked many times. My daughter, she went to Israel
more than once, twice or three times already. She wants to go through it again.
She is more digging into the past than my son. She is different person, totally
different. She doesn't dwell on it though. No, she doesn't. But she is, she grabs
whatever little she get from the history, from us, the parents, grandparents, so on.
She wants part of it, you Know? She is clinging to it. But she is very secure too.
She doesn't dwell on it, she doesn't talk about it all the time and so on. Among
friends and so on, they all Know she's proud of who she is, daughter of survivors.
And she's not embarrassed. Because | know some of my friends children are
embarrassed about their parents being survivors. That's sad.
Q: They are embarrassed?
A: Embarrassed that their parents are survivors. They are poor, they were poor, no
families. Because their friends are rich and American-born and so on. It's a social
level type of a thing. They are like a lower kind of people. But this was not with our
kids. No, | never, they always stood their ground and as | say, | feel that we are
very well leveled families and my kids had no need for it. But someday, | am sure,
after | die, |am sure my son is going to keep his promise. He is going to look into it
in details. The only thing | might say, yeah, but it would be better if you do it now

The tape won't be talking to you. You have to listen to the tape, that's the only thing
you get. Information. But with no dialogue. Here, you've got you're father still alive.
But he doesn't, he said, Dad, | cannot do it. I'm sorry, | cannot face up to it. He
wishes he could take away from me the hurt and he cannot do that, no how. How
can you do it? Not talking about it? That's what he thinks, by not talking, it is
minimizing my hurting. | don't dwell on it either. | went back to Poland, | went back
to my High School. | was the only Jew in a Catholic High School. | play violin in
church choir in Poland. And some Polish people, all the known facts about Poles
during the war, what they did against the Jews. | won't repeat it because they were
the willing executioners of Hitler. But they saved my life and my wife's life. They got
me out of Warsaw ghetto, Polish people. Underground, Polish underground. For
money, of course. It turned out to be no money, we buried, you know the story from
the tape. We had a buried treasure and it turned out to be someone robbed it.
Anyway, Polish people help us survive. And they definitely helped me. Totally
unselfish, with any profit, no profit, nothing. So! am very, | have to be fair to it. And
| went to Poland, | wanted to see my High School. | was treated beautifully when |
was a kid there. | remember when, it was the most beautiful years of my life. My
parents and my school. And my High School still stands. And | found the book with
my picture in it, in the High School. | didn't know their fiftieth reunion, | didn't know

they were there, but that's all. There's no trace left of nothing. | went to other
concentration camp, Auschwitz, etcetera. We went to the former ghetto area and
Warsaw where some Jewish people sell remnants, old, a few of them left over yet
now. Pitiful sight. And my wife cannot face up to it. She cannot do it. She hates
them so much, what they did to the Jews. She doesn't want no part, she doesn't
want to listen or speak Polish. She doesn't want to read Polish books. She doesn't

of peace you can get.

Q: When did you go back to Poland?

A: About 16 years ago. The only time.

Q: So, 1980?

Q: Just before a lot of things started to change there.

A: Communists were still there.

Q: Yeah?

A: And | felt very uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable with the passport and the

border, on the airport, they opened my passport, looked at my picture, it was empty.

It was a new passport. They are looking for Israeli stamps. They were, oh, they

were, if you weren't from Israel they wouldn't let you in. You know, the stamped

visa. So | made sure | got a new passport. Clean, nothing there. And the guard

didn't say a word, just look at me, look at the empty pages. My picture, empty

pages. He the pages through, empty, blank, blank, blank. He look at me,

he look at this line of people behind me, maybe fifteen minutes like this, standing

and waiting. And | was getting a little uncomfortable. Because | heard nasty things

about the Communists in those days. Didn't say nothing. Gave me a stamp.

Without saying a word, pointed out to go through and I'm in Poland. But it was not

the most comfortable feeling | had. Now is different. Now they have so-called

Democracy, but in today, Jews and Poles, | just got it today. | read an article,

Hungary, Romania, Estonia, giving back Jewish property to owners. Poland, not

even . Don't even prepare a bill or law to return the Jewish property to

them. So they grabbed what the Germans took away, robbery, and they keep it.

See, Poland. So there's many things that I've got to be proud about being born in

Poland, but things got, | am not a Pollack.

the classes were not open. The secretary was there and so on and they called the

the bench that | sat on as a student. He understood it very well. And he said, didn't
disturb me. And when | left | gave him $10.00. He didn't want to take any money
from me. He said, it would be sacrilegious, he said. He knows how | feel. He
knows, he knew my story, you know, Jewish and so on. | was the last graduate
before the war, then the school was closed. And there was only, when the war end,
when the war started, there were only two Jews in my class, my school. | was one
and another Jew who lives in Chicago right now, found him after the war, he
survived the war in Russia. He was in my High School. The only second Jew. And
in those days, there was nothing but school, education. Where you get it, is it Jesuit
school, other school, you get the education. And this was a drive, there was such a
healthy competition. The cousins, everybody had to outdo the other one. | played
violin, | was painting, so my cousin was doing the same thing. We tried to out do
each other. It was such a healthy thing. There was nothing else to do in those
days. There was no fun like the kids have today and going to different places,
things, parks, if you go to park they beat the hell out of you. If you were Jewish and
went to the park, the students, University students, beat the Jews in the park. They
let the Jews in. Oh, | was beaten up many times. But not by my colleagues. My

the false papers during the war. They helped me. With the risk of their own life.
There was a Gestapo walked in the room, who was sitting there. He was a
shoemaker. | took my shoe off, he said, here, give me a shoe, he put a nail in my
heel. And the guy said, these here are two Jews running? And the lady said, what
Jews? There are no more Jews here. What Jews? Jews are gone. So he left. It
was the mother of my classmate from that High School. They saved my life. That's
one episode only. And there are many of them, | didn't describe all of them.
Because | cannot do in three hours or four hours of testimony, to give you all the
details. They were righteous gentiles, yes, they risked their life and | question, are
we Jews, would we be ready to make that sacrifice, to threaten you're life to save
another Pole? | don't know. | ask myself the same question, could | do that?
Somebody would say, oh, they are dumb Pollacks, that's why they did it. Because
smart people would not do it. But that's wrong to say that. There are many
intelligent people who done it, because that's the right thing to do. There are certain
rules in life. Is it a right or is it a belief? Is it a religion, maybe?

what they believed was the right thing to do. And | cannot knock them, those
people deserve their place rightfully in history. That's why | cannot generalize all the

Poles. But obviously Hitler Knew where to build those concentration camps
because he found a lot of helpers.
Q: Right. And who to make guard too. You've mentioned Ukrainians a lot in you're
video tape.
A: Right. Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, yeah.
Q: We've spent a good time, we've actually been talking now for almost three hours
and | want to thank you for you're time. And before we turn the machines off, any
last thing you want to add or anything you want to say that hasn't come up or that
you want to expand upon?
A: It was not a very happy note. | don't need the world to learn anything from the
Second World War, from the Holocaust. Learn nothing. And history repeats itself.
However said it before was right. It is going to repeat itself. I'm from, start from old
ages, middle ages, same thing right now. When Eichmann asked Hitler at the

Conference in 1942 in Germany, before the Final Solution, when Hitler
outlined the plan, what he wanted to do with the Jews, he was agreeable but he
said one question, to Hitler. | think | mentioned that in my testimony too. Do you
know anything about the Armenian Holocaust? And Eichmann said, no. See?
Here you are. There was Armenian Holocaust. Turks annihilating Armenian people
in 1905, | think. 1905, 1915 yeah. Kids were never taught in school about, they

were not in Turkey. But in Germany, in Poland, | was never taught that. | just found
out about it when | heard this thing. You know what? After the Second World War,
after Holocaust, fifty years, seventy-five years, people forget about it and they will
not like to discuss it no more. And | am reaching that point now, | see that. Letters
to the editors, | see people saying, we know, Holocaust, Holocaust, Schmol-o-caust,
enough, enough, enough. How much longer are you going to talk about it? Well, |
hate to say that, from the lower class of people, not very intelligent people, would
write that kind of a letter to an editor, you know? But they resent, non-Jews dwell
on this kind of thing. And they don't want Jews to dwell on it either. But they don't
understand the pain inflicted by that. How can you forget that? As, who said it?
Viselle (ph)? Forgive? Yes. Forget? Never. True. You might forgive, | never
forgive. | won't forgive, | won't forgive. But what does it mean, | won't forgive? So |
pay my own choices, | don't want to associate with German people and so on.
There are innocent German now, you youngsters today, it's not their fault. They are
not, because they are grandchildren of the perpetrators. But to children | might
forgive, little children. My generation Germans | won't forgive because they are
willing witnesses and participant in the Holocaust. Do you read the book by, what's
his name? Lucy? Lucy? | have the book upstairs. | have it upstairs. By Galahan
(ph) is the name, | forgot his name. Hitler's Willing Executioners. Proving that all

German participate, willingly or unwillingly. Getting support, getting fur coats,
getting radios. They knew it belonged to somebody, they knew from whom. By not
being anti-Jews, but they are accepting those things, they are participant in it, they
were quiet about it, they were peaceful. So, it is so true. | agree. | read the book.
Very difficult book for me to read. Difficult because it's the professor from Harvard
who is the writer, a highly intelligent man and psychologist. And | had to read it like
a science book, not a novel. It's hard to digest it you know? But it's so true. So |
believe today the people didn't learn nothing. It is repeating itself right now, this
moment. And it's going to repeat itself again. One stops, another country starts
murdering their own people. Is it Rwanda? Is it Bosnia? Is it in Libya? Or is it in
South Arabia now? | mean, wherever you turn around you will find the same thing.
Know it's going to happen again. And that's rather depressing fact that | have to
learn to live with it. The only, maybe positive out of it is that my life is going to end
soon and | probably won't be witness to another Holocaust maybe. But | worry
about my children and my grandchildren. That's what | worry about, yes. | am
rather pessimistic. | am an extrovert, | am. And basically | am a person with hope
and so on, and in this respect | am rather pessimistic. Yeah.

Q: It's surprising actually given so much of what you're story has been like,
especially since coming over here. And you've said yourself, in many ways, you've
had very good fortune and you've had a very good life.
A: | still have a good life. That's not this.
Q: But it's interesting that you're final conclusions are so pessimistic.
A: | am a little influenced maybe by the newsletters | get from the different
organizations, Jewish organizations, with pictures. What's going on now. Certainly
| was not aware of it, even now, the degree of anti-Semitism in this country is
frightening. It is frightening. If | listen to all this, wnat | read. Granted, maybe some
of the organizations, they try to influence the readers by getting more donations, by,
you know? Send us more money to defend our cause and so on. But the fact is,
there are still very many anti-Semitic type of a thing...

A: .. . publications. You can find it everywhere. And that's what disturbs me. Not
that | stopped being an optimist, no. But | am a little on the pessimistic for the future
generation of my children and so on. And | don't like what | see right now with the
ultra-rightness and the church trying to turn to politics as one, introducing the Prior
to the school, | am definitely against it. | feel the beginning of the problem, you
know? | am nota blind person and | came from there, where this was there. And
they want to do something that | came from. And it is going to lead only to another
catastrophe, sooner or later. It's going to be the Blacks, or the Jews, | don't know.
Q: Well thanks again for spending all this time.
A: Thank you very much. Thank you for you're time.
