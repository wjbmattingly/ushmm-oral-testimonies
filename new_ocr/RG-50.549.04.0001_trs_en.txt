Beginning Tape One, Side A
Question: Okay. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr
collection. This is an interview with Harry Gelb, conducted by Regina Baier on
December 13", 2001, in Mr. Gelb’s home in New York City. Mr. Gelb is the son
of Holocaust survivor Regina Gelb -- Regina Gelb, who has been interviewed for
the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s oral history collection. This
interview is part of the USHMM’s post Holocaust interview project. The U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for
making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. My first two
questions are sort of questions that we’ll ask everybody. They are kind of formal,
but easy. Give us your full name and your date and place of birth.
Answer: My name is Harry Gelb, G-e-I-b. I was born on May sixth, 1956, and I
was born here in Manhattan, in Washington Heights on -- it’s upper Broadway,
near Dighton Street.
Q: Were you named after anybody in particular?
A: Yes, I was named after my paternal grandfather, who died about two years
before I was born.
Q: Was he -- did he die during the -- during the Holocaust, or was it in America?

A: No, no, this -- my -- my father is born in America, and his father was also born
here, a newly, newly new -- I believe his parents are newly arrived on the Lower
East Side, perhaps at the e-end of the last century.
Q: Okay, let’s talk about your parents a little bit. When you think back -- we’re
doing this chronologically, I think, which 1s easier in some ways. We can always
jump back and forth later.
A: True.
Q: When you think back as a small boy, how do you remember your parents?
Difference in -- difference in personalities, wh-what kind of -- when you think back,
describe them to us, when we haven’t seen them.
A: Mm-hm, well actually they’re both alive, so when I say -- you ask, how do I
remember my parents, 1-it’s -- 1t’s an unusual question. I -- I remember them, seeing
them, talking to them virtually every day now. If you’re asking about the
differences between them, and -- and to compare and contrast them, they’re --
they’re quite different people. I think the most salient difference that one would
notice even at first blush is that my mother is clearly European born, you can tell
that just by her accent, and my father is an American Jew. A-A -- their personality
types are also quite different. My father is a r-reasonably calm and excessively well
organized person. My mother, although she is -- is quite well organized, is a very

intellectually driven person with a -- a constant thirst for a-acquiring new
knowledge and reconsidering and re-evaluating things in her life, both the
significant and the trivial on a day to day basis, but her mind is constantly focused
on that sort on of endeavor.
Q: I guess my -- my question was sort of trying to first of all get you back into
childhood, but also trying to bring out whether or not your perception of your
parents has changed over the years [indecipherable]
A: Oh, I can answer, I do -- I do not think that my perception of them has changed
over the years. I think that w -- the one thing one can say about each of my parents,
even my father, who is American, and brings with that certain cultural baggage, 1s
that they don’t -- th-they don’t move with -- with the changes and ebbs and flows of
American society. They’ve been very consistent in their own personality types
throughout my life. And the things that they were concerned with or dedicated to at
the time of my birth, a-and mine and my brother’s upbringing continue to this day.
They -- they behave and -- and dress actually, very much in the ways that I recall
them having done so when I was a child.
Q: Interesting. Talk about your brother a little bit. Who is -- what’s his name, when

Q: -- when he was born, and -- and what -- what type is he?
A: Mm-hm. My brother’s name is Paul Gelb. Right now he lives in Albuquerque,
but obviously he lived here in New York with our family when he grew up. He was
born April 13" of 1960, also here in Manhattan, which makes him four years
younger than me. And I remember very well the time when he was born, and having
been sent for a -- a sleepover to a friend’s, while my mother gave birth to Paul. I
remember him coming home from the hospital and having a -- a reasonably good
memory myself, I recall details of our upbringing very, very well since the day he
came home, because that was his fourth birthday and my memory goes back even
farther than that. And is there anything in particular you’d like to know about him?
The way he looks, what his interests are?
Q: Describe him -- just describe him a little bit to us. Sort of as -- over -- against
how you think you are, how you see yourself, maybe.
A: Physically my brother, 1-it’s obvious to anyone who would see us, is -- 1s -- he’s
a very -- looks very different. I am about six feet tall, weigh about 155 pounds, I’m
a very thin -- thin framed person. And my brother is about six feet five inches tall, is
physically built -- the only way I can describe him, as I’ve often said, is that he
looks like, literally like the statue of a Greek god. He works with his body, meaning
he’s a landscaper and he designs things and works with things outdoors, heavy

things, all day. And I’m sure in large part because of this, he’s able to keep up the
tremendous physique that he has. But he’s always been a very physical person. I’ve
been a very much more intellectually oriented, and my brother has always been
oriented towards sports, the great outdoors, and using his body and keeping it
moving and doing things at all times. Very different type of person from me. We
had very similar education though, we went to the same grade school, the same
junior high school and the same high school. And we went to similar colleges. We
went from PS 187 to junior high school 143, both in upper Manhattan. Then each
of us went to the Bronx High School of Science. And then I went on to Hamilton
College, and four years later, Paul went on to Saint Lawrence University. Both of
those are smaller, upstate New York institutions.
Q: Did you get along when you were small? Were you kind of friends, did you sh --
did you share things, or was it difficult because you were so -- such different
people?
A: I think actually we got along very well. There’s always sibling rivalry, and any
pair of brothers who are four years apart who say that they don’t have periodic, or
sometimes unrelenting battles between the two of them would be prevaricating. I'll
-- I’]l just say that we -- we got along just fine. He, because of his great physical
abilities was often welcomed in with my circle of friends, almost as a co-equal, so

that he could so-called hang with them, and play sports with them, and they looked
at him very much as one of their own friends. I’m sure that he -- that being
welcomed by -- by my friends made his life a little more easy, or fun.
Q: It’s a -- it’s a good chance, actually, to go back into your childhood, because you
said your memory goes back so far. I’m -- my own does, too, which is interesting, it
does in -- sort of in glimpses. Put -- give us those glimpses that you remem -- give
us a few, sort of impressions from what you remember, what it was like in your
house, what -- what do you remember?
A: Hm. Well, I rem -- first of all, looking at our general family constellation, some
of the most interesting and fun things that -- that we did, meaning Paul and I did as
children, was to go and visit our relatives. My mother’s family, each -- she has two
older sisters, one sister lived with her family in Vineland, New Jersey, the other
sister lived with her family in Toronto, Canada. And travels out of New York
City, to different venues are always interesting to any child. What was very unique
-- visiting Toronto, of course, is a foreign country, but I don’t think there is
anything in Toronto that particularly grabbed our attention when compared to our
lives in New York, except that it was always fun to see our cousins and that sort of
thing. Going to Vineland was very interesting because at that time, our aunt and her
husband, our uncle lived on and owned a chicken egg farm. And they had dogs and

rabbits and people who worked there. And imagine coming from Washington
Heights and then all of a sudden being allowed to play in -- in a wide open farm
with your cousins who took you around and showed you all of these things that
you’d never been exposed to before. You had the run of the land, you had the run of
the animals, you had the run of the house. It was really a big adventure. We also had
a paternal grandmother, who lived in Asbury Park, New Jersey, very, very close
to the beach. So when we visited there it was always pleasant for my mother to take
us over to the shore. It was only about four or five blocks directly to the beach, and
we could go on the little rides, and -- and get a salt water taffy, and orange-ade, and
waffles with ice cream and hang out on the shore, and if the weather is right we
could even go in the water. But we could go to the beach any time of the year, as
long as it was clement weather. That was always a fun thing to do. My brother and I
had free run of the neighborhood i-in Washington Heights, that’s near 190" Street
and Fort Washington Avenue. In those days -- and these days as well, but in those
days it was a very, very safe, and the children could wander the neighborhood
freely, enjoying everything from the Cloisters Museum in Fort Tryon Park, all the
way through playing ball in the schoolyard as most children would do. So we had
quite a range of things to keep us busy in that neighborhood. Fort Tryon Park in

particular providing a spot where a lot of different sorts of recreations and
adventures could be had.
Q: Do you recall -- before I -- we talk a little bit more about what it was like at
home, in your home atmosphere and so on, do you remember the particular
circumstance or event or so when you first realized, understood, that your mother
was what we now call a Holocaust s -- a Holocaust survivor?
A: There was never a time that I can recall that I was not aware that she and her
sisters were Holocaust survivors. As a matter of fact my mother has always made it
a point, and I know this not only because she did it, but because she said to me, and
has reminded me that she has done so, to be very honest a-a-about her background,
and I’m quite certain knowing her, that she told us things in an age appropriate
manner, meaning age appropriate as far as we children were concerned. But we
have known as -- as long as I can remember, what our roots were.
Q: Do you remember partic -- a particular sort of w -- how she talked to you about
it, or do you -- its -- an-and your response, your feelings? How do you -- how did
you f -- how did you feel?
A: Well --
Q: What -- what was your response to it? Sort of, curiosity, fear, anger, resentment,
what sort of happened?

Interview with Harry Gelb ”
December 13, 2001
A: Speaking for myself, I -- I -- then, and now, my reaction is always curiosity and
further curiosity. I in no way ever resented this. As a matter of fact, since so many
o-of my mother’s relatives, and -- and of course her extended circle of friends were
survivors as well, this was not something that seemed in any way aberrational or
different. This was just something that I accepted as the norm, that some of the
people in the neighborhood I lived in, in Washington Heights, had come over after
World War II as survivors, as compared to the many, many other, particularly
German Jews who settled along Fort Washington Avenue in the late 1920’s and
1930’s, before the war. Many of the children in my neighborhood were the
descendants of that group of people, as well, but basically those are the types of
people that lived in the neighborhood where Paul and I grew up.
Q: Did you perceive any differences that might be attributed to Holocaust
experiences among your aunt as over -- against your mother?
A: Well, I think 1-1t’s -- they’re -- both aunts, and you have to remember that my
mother, a-as you might know is the youngest of three sisters. My -- when the war
broke out, as my mother was born in December of 1929, and the war broke out in
September of 1939, my mother had not even celebrated her 10" birthday. So her
outlook on the war, both then and now, 1-1n retrospect, is I’m certain quite, quite
different from that, let’s say, of her oldest sister, who 1s significantly older than she.

My -- my mother’s oldest sister, 1f I’m correct, ha -- was already attending
gymnasium, and my mother would have just been a grade school child at the time.
So the -- the -- how do we say, perspective that -- that a -- a child who’s 10 years
old would have on the outbreak of war is certainly different than a high school child
would have. My -- I-I -- I’m sorry, I just -- I was wondering what it -- exactly it was
that you’d like me to get at, because it’s such a -- a broad area, and --
Q: Well, I was just -- we can -- can leave that alone and bring it up later --

December 13, 2001
A: I think that the amount of -- of discussion that any o -- that either or -- of her
sisters, and compared to my mother, that any of the three girls had about Holocaust
activity, or what ha-had happened to them, I mean, in the Holocaust, 1s more
reflection of their -- just of their basic personality. For example, my oldest -- my
mother’s oldest sister, my oldest aunt, I was just going to say, is just slightly more
reticent, but that’s just her -- her -- just innate character. She’s always willing to
discuss, and always was willing to discuss their past. She married a survivor, and
someone that she had known overseas, of course, and she -- he was a -- he was a
guerilla fighter, as was the husband that my mother’s next oldest sister married.
They were all survivors, so within the family, issues of discussing their past are
certainly -- were n-nothing to hide, this was part of their joint and several
backgrounds. And actually, my father would be the only one who would be viewed
or -- I shouldn’t he would be -- he could have been, but he wasn’t viewed as an
outsider, having been born here in Brooklyn and grown up in New York City. It’s
a -- but my father fit right in with the family, he -- he’s just a -- a very gentle and
welcoming sort of person and -- and that is reflected in the way that these five other
people treated him and accepted him. The sister -- my mother’s middle sister, so to
speak, the sister that lives in Vineland, New Jersey, and her husband have always
been, out of the three sisters, the most involved in Holocaust related activities. As

you might know, the sister who lives in Vineland married a gentleman names Miles
Lerman, who eventually became the chairman of the Holocaust Memorial
Commission and Museum in Washington, D.C.. So all of our family has always
looked up to Uncle Miles and his activities as exemplars of -- of what one could in
reference to remembering or commemorating the Holocaust. But that doesn’t in any
way mean that I wish to give short shrift to the concerns and activities, both of his
wife and of my mother and her oldest sister, who live in Toronto.
Q: Her name is Hania?
A: Hania. Her name is Hania Wilson, her -- people call her Anna. And the sister
who lives in Vineland is Krysia, but people call her Chris, their last name is
Lerman. And I forgot to say that the uncle that I had, by marriage of course, in
Toronto, who is now deceased, his name was Adash Wilson, but he was known in
Can-Canada as Adrian. And the uncle in Vineland, who is the hol -- Holocaust
Memorial Museum is Miles Lerman.
Q: Di -- I -- I gather yet that you did get along with your cousins, but --

and did you talk about, amongst yourself about the experience of your parents?

Interview with Harry Gelb :
December 13, 2001
A: There is -- looking back, there was some discussion about it, but more in latter
days, more since the time I would be college age, and in a way that isn’t really
reflective of how we were raised. Seeing our cousins was basically seeing our
cousins and having fun. Of course, visiting Canada, those cousins from the oldest
sister were a bit older than me and Paul, and I’m sure they looked at us as -- as their
nice, very much younger cousins visiting from New York. But we were entertained
when we visited there, largely by my mother who -- who took us around and made
sure that Paul and I had fun things to do. However, when we went down to the farm
in Vineland, my cousin David, who is the younger of Krysia and Miles’s two
children, and was a boy as well, and was also involved in boy’s scouting, was a
hero to me and Paul. He led us through adventures on the farm, and -- and starting
little campfires and cooking potatoes and hot dogs and chasing the chickens through
the coop, and taking fresh eggs [indecipherable] under the nest and just generally
having a lot of fun. All of the other three cousins, meaning his older sister and the
two cousins in Canada are female. So I -- I suppose one could say that Paul and I
had a bit of a closer relationship to David at the time we were children. Also, when
we were growing up there came a point where David’s older sister, since we saw
th-this family more often, they were living in New Jersey, David’s older sister was
away at Brandeis for four years, and then went to Stanford for graduate school, so

we didn’t see her for long periods of time. But David was around a lot when I was
in high school, and David was at Harvard. My first ever college field trip was to
visit David up at Harvard. That would be in the spring of 1972. And that was a big
adventure for me too, it was a big trip away from home.
Q: Okay, let’s go back to home. That was a good -- and if you want to take a sip of
water, you can do that. Yeah, let’s go back to home and see sort of what kind of
values were stressed? What -- with regarding t -- with regard to education and
religious upbringing and so on. What was important to your parents and what --
what -- what happened?
A: With regards to education, I can speak both for my mother and for each of her
two sisters. They were extremely devoted to the -- the value of education and a
classical education at that. Each of the three sisters a-and their spouses as well,
drove all of us cousins, so to speak, to a-achieve academically as much as we
possibly could. And virtually all of us have graduate degrees and we all did
excessively well in school. We went to excellent schools and did well in them. I’m
proud to say. Education, though, isn’t only what one does in school. My -- my
mother, as -- as well as her two sisters exposed the -- their very -- their respective
children to all sorts of -- of -- both performing and fine arts, to make sure that we
had a -- a breadth of knowledge and familiarity with the -- the humanities, that

would not make us simply narrow academics, but to make us a broader and more
fulfilled and self-fulfilling people.
Q: Yeah, your mother actually said in her interview that the emphasis as far as she
was concerned was not so much on succeeding, but on broadening their horizons.
So you would say that’s how you would see that -- how -- how you see that too,
right?
A: Absolutely, it’s both. It isn’t yust -- ne -- she -- I -- | agree with her, even in her
own self estimation. I think that she both was very interested that -- that we
succeeded o-on both a substantive level and of course competitively, which don’t
necessarily go hand in hand. And also that -- that we became more familiar with
other cultures and other histories that weren’t our own. And I know her two sisters
felt exactly the same, because you can see it 1n -- in the way their children are now.
Q: Was that a burden to you sometimes too, that you felt that you had to kind of
move on and make her proud, or was it something that just sort of came naturally to
you anyway?
A: I don’t think that it was a burden that I felt that I had to make her, in particular,
proud. I think that any student of any parent, who 1-1s at all competitive in the ac-
academic environment, wishes to succeed and knows that his or her parents will be
proud, but I don’t think that that was the moving force that would make me work

harder in school. I just wanted to do well in school so that I could learn the material
I had, because that was basically my job.
Q: Was it equally important to your father, or was there a slight difference in -- in
emphasis?
A: I’m -- I’m sure it was equally important to my father, but in every household,
each parent fulfills different roles. Some overlap and some are very distinct a-and
separate. In our household this is just -- education of the children and the
supervision of it and the guiding of 1t was something more within my mother’s
province, than within my father’s, although he certainly would help me with
anything from mathematics to French. But when look -- when looked at from the
big perspective, it was always my mother who was the one who was involved in all
of the school activities for the parents and in support of the children. In scouting
activities my father helped, but my mother helped when we were in the cub scouts,
which was what the -- what parents did in those days. But 1t was my mother really,
who was more involved with us in making sure that we academically achieved what
we could.

Q: What -- what -- how important was that, and -- and what -- kind of what
coloration did it take on?
A: I think that my brother and I were raised as American children in that the
primary focus of our upbringing was not on the fact that we were Jewish, but that
we were growing children that needed education. This is not in any way to
minimize the role that religion played in -- in Paul and my upbringing. From our --
from my earliest recollection my parents have been members of the Hebrew
tabernacle of Washington Heights, which is a synagogue that used to be on 161“
and Fort Washington, but around 1972 or ’73 moved closer to their home, to 185"
Street and Fort Washington Avenue. The Hebrew tabernacle is a -- a synagogue or
a congregation largely made up of the German Jewish émigrés that I had referred to
before, but there are quite a few people like -- like our family, who came from other
backgrounds, but who were Jewish as well. My cousins all ri -- belong to
synagogues and in each of their families they were very, very ab -- involved in their
religious upbringings. Even more particular is the zi -- Zionistic upbringing and
religious upbringing that went hand in hand with that, that my cousins in Vineland
enjoyed as children. While I was very, very involved, for example, as an adolescent
in -- in boy scout activities at wa -- a-at the same time, in tandem with my shul
activities, but still I -- I was very heavily involved in boy scouts. Both David and

Jeanette were deeply, deeply, deeply involved in Young Judaea. And each of them
became national officers, they worked in camps. As a matter of fact, my cousin
David met his wife at a camp Young Judaea in Texas when he was a counselor
there many, many years ago. Many years, obviously, before they got married. But
as aj -- as a general matter, all of our parents had us involved in a religious
upbringing, but the Lerman family was very involved in Zionistic ac-activities as
well.
Q: What kind of friends -- who were your friends? Jewish in background, or a mix,
or sort of who were your friends and did you talk -- did they know that you were a
child of a survivor?
A: Everyone in the class knew what -- where everyone’s parents came from. For
example, one of my classmates in grade school, Steven Guttman, was not a child
of survivors, he -- but he was from a German Jewish family that had come over just
before the war. He was very proud though, to say that his maternal grandfather had
-- who was obviously Jewish, had served in the Kaiser’s army in World War I, and
was a wounded and decorated combat veteran, having taken some sort of shrap --
shrapnel in the belly, and had been very proud of the service that he had offered his
-- his government, meaning his country, Germany, during World War I. They
subsequently emigrated to the United States in the 1930’s, and what happened

thereafter is indeed history. But Steven was never embarrassed and was actually
proud to point out his grandfather’s history. On the other hand, there were other
children in our class who were not Jewish, there were other children who were not
even from our neighborhood, who were bused in during the desegregation years.
One of tho -- one of my classmates then, with whom I’m not in touch now, but o-of
whom I’m very proud, is now the chair French horn -- lead chair French horn at the
New York Philharmonic. And he’s a student who was bused into our neighborhood
for desegregation purposes. Another one of the children that was bused in
eventually became a leader of the New York Black Panther party. So there were
quite -- was quite a variety of children, but most of the children in our class were
Jewish and lived in the neighborhood, but a few were Italian, a few were Irish, a
few were Greek. It was a regular mix of Washington Heights children that
attended PS 187. My brother, being only four years younger than us had basically
the same sort of balance in his classes as well.
Q: What your -- what was sort of your impression of s -- during the school years,
high school, sort of the Holocaust education? It didn’t exist in the way it exists now,

A: By the way, I -- I did want to state -- you asked me if I knew other children who
were survivors. Yes, I did, and the few of us all -- we didn’t walk around talking
about this, but we all knew each other’s parents and knew where they had been and
our parents all knew each other. But I don’t think it bore in any way on the way we
interacted as children. We just were classmates in school, and we did everything
that all the other children did.
Q: Well, it’s only interesting if you talked about differently about -- if you t -- if that
issue came up in a different way than it came up with others, that would be
interesting.
A: These -- these sorts of things came up, but only when -- I-I’d say when I was
over -- over the age of 17 or 18. In other words, after -- I graduated from high
school early, so after I got out of high school and went to college and people
became freer in talking -- or more interested maybe in talking about these things,
and I -- I ki -- will tell you later a bit about some of the other people that -- that I
knew and the things that we discussed in -- 1n those years. But as a child, this is not
something the -- that the children used as a -- as a conversation item between them.
Now, you were asking about -- about how I view education. When I went to the
Bronx High School of Science, you can imagine that like me there were many other
children of survivors. And of course in those days, Bronx Science was heavily

Jewish as a general matter, whether that be American Jews or Jews from other parts
of the world, and not necessarily Holocaust survivors, per se. Then, at that point
there was no formal Holocaust education class or program at Bronx Science,
although I distinctly recall that these issues were discussed in social studies classes
as -- as one would expect them to be, in the context of studying history. However,
shortly after I left, the Bronx High School of Science opened what I believe was the
first high school Holocaust study center of its kind in the United States, and it’s
there to this day. I actually happened to stop by Bronx Science last week cause I
was in the neighborhood on business, to see one of my old history, or social studies
teachers. And indeed, the center is -- we actually mentioned it, the center is still
there, and the high school, though, has changed, and what -- what is wonderful
about having the Holocaust center there now is that the student body 1s made up of
children who might not know as much as we did when we were children, the reason
being that Bronx Science, like Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech is now heavily
Asian. And overall one could say that whereas the school was largely Jewish when I
went there -- of course, there were -- there were hundreds and hundreds of other
children from other backgrounds, whether they be -- were Protestants or Catholic,
Irish or Greek or -- or -- or black Americans or Spanish. Now, the vast proportion,
maybe not the majority, but a vast proportion of the students hail from Asia. And

you can see that the minute you enter these schools. It -- this is just reflective, in
many ways, of the changing ethnic face of New York City. And it’s a wonderful
thing to know that this center is serving these children’s educational needs.

sense at this point to continue with your education. So, Bronx High school --
Science school, and then where do we -- where did you afterwards?
A: When I graduated Bronx High School of Science, I went to Hamilton College
in upstate New York. Earlier you asked me about my mother’s ideas about
education. One of the most interesting aspects of -- of -- of my outlook, and the
counsel that I give to my children and others nowadays, 1s -- is my mother’s attitude
about going on to college. I think it was a given with every family in our
neighborhood that their children would go on to college and probably graduate
school. It wasn’t just that. Many parents, including my wife’s parents, believed that
a child should maybe live at home or stay in their home city, etcetera, when they

went to college. It’s just sort of a continuation of high school in many ways. My
mother was insistent all along -- she wasn’t insistent meaning she w -- she would
not ha-have -- put me to the guillotine had I decided to attend Columbia, or NYU
or Fordham. You can rest assured, I’m sure she would have been quite proud and
supportive. However, from the earliest years my -- my mother encouraged me and
Paul to think about going away to college. And why was this? She was v-very o-
open about why this was. When my mother came to America, she came under the
supervision and the guardianship of her next oldest sister, which is Krysia, and
Krysia’s new husband Miles. And when they first came to America they lived
together as a family in Brooklyn, and then Krysia gave birth to my cousin
Jeanette, and my mother was involved in raising her. And then there came a point
in time, the exact date I don’t recall, but that’s not really relevant, when Miles and
Krysia decided to move to Vineland, New Jersey, and my mother was to stay on
in Brooklyn and attend Brooklyn College. She had attended Thomas Jefferson
High School first, wh-when she first got here, graduated and went onto Brooklyn
College. While my mother was there, she received a very, very unique offer to teach
Polish in a counterintelligence training program at Indiana University in
Bloomington, Indiana. Now needless to say, my mother, I am sure, did not know
much, perhaps just a little, little bit, but not know much at all about what Indiana

was or even perhaps where it was. But the offer included the opportunity to both
teach and to finish her undergraduate education, at I -- I -- I’m certain a -- a
financially acceptable situation for her, given the fact that she was basically on her
own. So off she went to Indiana. And she always told us as children how fondly
she looked back on her experiences in Indiana. The point of what I’m saying is
specifically that she always told us how important it was 1n her upbringing, to be
exposed to a different cultural and intellectual milieu, while she was in Indiana,
from the one she would have been exposed to had she stayed here and attended
Brooklyn College and finish her education there. And -- although of course,
immediately after graduating from Indiana University, she did indeed move back to
New York City, she always told us and still does to this day, how highly she valued
the years that she spent there. Both the fact that she ha -- got a wonderful education,
but also because she met so many different types of people from so many different
backgrounds. The kinds of folks that came from all over America, particularly in
Indiana, middle America, that she would never have seen here in New York
during those years. And I suppose that that in large part informed the way she
counseled me and Paul about the -- maybe not advisability but about the weight we
should give in -- in thinking of out of town schools. And you’ll notice that both
Paul and I went off to out of town schools. And the end of my four years at

Hamilton, I did move back to New York City, but I moved back here at that point
largely because the law school that had selected me, which was New York
University was a fine institution. If one, for example, in Boston, had accepted me
that I wanted to attend, I would have gone to Boston, and perhaps eventually
relocated to New York. As a matter of fact, now that I think back on it, I probably
would have. But it wa -- the selection of venue for graduate school was not made
with the same considerations that my selection of college was.
Q: Why law school? Why law? In what direction did you want to go into?
A: I always felt as a child that my interests, or that my -- I shouldn’t say that my
interests, that my intellectual proclivities and leanings were more in the humanities
than in the sciences or mathematics. And although to be honest -- an-and I don’t -- I
don’t say this to brag, it’s just a statement of fact, I did exceptionally well in both
the sciences and re -- and almost as well in mathematics. Better than most, actually.
I never found that I had much interest in anything other than the biology of
medicine, in particular, but I was -- had really very little interest in physics, or
chemistry, or pure mathematics or computers, or whatever other sorts of sciences,
so to speak, were available to me a-as a -- intellectual or academic endeavors. On
the other hand, I -- I was always, always, always drawn to history and literature and
language. And to this day, even while in the practice of law, I’m a voracious reader

and alternate reading books of nonfiction and reading books largely of classical
literature. Incessantly, I read every day on the subways and before I go to sleep, in
order to continue my self-education, even while practicing a very narrow area of the
law.
Q: Before we continue, you had -- you -- wh-which direction in law did you
choose? What -- what did you want to become and what did you become?
A: I am reasonably unique among the -- my fellow graduates from NYU law school
and the class of 1980, in my having gone into what’s called public interest or public
service law. Technically I’m in public service law, meaning I’m a government
employee. But even while in law school, I was not drawn at all to the rather
lucrative world of corporate or business law. Coming out of NYU law school, the
doors are largely open to those wishing to practice those areas, and many, many,
many of my friends went into those areas, and are doing financially quite well, I --
i-intellectually, we don’t discuss. It’s just the job, it’s the same as running any other
business. I always felt socially impelled t-to find something that I could do that
would be of some good or service to others, and -- and I felt a natural affinity for
government service. I eventually dis -- sub -- I -- now I-I mean it’s sub - sub - sub-
specialty of the law, but I started when I -- I -- well, actually, when I was -- let me f

a union labor law litigation firm, but I found that I enjoyed litigation, it matches my
personality type very much. And when I graduated from law school, I worked in --
in an admiralty insurance and personal injury litigation firm again, while still
looking, all of the -- this time for a public service job that would suit my own
personal, social and intellectual needs. I eventually was made a job offer by then the
human resources administration of the city of New York, which was then the parent
organization for the agency that I still work for, which 1s the New York City
administration for Children’s Services. And since New Year’s of 1983, ve worked
exclusively in child neglect, child abuse and termination of parental rights litigation.
I also have a -- a side specialty of immigration law as it pertains to children who are
aliens, who find themselves in New York City foster care. That’s sort of a sidelight
of my own, but it’s all within the same job.
Q: I don’t want to ask this as an oversimplified question, but I noticed that some
children of survivors who decided to become lawyers, became defense lawyers,
because they kind of identified with the victim. Now you became the prosecutor,
but of -- of -- of people who abuse children.
A: Yes.

A: I -- I think that might be reaching a bit. I think that even were my mother not a
survivor, given the values that were imparted to me and Paul as children, an area of
law that is somewhat related to social work, as mine is, would be the type of thing
that I might have enjoyed doing. On the other hand, I -- I -- I -- well, actually it’s
not on the other hand, I really don’t see much of a connection with -- with defense
lawyers as well. I think that you -- you -- one might find some degree of social
concern in children of the Holocaust, but for example, my roommate from law
school, from my first year there, who 1-is the child of a survivor is now a partner in
a very large corporate law firm, and he has been with them exclusively since we
graduated from law school in 19 -- in 1980. Actually, and sadly, his firm was one of
the firms that was blown out of the World Trade Center, number one World
Trade Center on September 11". And fortunately, all but one of his co-workers
made it out of the building safely. And th-th-that’s a wonderful thing. But a -- I -- I
actually should tell you, it’s a very interesting story involving this young man. The
summer before I attended NYU law school, I -- I had subscribed to live in their
dormitory at NYU so I wouldn’t have to commute from Washington Heights. |
received a -- a note in the mail that -- you know, one of those, your roommate will

and I, although he lives about a mile from my parents, his family belonged to the
same synagogue and at the high holy days, their pew, it was the same -- we shared
the sa -- the two families, the Bauers and the Gelbs were assigned seats in the same
pew for years and years. Also, Larry and I, although he’s a year older than me,
attended day camp together for years and rode the same camp bus, although we
weren’t close, because we lived about a mile apart and traveled in different circles
of friends and went to different schools, we knew each other reasonably well from
those two contacts. So I was very, very pleased, I called him, he received the same
letter on the same day. And it was -- 1-it was a really, really strange coincidence that
we lived together, and while together we got to know -- obviously we’re sharing a
room for a year, we got to know each other much, much better. His -- to answer a
question about him that you had asked me earlier, Larry’s father came to America,
a German Jew in the 1930’s. Larry’s mother, also a German Jew was incarcerated
in Theresienstadt, a -- a survivor, e-e-eventually in Auschwitz, and -- but she, like
m-my mother, survived the war. What makes them very, very different, meaning the
two mothers, is the degree to which they were willing to go in discussing their

wartime experiences. And all through law school -- at the time, Larry, of course
knew what his mother’s background was, but his mother would tell him that
basically -- she basically had -- had given up on religion, although his father wa-wa-
was quite committed, because she -- and this is Larry’s -- I’m paraphrasing
Larry’s words, she felt that -- that God must have given up on the Jews in order for
such a thing to have happened to her and to her entire family, which was lost. It was
in more recent years, since the death of Larry’s father that he started to talk in
depth with his mother about these issues. And he asked her why it was that she
didn’t talk much about these things. And she s -- and she laughed and turned and
said, what do you mean? She said, I’m willing to talk about them, you just didn’t
ask me enough. In -- in the last few years, I-I’m sure that his discoveries about his
mother’s background have grown geometrically, and that this is -- this 1s a -- a most
in -- most intelligent and forthcoming woman, and I -- I just found it interesting that
for whatever reason, Larry and I grew up in -- in basically parallel lives in
Washington Heights, and Inwood, during our formative years, our knowledge
base may have been the same, but the amount that Holocaust issues was discussed
in the house was quite different. The result is the same. I think we have about the
same consciousness, and about the same regard for our parents a-a-as each other,

our upbringing with -- with a roommate over the course of an entire year.
Q: Is there another example that you have that whi -- that you had a chance to see
how other children of survivors lived, and how that -- it turned out, sort of to
compare to your own? Okay, let’s get to your wife, then.
A: Yes, well --
Q: You’ve pointed at your ring, your wedding ring.

she would be attending Hamilton College that coming fall. And I was at Hamilton
at the time, and my brother said, wow, maybe Harry should meet her. So he called
me and said, I saw this girl, and I saw that she was talking to such and such people
and I’m going to try to find out who she 1s. And when I came back at the end of my
junior year from college, my brother had me introduced to Cheryl. And then, of
course, we started dating and met her family and I found as follows. Cheryl’s father
grew up in a suburb just west, just outside of Lédz in Poland, a little town called
Aleksandrow. His parents owned a sock factory, a very small one, but they

manufactured socks, and he came from a very, very large Hassidic family. The
family was very different from my mother’s family, but basically his family was not
atypical in any way. During the war his family was broken up very, very rapidly,
and he, being almost exactly the same age as my mother, it was a very, very young,
but obvi -- what turned out to be very resilient little guy. Ver -- must have had
tremendous inner strengths because unlike my mother, he was separated at the most
early stages of the war from all of his siblings and relatives. My mother, fortunately,
went through all of the war with her two older sisters, and most of the war with their
father, before he was lost in Auschwitz. So Cheryl’s -- Cheryl’s father lost all of
his family. One of his brothers apparently is -- so we hear, maybe an apocryphal
story, may not, starved himself to death for lack of kosher food, when he -- when he
reached the death camp. Whether this 1s so or not, I don’t know. Other -- other ru --
unverifiable rumors are that his parents were gassed in the experimental gas trucks,
the carbon monoxide poisoning trucks, earlier on, during the Holocaust. But with
such a large family, it’s hard to say who went where. Th-The bottom line is that
with the exception of his oldest sister, who had moved to then Palestine before the
war, every other member of his family was lost. And this was a huge extended
family. Cheryl -- also I should say, Cheryl’s father was one of the earlier inmates
of Auschwitz. You could tell this by his tattoo. He had a sloppily drawn, scrawled

tattoo across much of his forearm, much closer to the wrist. The -- it was just a
series of numbers with no letters. This denotes a person who entered Auschwitz
earlier on in Auschwitz’s operation. Later in the war, when my mother got there
with her sisters, the numbers were done much more neatly, inside the ar -- I -- I
think the word is the crook or crick of the elbow. And because they had basically
run out of numbers in the first series, they started adding a letter. So right away you
could see that -- that -- that Max, that’s Cheryl’s father, had been at Auschwitz
earlier. Very interesting what a tough little guy this man was. Not only did he
survive from having been in Auschwitz from the earliest days, but he was sent to be
a Slave laborer, all though Germany during much of the war. He worked on
everything from road crews to aircraft factories, to chemical plants. He used to refer
to Igay, you know, I -- meaning I.G. Farben all the time. He worked in one of their
plants, somewhere in Germany, I don’t know exactly which one, but he was
shunted from one facility to another as a slave laborer. Of course, he was lucky
enough at the end of all these trials and tribulations to be sent back to Auschwitz
for a little vacation. He ris -- he was sent to Auschwitz for the second time at
approximately the same time that my mother was arriving there for the first time.
And, of course, bo -- it’s obvious he had to survive, because he gave birth to my
wife. But both he and my mother, separately, survived the death marches after the

evacuation of Auschwitz in January and then February and then March of 1945.
But this Max, Cheryl’s father, went through many, many, many, many hardships.
He was a very, very small man physically, meaning in stature. And he credits other
Jews who looked kindly upon him as sort of the little guy, to make him into a
mascot and take him under their wing, to protect him, as time went on. I think he
perhaps gave them too much credit and he should have complimented himself more
on his amazing tenacity. He died, unfortunately, of lung cancer, in 1981, about a
year -- a year after we got married -- meaning Cheryl and I got married. But I was
able to share during the four or five years that I knew him, much of his background
with him. And as Cheryl’s older sister 1s also tremendously interested in their --
their father’s background and history, as was Cheryl. So between each of the two
daughters, they really know quite a bit a-about his history. He -- after the war, he
moved to Frankfurt in Germany just as my mother moved to Berlin with her
sister Krysia. My mother’s sister Hania, by the way, moved to Munich. Anyway,
Max, in Frankfurt met a very, very nice person of Polish descent, meaning non-
Jewish Polish descent, and this is my mother-in-law. They -- they fell in love, and
she converted to Judaism in Frankfurt, they were still dating for years, and filed
their separate papers, one as -- as a refugee, one as an immigrant to come to
America and arrive, I think, within about a year or two of each other, and w-

whereupon they were married, and they raised -- first they lived in -- in a --
basically a Holocaust survivor’s enclave, in the area of 106" to 110" Street and
Broadway. This is where both of their daughters were born, but my wife’s older
sister is five years older. I believe they li -- they lived with the children there for
about six years and subsequently relocated to Riverdale. The chil -- both of their
children attended -- I suppose the loose term is parochial school. What I should say

education.

about my mother’s experiences, ho-how ma -- our parents raised Paul and me. I
suppose we went to synagogue with about the same frequency. My wife had a Bat
Mitzvah, I had a Bar Mitzvah, etcetera, etcetera. Maybe the prayers, the types of
songs that we used were different. Maybe the practices or the outlook of the
synagogues that we attended were different, but by and large I think that our
consciousness of being Jews, and of practicing Judaism, and of having basically a --
a strong Jewish and Holocaust survivor’s identity 1s probably just about the same.

been too young to have served during World War II, cause he was born in
December of 1928. However, he was drafted u-upon his college graduation and
served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. But he was always willing to share

theaters. My mother, as I said, was always willing to share with me as a child a bit
about her background, and not in a way that would horrify or scare her children, but
in a way that was f-factually appropriate for what -- even now when I look back on
it | would say that it was factually appropriate for a child to learn. For example, you
don’t say that people are gasping, they’re choking, and they -- that sort of thing,
you'd say that -- that they died. That’s what you would tell as -- a small child.
Well, that’s the way she would have talked. However, around the years that I got

view strange craving for information on the Holocaust. And -- and this 1s true, I -- I
would, with frequency, stop by the public library branch near my junior high
school, all the way down on 178th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue, quite a bit
out of our neighborhood, to look at Holocaust and World War II history books. For

survivor perhaps I was a little bit more interested in what happened to all of -- of my
mother’s family.
Q: Since we are in the 60’s, let me ask you a follow up question that I meant to ask you
earlier, but I didn’t want to interrupt. Your mother did not like the 60’s very much because
they seemed to pose a threat to the order that she needed very much, and she was worried a
little bit, that you go s -- astray somewhere. Speak a little bit about that from your
perspective.
A: I think that it’s very unusual that you bring that up and the statement you made is quite
correct, even from -- from my viewpoint and I am her son. I think my mother, and actually
all of the Holocaust survivor parents that I know are tremendously patriotic for America,
a-and truly love the opportunities and freedoms that this country afforded them after they
came here and became citizens. I can’t overemphasize that enough. And I think that that
patriotism in many ways, I wouldn’t say blinds, but at least colors or informs the
judgments that my -- or expectations that my mother had for the way society would evolve
in this country. I think that my -- 1-in particular my cousins from Vineland were -- I
wouldn’t think that they were exposed, it -- it’s not that they were exposed to a -- a more
liberal or progressive political point of view. It may be just that they evolved that way, for
whatever reason. But my brother and I are more main line, as -- politically, as far as
children who grew up in our general circumstances or milieu, whereas my cousins David
and Jeanette might perhaps be s-said to be more liberal or more progressive. I think that in
many ways growing up in New York City during a period when there were -- were

desegregation issues, race riots, etcetera, may have influenced the way Paul and I looked
at the development of society. This is not to say that -- that we a-agree with our mother’s
outlook. I will say that I distinctly recall my mother’s reactions to the -- the cultural
changes of the late 60’s, and I often look back on the year of 1968 as a sort of -- I wouldn’t
say a high water mark, cause in my mother’s estimation it was certainly not a -- a high
water mark, but a salient date in the cultural changes of New York, of America and
perhaps of the world. It was in that year, for example, that Martin Luther King and
Robert Kennedy were assassinated. There were riots, there was a school strike here. There
wa -- the Vietnam protests were at their height. The er -- the era of hippy-ness in America
was reaching its height in tandem with the anti- Vietnam war movement. This was a period
of tremendous change in this country, and the same sorts of things happened, you had the
cultural revolution in China, you had the student riots in Paris, I mean, I remember these
very well. We -- you also had the war that had occurred in Israel the year before. There --
there were lots of -- of changes, there was a lot of violence and turmoil in the war, and I --
i-in the world, excuse me, and I’m sure that these things, given my mother’s background,
these -- these changes, it must -- must have in some way influenced her -- how -- how may

Beginning Tape Two, Side A
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Harry Gelb. This is tape number two, side A, and you remember where we’ve been.
A: Right. A moment ago you had asked me about my mother’s outlook on the social
changes during the 1960’s and how that in -- might or might not have impacted
upon Paul and my u-upbringing. And I was just saying that I -- that I look back on
the year of 1968 in -- in many ways as -- as -- as a Sort of a s -- very significant date
i-in -- in cultural and societal history in America, and I know that my mother would
say the same, at least in that regard. My mother was -- and continues to be very
dedicated to social justice, and I think that the -- that -- that she viewed the changes
of the late 1960’s not only as being disrespectful to -- to societal or cultural norms,
but as being disruptive to a -- to a o-ongoing development of justice for all people.
And 1-in many ways I think she’s right, I mean, I don’t agree entirely with her, but
I-I think that she -- she might have failed to take into account that America then,
and now even more So 1s -- 1s -- 1S an 1n-increasingly diverse nation with -- with a
cultural and -- and intellectual forces driving and pulling it in many directions, none
of which can be controlled. And c-come -- coming from the background that she
did, I can see why she might have expectations o-of society that are different from
my own. But I -- I do agree with her 1-insofar as saying that things were radically
and rapidly changing at that period of time.

Q: What’s the difference, where do you differ? Be a little bit -- more about that,
because this -- if you can, just one or two examples, maybe.
A: I think -- I think that in many ways I -- Iam more a-accepting of -- how can I
say? It isn’t people’s viewpoints, my mother’s very willing to hear people’s
viewpoints, but -- but o-of aberrational or -- or eccentric behaviors, and -- and I’m
more tolerant of that. I think -- I -- I didn't used to be this way, I think I was more in
line with -- with my mother’s expectations of -- of a more ordered society, but given
what I do for a living and seeing the tremendous variety of -- of family behaviors,
and the -- the treatment that people visit upon one another and upon their children,
I’ve become much more tolerant and -- and accepting of the variations in those
behaviors. It doesn’t mean I approve of all of them, I just think I’m more willing to
accept them.
Q: And to finish that up and then we should probably move onto your wife and
speak a little bit more about --
A: Of course.
Q: -- how you got your own family. But it would be interesting for me to know,
which of the kind of cultural movements, or political events at that time, in the 60’s
and 70’s were of particular importance to you? Any kind of particular impact?

A: Wait. Outside of my -- my knowledge of the Holocaust, which of course is
something that one -- one couldn’t escape, living with a -- a -- a survivor, whether it
was my mother, who was always ready to talk about things, or with someone who is
more reticent. If you’re asking about the historical developments that I was exposed
to as a child, as a general matter, I would be happy to answer your question. I think
that the desegregation movement of the 1960’s, which was in large part sparked by
educational desegregation decision by the Supreme Court in Brown versus Board
of Ed., in 1954, I believe, just before I was born, but not implemented until the re --
tru -- not implemented it really in fact and in detail until al -- the great society,
Lyndon Johnston administration, really, really affected me strongly as to my sense
of -- of equality, for opportunity for all people. I was highly, highly upset at the -- at
Martin Luther King’s death, much more so than at Robert Kennedy’s death,
which we -- they were both in the same season, I mean, I remember them both well.
I think the reason for this was th-that I, even as a child, and I would have just been
12 years old then, viewed Martin Luther King as -- as a champion of -- well,
obviously he was a champion of civil rights, but I mean a -- a champion of rights
without being a revolutionary. And in a way that was more inclusive and less
divisive than many other people would have been in seeking the same overall goals.
What I think was interesting in my outlook at -- at least wh-when I look back as --

as a sort of revisionist, now, 1s that the desegregation movement of -- of the 60’s, in
-- in particular Martin Luther King’s work, begat a lot of equal opportunity, equal
employment opportunity and other e-equal housing opportunity, equal health
opportunity, equal educational opportunity movements in the 60’s. The
desegregation of schools I agreed with and I still do to this day, wholeheartedly. But
I think that in affirmative action on the job, and in -- and in recruitment for -- for
higher education, I think -- I thought then that it was perhaps a necessary thing, but
I’m coming to think now, after it’s been a good 40 years of such programs, that
perhaps the time has come as a matter of -- of social justice and to be more
inclusive of all other types of peoples who’ve come here in the years since the 60’s
and have re-colored, both literally and figuratively the face of -- of America and
New York in particular, that opportunity be based on merit and achievement, rather
than on a blind consideration of a person’s color or ethnic or religious background.
And I say this even as a person who 1s the child of a survivor who was offered
opportunities when she came here. I think what is different 1s that even children of
survivors -- I shouldn’t say children, even -- even we children of survivors who
have parents who came here, saw that these parents, many of whom came over
without education, without any bul -- physical belongings, without any money.
Literally with just a carry-on bag 1n their hands, and a -- as they say, a hope in their

hearts, were able to educate themselves, make careers, make families and raise
those families and support themselves, while there are many others in America,
who -- nowadays, who one can say have equal opportunity, but it is my view,
independently choose, and willingly in -- choose to not exercise those opportunities
in -- wi-with even one-tenth the drive or ambition that the Holocaust survivors did a
mere 50 years ago. I think that’s a -- a very, very important comparison and in some
ways drives my changing outlook on affirmative action. Because I feel that there are
just so many immigrants who come to America now who are willing to work hard
for themselves, as did our parents, that they all have the equal opportunity to do the
same sorts of things that our parents did for themselves and their families. And I -- I
really don’t feel at this point, that the government should be requiring as a matter of
law, or -- or monetarily subsidizing those who a-are not willing to exercise the
rights and opportunities available to them.

A: Sure.
Q: -- but this is good. No, that was a very powerful statement, too. Let me think.
What was the attr -- so we are moving back to your wife. What was the attraction?
What did you like about her?
A: Oh, just as a person, she -- I mean, physically she was very, very cute, but that --
that of course is -- is at first blush, I’m saying that’s only when you s -- when you
would see her from a distance. But intellectually we found that there were many
areas where we overlapped, 1 -- particularly with our love of classical literature. I
really like the outdoors, and outdoor activities, something with the boy scouts, and
that th-the -- then my great sports hobby of alpine skiing brought to me, and I
continue to this day. Cheryl loved the performing arts, and was always in love with
participating in and viewing the performing arts, dance and theater in particular,
dance even in more particular. But I really have grown to love the performing arts. I
liked them, as many of us do, but through her I -- I gained a unique appreciation o-
of the performing arts in the insider’s perspective, as have our children, by the way.
And it -- through me, I suppose she has gotten to like a bit more, if she didn’t freeze
so much outdoor, many of the o-outdoors things that I brought to our relationship.
Of course, we shared the commonality o-of being Jewish and being the children of
survivors, but we’ve discussed that a -- a bit before. Both -- both of us really do

love -- or I should say did then, and now do love literature, though, and it -- it’s
something that it drives our family to this day.
Q: Did you get involved at all in the Second Generation movement or events there?
Did you feel drawn to that, n -- know about it?
A: We knew about it, and at one point, just after I got out of law school in 1980 or
°81, we attended a -- a survivor -- children of survivor’s conference, it was held
down at NYU. But basically, and I -- I would assume in large part because of -- of
my Uncle Miles’s involvement with Holocaust a -- research, education, memorial
activities, and because a-all of our family are survivors or children thereof, I haven’t
really felt compelled to join in with others. It’s -- it’s just sort of come to us
naturally, and we haven’t had to make any specific moves to get more involved.
Q: Okay, I’d like to have a few facts now. When did you get married, what year?
A: We got married on September seventh of 1980, right here in New York City.
Q: Was it important to you to have children?
A: Yes, it was, I -- I really like working with children a lot, and I’ve been involved
in the scouting movement since I -- I was a little, little boy. However, my wife
really wanted to foster her career first. So we sort of comprised, and our first son

born on December 20" of 1997, and he is currently in pre-school.
Q: You’re always giving me these neat little links. So how about education? How --
how did you want to bring your children up? You in this case both, Cheryl and you,
or the differences. Did you have sort of similar ideas of what the values were, or
what the aspirations you had for your children?
A: Yes, in-indeed, I-I think our greatest hope 1s -- is that our children would grow
up to be both literate and concerned beings. Aside from formal education, which Pll
discuss in a minute, I think a very unique portion of -- of Max’s upbringing,
meaning our older son’s upbringing was the fact that during his formative years,
Cheryl was a senior staff member at New York City ballet. And at that time we
lived directly across the street, literally a 15 second commute from her office in the
New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Max grew up basically as the New
York City Ballet Company mascot. He and I were there every day because my wife
worked evenings and we would go to say hello to her, but not only to her, to all of
her staff members and to the many members of the orchestra, and the dance
company, with whom we became friends over the years. And she was there from
1985 to ’95, and Max was born, as I said, in January of ’89. So he had his first six
years at the ballet, backstage, in the orchestra pit, in the flies, playing hockey in the

back hallways. Hanging out at the dance bar and making believe he was -- he was a
little nutcracker prince with some of the world famous prima ballerinas. It was a
most unusual thing for a child to be exposed to this quantity of the performing arts
on a day to day basis. The funny thing is that nowadays he enjoys going to these
things very much, and is even actually -- last night he said to me, hey Dad, we’ve
gotta go see The Nutcracker. Because that’s -- that’s a performance that he adored
as a child. But he is not willing to perform. He doesn’t feel that he has any talents
either in music or in dance. However, on the other hand, he’s a phenomenal athlete
and he’s discovered in himself talents which I know I never had, and perhaps he
inherited somehow from his Uncle Paul. But my -- my older son is physically
gifted, and he plays league sports 1-1n -- in many different areas and is particularly
good in the hockey sports. And he plays league ice hockey, league roller hockey,
he’s just a -- a phenomenal athlete. And he’s -- he’s very proud of himself and he’ ll
never fail to tell you, I’m -- you know, proud papas tal -- talk this way all the time.
But he -- he’Il remind you of that as well.
Q: What about the formal education? He is --
A: Okay, formal education. When he was in nursery school, I suppose you call it,
pre-K at the Westside Montessori school, it was -- 1t was somewhat apparent to us
that he might be a gifted child, and we had him tested, and were fortunate enough to

find that he’s a superlative gif -- superlatively gifted child. And he was accepted to
a New York City public school program for -- for truly a-advanced children, and
I’m no-not -- I’m n-not saying this in -- in any way to make him sound better than
other children, it’s just a fact that that’s -- that’s the whole definition of -- of the
program he was in, it’s called the Anderson program, and it -- and there are two
programs like it in New York, Anderson program on the west side and Hunter
College high school has its own program which goes all the way down to
kindergarten on the east side. And so Max went to and attended the Anderson
program and he graduated from there after the fifth grade and took an exam to get
into another gifted program for junior high school level, that’s called the Delta
program. And it’s -- it’s -- basically it’s the same kids and others who have joined
them in a slightly larger program that he had gone to grade school with. And he’s
now in the seventh grade. He is getting a -- a regular, although accelerated and
perhaps a bit more in depth junior high school education. He’s doing very, very
well, he -- this particular child, it’s within his personality to be most competitive.
He is -- I think if I had to descri -- use one word to describe my own -- this
particular child, I would say it’s competitive. He has to be a medalist, meaning he
has to get the gold, or the silver or the bronze, and he’s very happy to get any one of
them, although everyone wants the gold, but he’s happy to get them. But no matter

whether it’s in sports, or in school, he has to be a winner, he has to be a medalist.
And that’s the way he does in school, and that’s also the way he does in sports. So I
think it’s very interesting that this child has grown to be so highly competitive in
personality.
Q: The other little guy is about four now?
A: Yes, he’s going to turn four next Thursday.
Q: Is -- is -- is th -- is he different from the first child [indecipherable]
A: He’s very different in personality. He, unfortunately for him was not raised in
New York City ballet, but I don’t think that that changed his personality in any
way, but I just think it’s a significant difference. Joseph is not as comp -- a-as
competitive or driven a child as Max. He has a very sweet and -- and jovial
personality. He’s always smiling and singing little songs to himself. He’s not as --
although he’s coordinated about the same as any other child, average child of his
age group, he’s not as overtly physically active with such -- such unbelievable both
gross and athletic motor skills that -- that his brother has and had even at age four.
This is a child who really -- this one really loves stories and loves being read to, and
loves imagining and loves creating play spaces and games and environments, as you
can see from our living room, it’s -- we’re surrounded her by -- by Legos and -- and
little -- little scenaria o-of villages and construction sites and -- and letters and he

does these things every single day. Actually Max at that age, although interested in
things -- he loved cars, he loved model cars and he loved trains that went around, as
Joe does, but he wasn’t as interested in building these little communities and
environments that you see here, as Joe is, and he’s -- this is the way Joe is, this is
the kind of child he is.
Q: How do they relate to your mother?
A: Oh wonderfully. They relate -- they relate very, very well to her. Th-They -- I-I
can’t say in any way that there’d be anything negative, she’s their grandmother.
She’s very grandmotherly to them, and they’re very grandchildly to her.
Q: Well, let me rephrase this, I didn’t mean how did they relate, I just say, what’s
the relationship between, how do they like each other, do they -- do they talk -- do-
does sh -- does she talk to the oldest one about parts of her past already?
A: She does, but he -- it isn’t something that they talk with any frequency about. He
is quite aware, prob -- in more so and in more detail about my mother’s background
than I was about her background at his age. The reason is that Cheryl and I have
always in -- been believers in -- in being very upfront with Max, we’re much more
open and less protective of him, and -- and eventually of Joseph than my mother
was of me and Paul. My mother was very careful, I’m -- I’m certain, not to
traumatize me or Paul with things that she viewed as inappropriate for a given age.

And a-as -- as you’ve interviewed her, I’m sure you can agree that -- that sh-she
may have said that to you, or you may have read it into what she said, but I-I’m sure
you’d agree with the statement I just made. On the other hand, perhaps to his
detriment, perhaps to his benefit, I don’t know, I have been very, very upfront with
Max, not only about my mother’s background, but about everything that I do at
work, about everything in the world, both the good, a -- things and the horrors of
living in New York. The sufferings of people, crime, death, disease. I -- I -- we
really don’t hide anything from him. That may or may not be good for him in the
long run, I don’t know. I’ve tried to encourage him to be independent. He was the
first of all of his friends to travel on his own through the city. I have entrusted him
since th-the fourth grade, basically, with being on his own and shifting for himself. I
expect him to lead his friends. I -- I’ve always tried to foster in him the ability to
lead not only himself, but his friends. To be responsible for himself and his friends,
to keep a lookout for himself and his friends, to protect them, but to achieve. And
the funny thing is that things 1-in many ways have gone that way, and among his
friends, whether by dint of his upbringing here, or the fact that he 1s among the
older of the children in his age group, or a combination of those factors, he is
looked upon by the other children as a sort of a social hub, a leadership figure. And
perhaps it’s because he’s so involved in sports and the boys follow him in that way.

Perhaps it’s because he actually is very talented in school. That he’s getting
homework help calls all the time, and his guidance is sought as to what 1s expected
of them in school. It’s just that he -- he’s grown up to be a very unusual child in that
regard. The downside of this is that his tolerance for others and his patience with
them sometimes wears a little bit thin. So I think that these might be the sorts of
responsibilities that a 12 or 13 year old boy shouldn’t have thrust upon him. But he
handles it pretty well overall, and -- and -- and his friends love him. He has a whole
crowd of -- of friends that are hanging out here all the time. One, we’ve always tried
to make th-the other kids feel welcome around our house so that they -- they -- they
should always feel they have a place to come, if they want to sleep over, or they
want to hang here, have dinner. Whatever they want, they’re welcome to stay, it’s
fine by me. And it’s alway -- it’s fine by Cheryl, too, it’s -- it’s fine by all of us, but
we -- we always want our children to have their friends welcome.
Q: That seemed to be the same way that your mother handled your friends, if I s --
if I recall.
A: Oh, absolutely, she always encouraged u-us to -- to bring home other -- other --
you know, it’s usually boys that -- but to bring home other children a-and to have
relationships with them. In -- in -- she also encouraged us and my father did as well,

tandem, since it’s a slightly more conservative movement, especially in the 60’s,
than the rest of -- of society at large. It was probably very much in line with her
expectations about the way boys should be reared. And because of that she allowed
and encouraged both me and Paul to continue in scouting. Both of us achieved the
rank of Eagle Scout, and actually to this day I’m involved in boy scouting. I am
now one of the directors of the same group that I was in as a child. And Max was
involved in cub scouting and started in boy scouting, but since the last year in junior
high, I think his interests have changed and his social group has changed, and I’m
certainly not going to force his continuation in scouting upon him. I just think that
this 1s an interest that has sort of fallen out with Max, perhaps for the good, perhaps
not, but I’m certainly would -- I wouldn’t force my children to do anything. So right
now Max is not involved. But that’s okay too, he’s involved in so many other
things, whether it be 1n sports, social affairs, or his Bar Mitzvah studies, that I
don’t even think he has room in his life for the boy scouts. That might be better for
him right now.

relationship, and have you ever been to Germany, Poland or Israel, because it
touches on your mother’s life and on your parent’s life in a lot of ways.
A: That’s o -- I-I can answer that very directly and specifically. Personally, I have
never been to Israel, and I’ve never had the good fortune to have the time to get
there 1-1n a way that I would have liked. However, my wife has been to Israel
several times, in large part because, as I said, her -- her father had an oldest sister
who had -- who had immigrated to Palestine in the 1930’s as part of a -- a-- a
Zionist [indecipherable] movement. And because she had this one aunt there,
Cheryl had gone there throughout her childhood to visit the aunt and uncle and

through Europe. And in the summer of 1984, while Poland was still a Communist
country, we went to visit Poland, to visit the few relatives that Cheryl’s mother still
has there, and also to tour where my mother and where Cheryl’s father had grown
up, and to visit Auschwitz. That’s what we did there for a -- a week. I went with
Cheryl and her sister. None of us had any children in those days. And -- and her mo

venues that I had mentioned.

Q: Your mother loves Polish culture very deeply. Lar -- literature, music and so on.
Did some of that rub up on you on some --
A: Yes, certainly, I -- I think an appreciation for it has. I know 1-1n particular my
mother 1-is most proud o-of -- of Frederick Chopin a-a-and his work, but i -- I love
classical music in general and have always loved Chopin. I just mention that
because I -- I -- I -- I -- among the many, many, many types o-of classical music and
performing arts that my mother enjoys, that is one person from Poland of whom
she is particularly proud. But I -- I do appreciate Polish culture very much. With --
with some degree of frequency we -- we sh -- meaning -- our immediate family here
tried to visit Polish neighborhood, we have hired a -- a nanny for our little Joe, hi-
his daycare provider when he 1s not in preschool, who happens to be from Poland.
And Cheryl’s -- Cheryl’s mother also unfortunately now is suffering from
Alzheimer’s, but we have hired for her a caretaker from Poland. We -- so we -- we
have many Polish influences around us all of the time. It’s -- it’s just -- it’s just part
of the way I -- I grew up, I mean, we -- we enjoy Polish food, Polish music, but I --
I don’t think that we are involved in any way with what -- what are classical Polish
American activities, but rather we have a definite consciousness of the background
o-of three out of our four parents.

Q: Do you feel -- and I’m kind of jumping a little bit now because we have done,
chronologically, everything pretty much, I think, so now I just have a few follow up
questions. Do you feel that children of survivors have a special obligation or a
special role to play, from your perspective?
A: Well I -- I -- I most certainly ascribe to -- to my uncle’s declared intention of --
of educating others about what happened in the Holocaust so that -- so that people
are, for all of the rest of history, aware that such -- such intense and organized evil
could be perpetrated on -- on a -- a discrete population in so short a time. I also ha-
have tried in my professional career, to spend as much of my time as possible,
helping refugees. Since I started at this -- at this agency -- when I say at the
administration for children’s services, then known as HRA, whatever, but it doesn’t
matter, at this same agency, which is the foster care agency for New York City, I
started there in January 1983, I have been the sole attorney assigned to deal with
refugee and immigration issues for children who find themselves in New York City
foster care. This began because in 1983, the city -- this city, New York City
[indecipherable] was a part of the official U.S. government refugee assistance
program that was -- started to resettle people from southeast Asia in the wake of the
Vietnam conflict, and they were taking both families and unaccompanied refugee
minors from refugee camps in southeast Asia and resettling them either in the

community or in various foster care agencies throughout the United States. This --
they were joined shortly thereafter by a large influx of people from the Cuban and
Haitian boatlifts in the very early 1980’s. So already by the mid-1980’s, our
population and our program was -- was largely made up of children from southeast
Asia, from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and also from Haiti or Cuba.

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Harry Gelb. This is tape number one, side B, and we continue with
activities.
A: As I was telling you a -- a moment ago, the city’s refugee program had largely a
southeast Asian and then some Haitian and Cuban children in it. We eventually
placed about 1400 children through federal referrals into that program. However, as
I worked during the 1980’s, it became readily apparent that this being New York
City and all, there were children in the foster care system due to abuse and neglect,
here in New York City, who hailed from other countries. Some of these children
were entitled and continue to be entitled to immigration law relief, and there are

special federal laws that --that assist children who find themselves in the foster care
situation without having parents willing to help them to realize 1-immigration
benefits. So even though the federally funded refugee program has basically petered
out, and out of about the 1400 children, all of them have aged out, meaning have
gone over the age of 21, except for three children who came over when they were
very, very small, we now have hundreds of children that I have been able to
identify, out of the 30,000 children in the foster care system now, who have
immigration law needs that I am able to service. And I have found overall, 1-it --
through my very fortunate participation with all of these children, that refugee
children tend to be very, very driven, very, very self-reliant and very, very
motivated to make something of themselves and to utilize the opportunities that are
offered them by placement in New York City’s foster care system. Basically, in lay
terms one can say they’ve got free room, board and education through their 21*
birthday. As long as they continue to make something of themselves, to attend
school, to get an after-school job, and to basically just grow and become good
human beings, they can stay with us until they’re 21 years old. And 1-1-it’s much to
their credit and much to my constant amazement and joy that these children
continue to flourish despite the fact that many other children in our foster care
system never seem to achieve much in their lives and unfortunately end up many

up in foster care. So it’s -- 1t’s very, very much of a pleasure for me to be involved

A: That’s --
Q: -- what -- what -- what are little hobbies? I mean, I don’t know how you take the
time to do anything, but what do you do for fun?
A: Quite frankly, I -- I do very, very little for -- for fun, myself. I don’t get to see
my friends very often. Most of my activities are involved around providing care for,
or joining in the activities of each of my two children. And it’s becoming
increasingly demanding as little Joseph, now being a-age four, is starting to have a
broader circle of friends and different interests and activities. I am now challenged
with keeping up with both Max’s activities, whether that is his ice hockey or his
soccer or his swimming or his basketball, and Joe’s new circle of friends and
activities. Is -- it’s -- 1t’s always -- always a challenge, always fun.
Q: Wh-What about their Jewish education? Is there anything particular?
A: Absolutely. Max has, I believe since either the first or second grade, been
attending Hebrew school, and Joseph, who is in his last year of pre-school now,

synagogue and Max is currently studying for his Bar Mitzvah which 1s going to be
in February of the year 2002.
Q: Any particular holidays that you especially like, or any family rituals that happen
for some reason?
A: If you’re speaking about Jewish holidays, 1-1-in particular it has always been my
joy and distinct pleasure in celebrating Passover with the Lerman cousins, so to
speak and aunt and uncle in Vineland, New Jersey. This is what we did as children,
we meaning Paul and I. We always went to Vineland for Pesach, always, and it 1-1-
is perhaps my, and I -- I’m sure it is many other children’s favorite holidays, but
celebrating the -- the escape to freedom of the Jewish people from enslavement in
Egypt. But just being with that family at that time of year has always meant
something very special for me, and -- and I know it has for my brother Paul as well.
And we continue to go there every year and I bring my children and my wife down
to spend a Lerman Passover with them, an-and I’m glad to say that they enjoy it as
well.

done? How do you feel about that?
A: I don’t think en-enough can ever be done. I-I-I’m also pleased to see that
museums like the Holocaust Museum in Washington a-are conscious of other
holocausts, such as those suffered by some of the Cambodian survivors that I
worked with in the early 1980’s who -- who ended up being shipped from refugee
camps there to here. I mean, I think that the museum in Washington has a
tremendous consciousness for the sufferings of others that a-are similar to or
parallel to those that befell my mother and her family and my wife’s father and his
family. And it’s a -- a very important thing to all of us in our family that there be
Holocaust education and Holocaust awareness inculcated throughout the American
educational system at all levels, fr-from grade school on.
Q: In gen -- sort of general terms, or particular, whatever, what do you feel has been
the impact of the Holocaust on your mother and on you, as the son, as this -- the
next generation?

December 13, 2001
A: I’m sure, to use the lay word baggage, that my -- that my mother and every
Holocaust survivor carries with them baggage, some of which they -- this
psychological baggage, th -- damage, or benefits, whatever, that some of them may
recognize and -- and others don’t even recognize it, it -- that will always be in their
subconscious. But I think my mother has made a distinct effort to -- as many others
have, to rise above her experiences, to evaluate them, to see what -- what good she
can identify in her experiences and what evil she can identify 1-1-in her experiences.
To identify the moral values of -- of what she -- what she learned through those
experiences, and through seeing the loss of her family and the rebirth of an entire
generation, and now s-succeeding generations o-of -- of Jews in the post-Holocaust
world. I know my mother states all of the time, just straight out, that people
shouldn’t allow even the most negative events in their life, to drag them down. But
on the other hand, I -- I -- I’m sure she recognized that one cannot but have that
happen, even if you make every conscious effort to prevent it from being so. Yet, a

an objective -- as objective as possible, historical eye. And not to become too
emotionally distraught when either e-evaluating or we -- those experiences, or
relating them to others. And I -- I think that her sisters share with her those goals

about overcoming their experience and -- and have -- all three of them, I think, have
tried to pass that on to the -- to my cousins, so to speak, to their children.
Q: What about you? I mean, I know it’s not an easy question, but if you kind of,
you know, thought about it for a minute, what do you think the impact of the
Holocaust was on you, however directly or indirectly?
A: I think that in many ways, I mean, directly, and I -- I suppose it’s easy to say that
-- that it -- it -- it awakened a degree of social consciousness 1n me. But I think o-o-
other people are motivated by other things and arrive at -- at the same place where I
find myself, but perhaps -- for me this is -- this is what -- what does it. I think it
uncanny that I met and then married someone who 1s the -- like me, a -- a -- a child
of -- of survivors. Yeah, I don’t know whether that is good or bad, I think it’s a very
unique bond. I -- I found in my office, and now I’m -- I’m a supervisor in -- in -- in
our Bronx office, and through conversation after being there a year, I found out that
one of my co-workers, who is significantly younger than me 1s also the child of a
survivor who was a hidden child. And he was hidden as a very, very -- he’s even
younger -- he was born sometime in the 1930’s and waited a while to have children
after coming here and marrying, so this co-worker of mine 1-1s significantly
younger. And yet, I know that -- that she and I feel an -- an -- sort of there’s an
unusual kinship or bond there, even though his -- his, meaning her father’s

experience, wartime experiences, and my mother’s were -- were quite dissimilar.
But 1-1-1t’s an unusual bond. I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic
experiences in their family histories probably feel a similar bond as well, but this is
what our family feels, and this is what Laura’s family feels. And I’m sure that --
you know, and my wife and her sister and all of my cousins, we all feel the same.
It’s just an unusual way to identify -- I think that there are many Jews who identify
as being Jews in large part due to the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust
somehow awakening a Jewish identity in them. I suppose religious motivation
comes from many different things in one’s upbringing. So in mine, obviously, it
must come in large part due to the fact that my mother herself 1s a survivor. Never --
nevertheless, 1-it ca -- her experiences cannot but have a-affected my outlook on the
world, on religion, on my social values and morals, and by the way I raise my
family. And the fact that my wife is also a survivor’s child will only magnify the
impact -- or whatever impact it does have on our children.
Q: I think I probably would have a couple of more questions, but at this point I
think this was a pretty good ending, I think. Do you feel that something important
has not been addressed? I mean, take a second to just think if there’s something that
you want to say, or something that I should have asked and didn’t, that was kind of
important to your life.

A: I don’t think there’s any particular thing that you -- you haven’t asked about my
background, or about my wife’s background. I think it is important, however, that
Holocaust information be memorialized in the coming years as the generation of
survivors grows older and older, they obviously are going to pass away. And
without them there is going to be no true firsthand source of evidence and of fact
about what happened. And the Holocaust deniers and the present persecutors of
Jews, and bigots and hate-mongers will only find fuel for -- for their intolerance
should there not be amassed the -- the proper history and documentation of the
Jewish people during the Holocaust years. So my overall wish would be that all of
us, both the current living survivors and their descendants try now to somehow
memorialize and record these historical facts so that subsequent generations can
benefit from a true rendition of what happened during the 1930’s and 40’s.

culture that they -- they should be documented and interpreted. I think that what’s
going on today as we speak, in -- in the -- a-as Bush calls it, the war against terror,
but 1-1t -- 1t’s basically a -- a war against terrorists who hate America and hate Jews,
is very much involved in -- in interpretation of facts of the Holocaust and how the
state of Israel came into being as a result of the persecution of the Jews during the

the Jewish settlement of the land of Palestine. These are very important things and
have affected the Islamic world’s view o-of Jews and America in the years since

terms of isga -- Afghanistan and war against terrorism?
A: Well obviously, I-I -- I have absolutely no tolerance for terrorists of any kind.

convince people to believe in any particular area of thought. However, because so
much o-o-of this current terror campaign 1s involved in a hatred of America and of

myself, I quite frankly, based on their religious beliefs, and the -- and their culture,

the existence of the state of Israel. They -- they -- I -- I think that much of their
hatred is tantamount -- although it 1s worded differently than Hitler’s hatred of the
Jews, I think it’s tantamount to Hitler’s hatred of the Jews. And although the -- the
current terrorists will never be able to perpetrate the mass execution o-of Jews, as --
as Hitler and the Nazis were, I still think that were that to be a thing within their
grasp, many of these people would not hesitate to do that. I -- even -- even among
