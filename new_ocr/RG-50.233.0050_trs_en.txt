INTERVIEW WITH EUGENIA GRUDZINSKA hE--E O. 2.23, COEV
July 13, 1991
(Szczecin, Poland)

My name is Eugenia Grudzinska. I was born in Riga on December |

23, 1912. My mother was Polish. My father was a Russian, an
officer in the Czar's army. He later left the service and,
because he was a business school graduate, he worked as an
accountant. My maiden name is Yevkieyev. It is difficult to
pronounce because it is Russian. I was first married in 1937, to
a Polish officer, Lieutenant Adam Wisniewski, who was killed in
Katyn. We lived twelve kilometers from the Soviet border. When
on September 17 Soviet troops crossed the border at three o'clock
in the morning, by five o'clock in the morning my husband had
been arrested as an officer. I stayed at home. The next day
they brought my husband home to get his coat. I was not home at
that time. I went to the Russian headquarters, because I knew
they had brought him to the house, and asked to see him. They
told me he was not there. The third or fourth time that I was

| there, an elderly man went out after me. I didn't know their
ranks and what rank he was, and he told me. I was twenty four at the
time, he said "Child, you make a life for yourself and do not
wait for him, because he will never again come back." That was
all he said, but he told me not to come anymore unless I wanted
to be arrested. That was a tiny town, half of it were Jews and
the other half were Tartars. The Tartars helped us escape from
there. There were only five officers' families, and six families
of non-commissioned officers. The Tartars took care of us and
helped us escape. The town was called Kleck. It was twelve
kilometers from the Soviet border, twenty kilometers past
Nieswies. Nieswies was a beautiful little town. Minckiewicz
mentions it in his writings. After escaping from Kleck, I came
to Zambrow, where I had been raised for the most part. Because
my mother and I had left Russia in 1921, my father was not
allowed to leave because he was a Soviet, a Russian, citizen, and
my mother and I went to Poland for a year, thinking that after a
year communism would be over in Russia and we could go back
there, because we had a house and some property there. But we
never came back and we never saw father again. Mother lived in
Zambrow with us four children, whom she raised with the help of
my grandparents. I had two sisters and one brother. The Tartars
took me almost to my mother's door from Kleck. I came back at
four in the afternoon. At three o'clock that night, someone
knocked at the window and said "Pani Yevkieyev, your daughter
must run away.” The Soviets were already there. They had
already found out from the NKVD that an officer's wife had
returned and they would come arrest me in the morning. So at
three in the morning I put my ski clothes back on, put my

backpack on, and escaped on foot thirty kilometers through the
forest to Ostrow Mazowiecka. I had to cross the Soviet-German

border, but it was not watched that closely, there were guides

there. It took me two days to get there because I needed a guide
to take me across the border. So those thirty kilometers were
split up into two days. I stopped ina village. I knew the
local villages, and it was not hard for me to get to Ostrow
Mazowiecka. My elder sister lived there. Later I went to
Warsaw, where my other sister lived. I lived with her. As an
officer's wife, I immediately was aware that an organization was
at work... I met a friend of my husband's on the street. He ran
up to me and told me his new surname that was on his Kennkarte.
That was Captain Woyniak, while the name on the card was

| Malinowski. He let me know right away not use his real name. I
became involved in the organization through this Captain
Woyniak. In the organization, you knew two or three people, no
more. It was a system of threes. But I did know Pani
Knolkownacka, General Knolkownacki's wife, from Poznan. She was
the soul of the organization that I belonged to, which was a
division of the ZWZ. I do not even know who exactly was in
charge there. Some major swore me in. That was 1941. So I was
working for them for more than a year before I took the oath.
They had to be certain of people, after all. JI was a courier. I
carried various things given to me at my rendezvous. [I had two
rendezvous: one was on Sniadeckich Street, at a tailor's.
Downstairs at the tailor’s there were German offices. So when I
came down with the things, I just had to walk past those offices,
where there were guards and so on; my legs always shook then and I
was always afraid of that. The other rendezvous was at a
different tailor’s, at Pani Dmochowskie. You remember Pani
Dmochowska. Pani Dmochowska lived here in Szczecin. And these
were the two people from the organization that I knew well. I
also knew a commander, a student named Marysia Lasocka. I was
sworn in by the major and her. Later it turned out that her
sister and she were Jewish, and they were arrested along with the
rest of us. They arrested fifty-three of us women onn the .
nineteenth of January, 1942. It was night, and it was twenty
degrees below (zero). They drove up to my house at two o'clock. Poles
did not have cars. Private cars were not even allowed, so any car
driving at night was known to be the Gestapo. That night, my
brother-in-law came from Ostrow Mazowiecka. He knew that I
worked for the organization. He never asked me about it, but he
knew. Also, one was not allowed to have a radio, but I would
tell him news and information that had to come from the radio.
Suddenly we heard a car coming. I said to him "I wonder where it
will stop.” It passed my house and stopped at the corner. About
five minutes later, we heard them banging on the door of the
building. I was on the third floor. The building had four
floors. We heard the superintendent go down and open the door.
They were coming up the stairs, German voices. They stopped in
front of our door. When they knocked, I was literally at the
door in a second, and I opened it, because I was afraid that they
would shoot. Six of them came in. Four were in civilian clothes
and two were in military uniforms, Gestapo. They began searching
the apartment, they told my brother-in-law to put his hands up.

It was a small apartment, two rooms and a kitchen, because [I
lived with my sister . My sister was not there. They saw that my
brother-in-law was not on the list and they left him. They were
taking people from a list. When they were checking their list, I
realized that it was all people from my organization, because I
saw the name of a Professor Zygler [ph - 104], a botanist.
Sometimes there would be secret study groups of high school
students at my home. That professor was from the organization
| and he held those underground classes in my apartment. Two or
three days earlier, he had brought me a hundred copies of the |
curriculum for schooling for 1941-1942 from London, with the seal
of the London government on it. I had put them behind the door.
I had a little shelf covered by a cloth, and I had put those
hundred copies there. When the German opened the door and stood
in the doorway, he covered up the shelf, and they did not find
the curricula . Those stayed behind. My friend, whom they came
for the same night, was patching up a map of all of the meeting
places of our organizations. She was patching it with some cloth
| because it had been torn. She put it between a blanket and a
bedspread on her bed. When they lifted up the blanket, they
lifted the bedspread with it, so they did not find that map
either. Wonderful accidents. They took the whole family there,
two sons, her, her husband. Only she and her sons came back.
Her husband did not come back. There were fifty-three women
arrested in our organization and forty-nine came back. There
were two hundred and seventy men arrested that night and not a
single one came back. Almost all of them were shot as hostages.
Some were taken to Auschwitz, the stronger ones, and they worked
there for some time, but they had death sentences and they were
executed there, in Auschwitz. Many people from our organization
died in Auschwitz. It turned out later that a person who had our
list betrayed us. His name was Adam Smuga. He was a lawyer,
thirty years old, an only child. He was a very wealthy person,
but he allowed himself to be bought. He did not live long,
however. The Germans would refer(?) him, so they did not protect
him at all after they got what the wanted. And we had contacts
with the outside world. The so-called "grypsy," secret messages
and letters in the prison, went out through our commanders in
Pawiak, and we let our people outside know. . . He was arrested
along with the other men and then released. They told the men in
the prison he had been executed, that they took him to Szucha
Boulevard and shot him. I was interrogated three times on Szucha
Boulevard. Adam Smuga was shot by the underground organization,
which sentenced him for treason. They checked very carefully, and
they found out. I was in Pawiak for five months. On May 30, the
| Germans organized a transport to Ravensbruck. It was called a ;
Sonderntransport. There were on 3 hundred and twenty (?) of us and
more were added in Lublin, so together there were a hundred and
fifty. And on May 30, 1942, they brought us to Ravensbruck,
where I was given the number 11,332 . Elf tausend drei hundert
) zwei und dreisig. I did not know German, but I had to learn it,
because I had to identify myself as "haftling elf tausend drei

hundert zwei und dreisig . "I was in Ravensbruck until November
1943 . My work detail there was called "Ausen." They took us out.
to work, to the fields . We gathered potatoes, carrots,
rutabagas, pori [ ph - 160]. It was good work in one respect as we
always brought something back to the camp with us. We learned to
hide it so that it would not be found when the auz jerka [ph -
16 2]. The searches were somewhat haphazard, anyway. We were in
columns of thirty or forty people, and there were always an
auz jerka, an SS-man, and a dog. An SS-man with a pistol, a dog,
and an auz jerka (?) . The auz jerka was the guard that watched
over us. I was then taken to a factory for airplane parts and
ammunition, Neu-Brandenburg. There were 6,000 of us there, in
Neu-Brandenburg . 3,000 worked during the day and 3, 000 at night.
The next week, those who had been working nights worked days and
vice versa. I stayed there until the end. There was at least a
dozen different nationalities in Ravensbruck and Neu-Brandenburg.
| I am sure that every school-book has that information. There
were German women, because they were imprisoned too. For
example, I met a general's wife in Ravensbruck who was there for
buying bacon fat illegally. She got three months. Her husband
was at the front . So they treated their own that way also. I
was in Neu-Brandenburg until the end. On April 28, the camp was
evacuated. The SS-men guarded us one or two more days. They
marched us all in a tight column. All of the concentration camps
were heading £ or Lubeck . We did not know what they wanted to do in
Lubeck, but the camps never got that far. The Soviet front was
moving so quickly that they abandoned us and ran away. They all
had civilian clothing under their uniforms and they left us. I
| walked back to Poland. It took me three weeks and I covered 360
kilometers. There were fifteen of us returning together and we
were all very weakened. Pani Helena Jurgelewicz, the wife of
President Moscicki's aide-de-camp, and herself a veterinarian,
was there with her daughter, Krystyna. Also Marysia Kaleczko
[ph - 194], a young girl, Lirka [ph ~ 194] Zielinska, a young
girl, Iza Marcowna, who had converted to Catholicism. So I was
in Pawiak for five months, not to mention the fact that I was
, interrogated three times on Szucha Boulevard, where one sat ina
box. One could not move because there was an SS-man behind
watching. Often one would sit for twelve or fourteen hours
before the interrogation. I was interrogated three times. But just
life in the cell... the cell was built for ten prisoners. There
were twenty-five of us . We lay down to sleep next to each other
| so that if one of us wanted to turn over, she had to nudge the
woman next to her and they would both turn over at the same time.
There were only three beds, which folded out of the wall. During
the day we had to fold them up, so we could only sit on the
floor . But the nights were the worst. The liquidation of the
ghetto had begun then . The SS-men who watched us - Birkel [ ph
| 211], who was later killed on the street by the resistance,
Friegert [ph - 213], who hanged himself, Wirupp [ph ~ 215], whose
last name I do not know. We called him Wirup (?) or Egg

Watchman because he would cut open eggs in packages looking for
notes hidden inside them. We joked that he was scrupulously
investigating whether Polish chickens lay secret messages or not.
After all, it was ridiculous to think that someone could hide
anything in an egg . At night the SS men drank an enormous
amount. Looking back, I am convinced that they were using
narcotics as well. They were completely unconscious people.
They make us do roll-calls in the middle of the night, count us
all again, take us with their dogs outside as if they were going

, to shoot us, then bring us back . We lived in constant fear there
in Pawiak. They told us that we would be sent to a camp but did ‘
not name the camp. I knew only that they sent people to
Auschwitz. I only found out about Ravensbruck while at Pawiak.
We did not know we would go there. Let me return to what they
would do. They would bring Jews to the outside of our cell,
outside of the women’s prison, and shoot at them. We were on the
first floor, so we could hear the crying groans of those people,
the gnashing of their teeth as they died. While it was
happening, there was a great silence among us . Many of us were
praying, and there was just a great silence. We were afraid to
look out because they put spotlights on the prison just to see
whether we were looking out or not. And then they would shoot.
When they left in the morning to sleep, we would look out. There
was so much blood that a white foam formed on it. A foam just
like... it is not easy for me to say, but blood flowed in
gutters. The dead lay there and the Jewish police would come and
pick them up. There was a Jewish orphanage across from us. We
would see how the Germans came and took the children and the
people taking care of them away. They would shoot them either
against our wall or on the opposite side. They literally did it
so that we could see. They were cruel, sadists. And the

. commandant was Birkel, who was shot by the underground in Warsaw.
That was soon after we left, I think less than a year later.
Getting onto the transport, we thanked God that we were leaving
that hell. We did not know what awaited us: they were
liguidating the ghetto. With my own eyes I saw how they stood an
old Jew under our windows and put a can on his head and shot at
the can. The croaking of those Germans, that laughter... they
finally shot him. Or, for example, they told him to run away.
They took a woman who was in clogs. When she started to run, we
could hear her steps and then her scream. She did not get far,
they shot her. But sometimes they would let them get away.
Once we saw them take two young boys and put them against the
opposite wall. They put empty cans on their heads and fired at
them. The boys were crying very hard. They were twelve or
thirteen. They let those boys run away. They did not shoot
them. It depended on their mood. The Germans were cruel to the
Jews in the ghetto, cruel . As far as the ghetto goes, a
streetcar went through it. The ghetto was in the middle of
Warsaw. The ghetto was in a Jewish neighborhood, but many Aryan
streets were included in it. If one wanted to get to the other

Side of town, one had to ride the street-car through. Two
Germans stood in every street-car. But the Poles would always
find a way... they would even distract the guard. When he looked
the other way, one threw food out. I always took bread along
with some kind of fat. A piece of bacon, a piece of sausage...
whatever there was. It was very hard during the occupation. For
example, I could not eat margarine. I had some kind of allergy.
I always threw that margarine to the ghetto with bread. Often I
would return with the bread and margarine, if I did not get the
chance to throw it out. Some of the Germans watched people, but
some would become bored and then one could throw it. Especially
to the children. Children stood all along the entire street-car
track, begging for help. I belonged to an organization, but I
did not know if there were any contacts with German
organizations. But I know that there were. I know that arms
were brought. I worked in a small cafe, Kruszynka, on
Marszakowska Street. In order to be allowed to serve Germans, a
restaurant had to have a permit. The owner was General
Dugoszewski's sister. She may have been divorced, in any case I
did not know her husband. But she did not try to get that
permit. There was a sign there that said that Germans were not
| admitted. So Germans did not come to our cafe. But many people
did come. Mainly there were lawyers who had escaped from the
Poznan province to the General Government. They had a little
club there. They would come and meet. Doctors would meet there.
I more than once heard them planning how they would send
shipments to the ghetto, mostly food. Later on, the ghetto was
tightly sealed, but for a long time one could enter and exit the
ghetto freely, as long as one had a pass. The owner of the cafe
applied for such a pass, posing as a Jew. She had a Binde, an
armband like the Jews had to wear, with a yellow star. But she
was Polish, not Jewish. She had brown hair, so she could pass
as Jewish. She carried food to the ghetto. This was never
, discussed openly, because one could end up in front of a firing
squad for helping Jews in a second. But a great deal of aid went
to the Jews. I feel that we passed... that as a Pole I passed
the examination; as a person, as a citizen. Especially because I
grew up in a small town, Zambrow, where there were many, many
Jews. The town had 7,000 inhabitants and 3,000 were Jewish. I
had a friend, Maszka Yankec, whose family had a bakery. A
beautiful girl. The whole family was eradicated, sent to
Treblinka. The whole Yankec family died in Treblinka. Two
daughters, two sons, father, mother. Everyone perished. About
help for the Jews: every Pole knew the risks. If he wanted to
help, he had to do it very carefully, because he was endangering
both himself and the person that he was helping. Everyone knew
that if someone was throwing sandwiches, he was throwing them to
a Jewish child, because it was mostly children. Older people
and adults also reached out, but it was mostly children. Of
course, I did not look to whom I was throwing the food. I
just threw, knowing that someone would be nourished. And there
were posters everywhere, proclaiming the death penalty for
helping Jews. And there were cases of whole families being shot
if they were caught sheltering Jews. Sometimes Poles would take

Jews simply to make money. Jews had dollars, nad money. Poorer
people would take Jews in for this reason. There were cases
where the Pole was very honest and did not betray the Jew, and
there were also cases where Poles took the money and informed on
the Jew. People acted differently. But I knew many people who
helped. And truly, no one ever said "A Jew. Why should we help?"
On the contrary. On the contrary. The Germans said from the
beginning they would destroy the Jews and then go after the
Poles. The Poles knew that the Jews' fate would be theirs also.
And they were just as much at risk as the Jews were. There was
no [ph - stynty]. It was just that the Jews had to wear armbands
with Zionist stars on them. All the Jews were labeled. If a Jew
left the ghetto, he usually hid the armband. It was easier to
buy things, to move around. Also, he did not know whom he might
run into, so he was afraid to wear the star. Poles did not have
to wear anything of that sort. No other nationality had to. Only
the Jews.
