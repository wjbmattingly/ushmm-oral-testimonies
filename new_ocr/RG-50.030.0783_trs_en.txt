world, and the life that you had before any of these events, before the war started.
So, I’m going to start at the very beginning. Could you tell me, what was your name
at birth?

January 27, 2015
Q: Congratulations.
A: Thank you.
Q: And where were you born?
A: I was born in Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. This was Hosia(ph) Street three, the
building is still existing there.
Q: Really?
A: This was — yes. Well, it was damaged during the uprising, but still, the structure
is there. So whenever I visit Warsaw, I take a glimpse of that building. And during
the occupation, actually, I didn’t live in that area.
Q: You lived — you were elsewhere?
A: Yes. But a— my parish was a church, holy — holy — the Alexander Church in
Three Crosses Square in Warsaw.
Q: Is that the center of town, or is that a little bit outside the center?
A: I would say it’s close to center, yes, close to center, because the Royal Tr-Track
starts from Wilanow, all the way to the old town in Warsaw, but this is part of that
section that covers that distance. They call it the Royal Track [speaks Polish] This
is in Polish. But Nowy Swiat, the New World, actually started from that square,
Three Crosses Square.

Q: Okay. What kind of a building did you grow up in? Was it a huge apartment
building, or single family —
A: No, it was in an apart — it was about five story building, five story building, yes.
Q: Built when, in the 19 century, or the 20"?
A: This was, I would say, 20" century already there, yes.
Q: Okay. And how modern was it? Did it have electricity, for example?
A: Oh, there were electricity, yes, electricity. We had the bathrooms —
Q: Running water.
A: Running water, yes, yes.
Q: Mm-hm, and plumbing, and all of that. So, it was a modern place.
A: Yes, it was a modern place. Warsaw is a — as it grew, during the time after the
first World War, this was under the Tsarist Russia.
Q: That’s right.
A: But then, when Pilsudski came to power in 1918, Poland regained her
independence, after 123 years of nonexistence, so to speak, of — Poland only
existed only as partitions.
Q: Yes.
A: Poland was divided actually into three segments, and this was Prussian, Russian,
and Austro-Hungary. So actually, Warsaw was part of the Tsarist domain.

Q: So, when Poland became independent again, and the three parts became united,
123 years is still quite a while, because it 1s more than living memory. Several
generations are comprised in that. Had people changed very much? Could you
understand one another — I mean psychologically?
A: Well, there were different, let’s say, frames that the Poles grew, that say,
Germans were very anti-Polish, and Hakatay(ph) was the organization that even
forbade the Polish language to be used at schools.
Q: Okay.
A: Russians were also trying to bring their influence to the point. And then, the
most tolerant part was the au — aus — aus — aus —
Q: Austro-Hungarian?
A: Aust-Austro-Hungarian part. Yeah, so that was was a — a little better for
schooling, secondary schooling and so on. And let’s say Poles from Galicia?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: You know, they were a little different in character than let’s say, Poles that were
slightly Germanized under the ger — the Prussian operation, and the Poles living
under the Russians. So, this process of fusing us together was actually a great, let’s
say, accomplishment of the Catholic church, because they mostly — the Poles were
of Catholic faith, and that was — the church was actually the strongest party that

existed in — in Poland. But then when Pilsudski became the Marshall of Poland —
this was in 1914, and officially Poland regained her independence in the *18, he
was assigned a task of, let’s say, fusing th-the different characters of people that
grew in different segments of the country.
Q: So what were some of the — I mean, just curiosity — you say the Galicianas are
different than those who were — and Galicia was under Austro-Hungarian rule?
A: Yes.
Q: What kind of character did the one have in comparison to the other two, and so
on?
A: Let’s say the — the — let’s say the Germans, Poles, from the German part, from
the Prussian part were, let’s say, a little bit more like Germans, very orderly, let’s
say the work that they accomplished was more thorough than let’s say the group of
Poles in the east, under the Russians. And let’s say the Galicians were also a little
bit closer to — to — to — to German influence. But all together, united by the faith,
you know, we were very quickly re — reburn(ph).
Q: Reborn.
A: Reborn, yes, reborn.
Q: Yeah. And tell me a little bit — so, there are questions that I usually ask people
who were in the eastern territories, that don’t apply here, but I will just bring them

up. And that is, one of the — the issues that I want to find out about is the degree of
modernization. So there I will ask, you know, did anybody have a radio? Did
anybody have a telephone? Did they ha — did — were cars — automobiles common to
see? Well, in the center of Warsaw, I would assume that these things —
A: Yes, the Poland was called — they called Poland at that time — the Warsaw was
the — the — the Paris of the east.
Q: Okay.
A: That was — city was about one point two million people. And there — there was,
let’s see, very large Jewish diaspora in Warsaw. The diaspora was about 400,00, so
every third Warsawian was of — of Hebrew faith. Some of them got more or less
Poland-ized, then the — they were, let’s say, getting with the Poles closer, and the
other ones were dep — Poland was free, as far as the religion is concerned, so they
had their ow-own synagogues, they had their own traditions, and they grew in the
environment that their predecessors are sort of giving them. But —
Q: Did you — mm-hm, go ahead.
A: And Warsaw — Warsaw was specially — some districts of Warsaw were
predominantly Jewish. The most famous synagogue was the synagogue on
Tlomackie Street. Now, if you ever visit Warsaw at that area, was — actually is a

erected just th — one year ago, open up, it’s one of the most beautiful, modern
museum, they spend a lot of money. And I think the — the help came from the good,
old U.S.A., you know, so — and then fa — I think contribution was also made by the
Polish president to build in the area where they have nalewki(ph), and that was that
infamous Umschlagplatz. That’s was the — the Jews were loaded on the trucks, and
taken over to Treblinka. So this was ex-Jewish district.
Q: So, was the Umschlagplatz within the space of the ghetto, or outside of it?
A: Umschlagplatz was on the periphery of ghetto, you know, but it was inside,
inside yes.
Q: It was inside, but at the edge.

A: And the railroad tracks at Stawki, there were, I think five tracks that the trains
were coming in, because there was a — sort of like a 10 — 10,000 — 10,000 a day

Q: So when — when — when Jews were being loaded onto — you’d say trucks, and
then to trains, or how would they be —
A: No, they were — they were — they were walking toward the tra — Umschlagplatz.
There were no trucks actually in the ghetto, no.
Q: Okay.
A: They were streetcars, but they were not used. Normally the cruel police force
were the actually Jewish police, because they were obliged to bring the contingent
of so many Jews for that particular day, that were shipped to Treblinka.
Q: So they would go by foot to the Umschlagplatz?
A: But foot, with — they were normally told that they are going east for some places
that they will be employed and work for the upkeep of their own lives, and so on.

periphery. Did you ever see anything like this, were you able to see it?
A: No, I - let’s see. I had my school located — let’s start from a different point.
There were two ghettos actually. There was small ghetto, south of Wolska Street,
which was main thoroughfare through Warsaw.
Q: Okay.
A: And there was a large ghetto north of it.
Q: Okay.
A: And normally they build a wall around small and large ghettos, so this whole
area was isolated. Along the Wolska Street, between Wronia and Zelazna, this
was a point where two ghettos were —
Q: Connected?
A: — connected, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: And they were also at the place like Zelazna and Chlodna, this was a bridge
that was connecting small ghetto with large ghetto. That bridge you could see in

everything what was going on behind the wall.
Q: So you would see over the wall?
A: Yes.
Q: What were the things that you were seeing?
A: Well, the buildings. The street was divided by the wall, and these houses there,
the — cause ghetto was overpopulated. At that time, some of the houses are already
empty, because that process of sending Jews to the death chambers in Treblinka
was — vacated a lot of space, leaving space in the buildings. So that was neglected.
On top of the wall, actually, the Germans set up machine guns. There were, actually
at that time, some of the people that came from the ukra — Ukraine — Ukrainians

A: No, no, no.
Q: No? So what was his reason for bringing you to these places?

Orthodox. The only thing that was — that I remember was the — a lot of herbs, and

Q: Mm-hm. Let’s — let’s turn a little bit then to your own home, which is, I started
asking about the physical, how it looked physically, and if you could paint a picture
for me.
A: Our — our apartment was, let’s say, within a complex — that was industrial
complex. My father was working for the transportation com — company, and where
he was in the — in this storage, purchasing the tires, different parts for the buses that
were in the workshop, repaired. Our apartment consisted of one large room. There
was a bed, and two bedrooms, and a kitchen.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: You know, for Warsaw that was a nice —
Q: Nice size.
A: Nice size of place. And the next, adjacent building was a large building, built
during the Tsarist times, I think, that they had three different factories. That was a
textile factory, there was some mechanical shop, and the top was some chemical
establishment there. So we didn’t have many neighbors, you say civilians, because
we were part of that industrial complex. My mother was running a little cafeteria,
for one place, and the father was working for the Polska Linia Samochodowa,
which was the transportation company.
Q: Mm-hm. Was it a private company, or state-owned company?

getting closer and closer.
Q: I remember the — I remember Otwock, because there was a diary of a ghetto
policeman from Otwock that was written. A very interesting book —
A: Mm-hm.
Q: — and a very heartrending book, because he was writing about his dilemma being
a policeman. He did not survive the war.

subject we should touch later on, that —

business with the Hungarians, or Romanians and Germans, that was going to the
eastern front, you know, to — for a — for a cover-up I used to be selling cigarettes or
newspapers, something, because we deal — we dealt with the Hungarians and the
other soldiers for schnapps. We could buy some good material for our, let’s say

Q: Okay. So there are many reasons to try and catch it, not only for the person

receiving about 1500 calories, and that was not enough to — to — to die, and not
enough to live normal life.
Q: Yeah.
A: So the Poles were starving, but the poor Jewish guys, they were even worse,
because they were getting about 500 calories a day. So they were destined for death.

Warsaw, because it was very cold, and then ’42 — 42, ’41 — °42, when the
separation of the population was getting to the point that they build the ghetto, and
they separated Aryan population from the Jewish population. And then ’43, the

occupiers, they — they were taking their share. So we could not develop, just like
western Europe developed free, and that momentum that they had could not be,

Q: Well, here’s a question that’s a bit provocative, and I know in advance that it is.
But there is the image, that when the war started, and Germany crossed the border
into Poland with tanks, they were met by cavalry officers on horses and swords.
A: This is — actually, this was a false story. Some of the big cavalry units were
surrounded by the German, let’s say motorized units. And when they locked in, they
tried to escape, but they were not, let’s say, crazy enough to attack with the lances
against the German tanks, no.
Q: Okay. I mean — I-I mean more that Poland was so unprepared that it didn’t have
tanks of its own, that it didn’t have modern military equipment. Is that so, or is that
a falsehood?

France, in case that we get attacked by the Germans. But anyway, going back to
that point that the British paid a visit to Poland, Pery(ph) was the name of the town

When they send this to East Prussia, it went via Warsaw. So the secret service

A: Yeah, so when they came over, the British, Knox and Denniston, I think, they
were two gentlemen, and the Frenchman, Bernard, Colonel Bernard came over,
and they were actually exchanging their accomplishment that field of cryptology,
with the Poles. And they were very surprised when the Poles simply showed them

A: Enigmas to our allies.
Q: I see. Okay, this shows how much you know about — I mean, very few people
know the detail of this — these sorts of events. But when I asked of the Molotov-
Ribbentrop Pact, and did people know about it, I— I need to be more precise. Did
the man on the street know about it, or did the government know about it?
A: I'd say, speaking of government, Polish government, when Poland was attacked,
escaped, with a lot of trained personnel; most of the Polish airmen went through
Romania — Romania was ally of Poland — and most of them escaped through
Hungary and Romania to the west.
Q: Okay.
A: So when the government left Poland, ji— was General Rydz-Smigly, and
Moscicki was the president. Moscicki was actually a — as — a Swiss. He was
educated in Switzerland and so on. But anyway, when they left, the official, legal
Polish government was formed in France. In exile, they — we called it.
Q: Of course.
A: So through that government, and the connections of the Polish underground, and
the government in France, and later on when France was defeated, they moved to
London. And then came picture of President Raczkiewicz, if you know, and then
Sikorski, General Sikorski. He was a premier of the Polish government in exile.

A: We learn the first, when we saw the German airplanes flying over, and the Polish
anti-aircraft artillery opened the full blast, whatever was necessary to protect our
skies, I saw the dogfights of the Polish P-11 fighter planes in the sky. The
Messerschmitts were much faster, and they were metal planes. But the planes that
Poland had, had a very [phone ringing][break]
Q: So you — you saw the Polish planes, yes.
A: The Polish planes. The anti-aircraft — actually, there was a heavy machine gun
position near that Clement’s church, in their garden, you know, they set up near the
church, because you know, the religious Germans would not maybe mount an attack
somewhat close to the church. But this — this post was manned by the — by the
Polish army, and the anti-aircraft was very effective.
Q: Were any of them shot down?
A: I saw, let’s say, smoke trails, three times. One was, I think, Polish airplane, and
then the two Messerschmitts went down. The conflict that lasted from first of
September til sixth of October, the losses that the Germans suffered in the air force
— they say that the Polish air force was grounded and non-existing, on the contrary.
I have a book written by Becker, a German writer, who said that first 16 days, there
was a very effective strength of Polish air force. Pilots were very well trained in

part of the — part of the battle — Battle of Britain.
Q: So, in other words, did they become — did they set up the training for the RAF
pilots, and for Polish pilots over — over Germany?
A: The RAF, yes, that was the — Doening(ph), General Doening(ph), the head of
the RAF. He was very skeptical, because there was a language barrier, and actually,
he finally, when he saw what the damages the Luftwaffe did to the British, he
decided to accept the Polish contingent of air pilots, and there were two squadrons
formed. Three or two, and three or through — three. Kosciuszko Squadron. I even
have a poster that I can later on show you. These pilots — if you saw a movie,
“Battle of Britain,” there were Poles, very brave, and we had the highest score,
beating the Germans on equal basis, you know, because Spitfires and Hurricanes
were equivalent to Messerschmitts. Or Dornier, or whatever they had, the
bombing airplanes, the Heinkels and Dorniers, and all the weapons that Goering
provided for — for the Operation Sea Lion, whatever it was, he wanted to put
Britain on the — on her knees. And the fight was very, let’s say, effective. So the
pilots, the pilots that left Poland, they put their talent to action in England, when
they had better airplanes, but the spirit very strong. The — the British were a little
skeptical, because of the language, and we were not so very obedient. We had our

squadron leader at that time, there was a Canadian by the name of Kent. He was
trying to control the disobedience of Pole, how to attack the Germans, but the
results were rather — very effective. Realize that the Poles in England, with 15
squadrons, four bomber squadrons. We accounted for almost 1000 German planes
shot in the air, th-the dogfights. One thousand, that’s a big —

A: — big score.

A: The 303 was the Kosciuszko Squadron. And why we named the Kosciuszko
Squadron was the story of Kosciuszko heard that we got as a rep — re-reprocity.
See, the Poland regained her independence, thanks to President Wilson. And at that
time Americans wanted to pay the — pay the dues for — for fighting, for
independence of Poland from the Bolsheviks; this is the first World War. And 18

A: So streetcars, even streetcars, you know, they had the platform, front platform on
the streetcar there was nur fur Deutsche, only for Germans. Sometimes when there
were too many, let’s say, attacks on the Germans, or too many of their side weapons
disappeared, because in the crowd, the streetcar, many times, you know, the AK
were cutting their holsters, and stealing their weapons, and so on, and so on. So they

A: — to mediocre salaries. Because this money what the Germans issued had no
purchasing power.
Q: Ah.
A: Like for instance, if you went for the black market to buy food in the country.
The farmers used to accept only the pre-war money, which was silver coins. Silver
coins, you know, the tens ztotys, five zlotys, two zlotys. They were silver. I-I think
at about 60 or 70 percent pure silver. So they knew the metal value, and they were
selling food for this kind of bouillon.
Q: I see. Rather — and rather than the —
A: Than accepting the paper money issued by the Germans, which had no — it was
good for the General na gubernia(ph) to — to — to buy some stuff on the black

A: Yes.
Q: Did your father ever t-tell stories of what he would see at the Ostbahn? What
kind of things he would be translating?
A: When — he often told me about the German trains coming from the eastern front.
He said that he saw some kwerp — corpses. I mean, the people without legs, you
know, frozen noses, ears. But they were running through the tracks that were
separated by some kind of partition, so the civilians wouldn’t see them. But he said
that casualties were coming from the eastern front, yes.
Q: So he could see these things and he talked about them?
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah. And did he work with one particular German if — in — official in particular,

between the — the German bosses and the other workers? Is this where his
translation skills were used, for them to translate orders? Or was it in different
capacities?
A: He was translating because there were many Poles employed that didn’t speak
German. But the work assignments that were, let’s say, by the Germans to direct
certain squads of people to do this kind of work, [indecipherable] repairs, or the —
what they call, the platform repairs, or — or is — cleaning up the stations, you know.
So he was always called in as a interpreter.
Q: And do you think that he might have been involved in underground work?
A: I—I don’t think so. Maybe he was accosted by some people, but I don’t think
that he was — he was aware of that I was doing, toward the end, but I don’t think he
was part of it. He, let’s say, cooperated, if there was some assignment to report, yes.
But I don’t think that he was fully sworn in, an-and — and — and working for the —
for the underground. Let’s say Poles were all members of the underground. We
were all, let’s say, sympathetic to the people that were actually the activists, you
know, and the civilians were cooperating every time there was a situation, a
dangerous situation, so they did help.

notice, that a lot of people on the Aryan side were looking from the gates of their

were throwing people out of the windows. Instead of being burned, you know, they
committed suicide. I saw flames coming out because the Germans actually set fire

This was street — side street, but anyway important, because they tried to clear both
sides of Wolska, so the German traffic would go free, without any side — side
attacks. But what we did over first and second of the uprising day, we build a
barricade and a deep ditch on Karolkowa Street. So the Germans, when they came

waiting, but they hesitating to cross because of the obstacle. Then — this was couple
