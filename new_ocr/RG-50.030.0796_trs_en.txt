A: [indecipherable] my godfather was a — a contrib — a contributor to the

Number one, when you were born in Boston, does that mean you had una — U.S.
citizenship? When you — from — from birth?
A: Up to a point, yes. But I— I would have to research and find out what the Italian

Q: And the second question was a bigger question, and that is, 1t sounds that your
parents never — you — they were — you were never close to them, for different
reasons. Is that true?
A: Tragically, yes.
Q: So who was the biggest influence 1n your young life? Who would you say you —
you were close to, of those who were surrounding you?

A: Girls. Strictly, and almost only. There was untouchable on the part of your
parents, and the only thing touchable on the part of the young children, or young —
youngsters, that you — you were part of the life. Because I don’t remember having
any friends outside of schoolma — mates, of some sort or an-another. I remember for
a short period, I had a budding friendship with the son of a minister.

Q: But I don’t know, it lasted, I’d say three months, six month — si-six mo-month.
For me, it was touching heaven with my hand, for hi-him it was no big deal.
Probably th-thought I was a — a jerk.
Q: Was it because you came from different social classes?
A: Mostly. He had a chau-chauffeur come and pick — pick him — pick him up from
school. He was a —a very brief per-period of high school, where my father went
overboard, and spent the money to send my twin brother and myself to private

Q: Milan, yeah? Uh-huh. So, was — were the finances then reconstituted? You said
he had lost 2,000 dollars during the crash.

who forced you to be drafted, and then you could leave that. How did you come to

lose it? That’s thinking about strategy, about military, about where the war is going.
Not everybody would have had that opinion. They would have just slogged on.

A: I interpreted for the most famous labor union leader in America.

A: Two of them. I — I’Il tell you, once I — I can re-remember. One was a president of
the labor union for the whole shebang, and the other one was the president of labor
union of the auto — automobile workers. The one — the second one is the one that
impressed me. That must have happened in 19 — early 1952. I was interpreting for
an — an Italian bigwig labor union leader. And in all of a sudden hurt me like a 10
ton truck. What in the hell did I think? Economics is the important thing in life. Not
Homer, not Dante, not any number of — economics. And I should — should have
done what I almost did. I should have gone back to — to school, and gotten a degree
in econ — I feel like I — I got a degr-gree anyhow, but it isn’t in writing.
