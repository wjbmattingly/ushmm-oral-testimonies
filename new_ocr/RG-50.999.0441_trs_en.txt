>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
My name is Bill Benson, | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for
joining us. We are in our 14th year of the First Person program. Ow First Person today is Mr. Leon
Merrick, whom we shall meet shortly. This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the
generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First
Person. |'m very pleased to tell you that Mr. Louis Smith is with us today.
[Applause]
Thank you, Louis.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests
serves as a volunteer here at this museum. We will have a First Person program each Wednesday
and Thursday until the middle of August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides
information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Leon Merrick will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the Holocaust
and as a survivor, for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of the program, we'll have an
opportunity for you to ask a few questions of Leon.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Leon is one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction. We begin with this
photograph of Leon Merrick, who was born Leon Kusmirek on January 8, 1926 in Zgierz, Poland.
After the Nazis attacked Poland in September 1939, Zgierz Jews were moved to Lodz, Poland. The

arrow on this map of Poland points to Lodz.

The Lodz ghetto was formed in February 1940. Over 100,000 Jews were forced into less than
two square miles of neglected neighborhoods in the northern end of the city. In the ghetto, Leon
worked for the postal service, delivering letters, milk and ration cards. This photo shows members of
the ghetto postal service. Leon is in the third row, and he is right here, second from the left. So
hopefully you can see where he is based on the arrow.

One of Lodz's main streets passed through the ghetto and was kept open for non-Jewish
commerce. So the Jews who lived in the ghetto had to cross that street on bridges like this one.

In 1944, Leon was taken to a forced labor camp in Kielce, Poland. From there he was
evacuated to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The arrow on this map of major Nazi camps in
Europe points to Buchenwald.

Three months later, Leon was sent to the Flossenburg concentration camp. This arrow on the
map points to Flossenburg. From there he was sent on a death march. Leon was liberated by US
Forces in April 1945. We close our slide presentation with this photo of Leon posing with friends soon
after liberation. Leon is on the far right.

After the war, Leon worked for the US Army in Germany before coming to the United States in
1949. With the $23 that he received upon arrival, he made a new life in Washington, DC. He was
drafted into the US Army during the Korean War. Eventually, Leon opened his own restaurant that he
ran for a quarter century. Given its closeness to the White House, it was a popular place, especially
with the Secret Service who gave him a party when he retired.

Since his retirement in 1993, Leon and his wife Nina have remained in the Washington area.

Leon is a volunteer with the museum's Visitor Services. You will find him here every other Saturday.
He is also active with the Jewish war veterans. In 2011, Leon was one of five survivors liberated by
the US Army asked to lay a memorial wreath at the World War Il Memorial on the DC Mall.

Nina, who fought with the partisans in World War II, continues to work as a Hebrew teacher. |
would like you to know that Nina is here with Leon today, as is their daughter, Marsha. Right here.
[Applause]

Leon and Nina have two daughters. They lost their daughter Mira at age 27 due to a rare liver
disorder, 27 years ago. Mira was an artist. Marsha is an MSW social worker and the mother of Leon
and Nina's two grandchildren. Their granddaughter is a graduate of Drexel University in Philadelphia
with a degree in computer science, now working in the San Francisco area, as well as a degree in
engineering. While in college, she taught English in India. Their grandson also is in the computer
world, and he lives in Israel.

With that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Leon Merrick.
[Applause]

Leon, thank you for joining us and for being so willing to spend an hour with us as our First Person
today. We can't possibly do justice to what you could share with us in an hour, but we'll do the best
that we can. We'll start right off as soon as right now.

You were not quite 14 years of age when Germany attacked Poland in September 1939.
Before we talk about the events once the war began, start first by telling us a little about your family
and your community and yourself in those years before the war.

>> Leon Merrick: OK. | was living in a small city, the city of Lodz. The population was 29,000. 3,000
Jewish families. My father was employed in the textile business. | had a younger brother, three
years younger. My mother was a housewife. So the war broke out September 1, 1939. The
Germans came into our hometown September 7, only seven days later. Right away, in Europe you
start school in September, just like in the United States, like everywhere, but we couldn't go back to
school. My father lost his job. He couldn't go back to the factory.

Not long afterwards, an announcement came out by word of mouth that all of the Jews in the
city had to report to the main market square. So we didn't Know what to do. My parents thought,
Should we take clothes with us, foods with us, are they going to let us come back home? Should we
take my younger brother with us or leave him with our Polish neighbors?

We decided to go as a family to the market square. We walked, we sat down on the
cobblestones, maybe an hour or so, a guy came out, he announced this place is to be Jew-free. He
gave us three days to leave. So we couldn't take any furniture. We took it to our Polish neighbors. It
was the later part of September. We knew that England, France declared war on Germany, and we
thought two big powers, Germany won't last long, we'd be able to come back.

Anyway, we called the neighbors, told them they could have our furniture. Another neighbor
had the horse and the wagon. We packed up belongings, mostly clothes. We didn't take any
furniture. And we went to the city of Lodz.
>> Bill Benson: When you gave the furniture to the Christian neighbor, you thought you'd be back?
>> Leon Merrick: With the understanding, when the war is over, we're going to take it back. Didn't
happen like that.

My mother had the sister in the next city, Lodz, L-o-d-z, about 10, 15 miles away. We walked
alongside the wagon. We walked. Came to the city. We moved in with my aunt. A family of four,
we're a family of four. We slept on the floor for six, seven weeks. While we were there, they
announced they're going to form a ghetto in the city of Lodz.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about the ghetto, a couple questions for you. Were all the
residents of your town, Zgierz, were they all sent to Lodz? Did everybody go?
>> Leon Merrick: No. At that time, they announced that the place has to be Jew-free, everybody
went his own way, wherever they had relatives. Some entered the city of Warsaw. At one time, my
parents were talking about going to the city of Warsaw. My mother had a cousin. There is a tin
factory. Maybe we'll be safe with him. We're lucky we didn't go to Warsaw. We went to the next city,
Lodz.
>> Bill Benson: Did you have family in Lodz?
>> Leon Merrick: My mother's sister. Maybe her cousins, aunts, my father's sister, all living in Lodz.

OK, we went to the ghetto, and then hunger started setting in. Everybody was hungry. The
Jews started organizing as best they could. So they opened factories, and they had a lot of
tradesmen, had shoe factories and tailor factories, we're going to produce material for the Germans,
maybe send in more food or maybe they'll leave us alone. So everybody had to work, and it was
important to work because in a place of employment you got an extra bowl of soup. My father knew,
so he got a job as an orderly in the main hospital.
>> Bill Benson: The hospital in the ghetto?

>> Leon Merrick: In the ghetto. My mother got a job in the orphanage. She got a bowl of soup there.
| notice young people going around with satchels, delivering mail. | said to my parents, Maybe | can
do a job like this. If | wasn't going to school, Jews were not allowed to go to school. My father talked
to somebody, he told him, Write a petition.

He wrote a letter, | have a young son, at that time | was already 16 years old. | was
called to the personnel office. | noticed in the petition that the letter which he wrote a big R initial by
the head of the ghetto. | got a job, so | got extra bowl of soup.
>> Bill Benson: When you first told me you worked for the postal service, | was sort of flabbergasted
there was a postal service in the ghetto, because | wouldn't have thought mail could go in and out.
Tell us what the postal service did and why there was mail.
>> Leon Merrick: OK. Talking about 1940. The first months of 1940. There was a post office, a
working post office. You had a lot of Jews from the city of Lodz where | was born. They went to the
Soviet occupied zone. At that time, if you Know, Germany made a nonaggression pact with the
Germans, and with the Soviet --
>> Bill Benson: They were Allies?
>> Leon Merrick: So we had mail. Then at that time, it's before the Germans overrun France and
Belgium, the Benelux countries. Aside from that, when they formed the ghetto, the Germans picked
the most dilapidated section, rat infested, bedbugs. You had some Jews intermarriaged to non-Jews.
The other partners decided to come into the ghetto too, to be with the spouses. Definitely outside
they sent mail and packages, things like that.
>> Bill Benson: For a while --

>> Leon Merrick: Yeah, and from South America, all these neutral countries. They didn't declare war
on Germany. We had a working post office.
>> Bill Benson: You just told us having a job was so important in terms of getting that extra bowl of
soup. Your brother though was too young to work, right?
>> Leon Merrick: My brother was too young to work, so we had to share with him. You get a little
more, extra bowl of soup, so he got an extra -- but later he got a job too. Later on, he got a job too.
>> Bill Benson: | think you told me that at one point there were almost 160,000 Jews compressed
into this two square mile area with over 90 factories producing goods for the Germans.
>> Leon Merrick: Less than two square miles.
>> Bill Benson: Eventually, | think you said, more than 200,000 would pass through there?
>> Leon Merrick: Once the Germans overrun the countries in Europe, the Benelux countries,
Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, they rounded up the Jews in the center, the Benelux countries, the
center, the Lodz ghetto, it was an assembly point for the time being, until they decided to do away
with the Jews.

They were taking out transport from the ghetto all the time. In 1942, the Germans ordered the
curfew. Nobody could go in. You had to stay. Nobody could go into the houses. The Germans went
from house to house, they blocked off the streets. Everybody had to come to the courtyards, but if
there was no courtyard come to the street, and you stood there. | could see the women putting on
the rouge to look healthy. At that time, they took away 15,000 children from the ghetto, and elderly.
>> Bill Benson: 15,000 children and elderly.

>> Leon Merrick: They took them to an assembly point, but we didn't Know. For the first time | heard
about the gas chambers in 1942. | was working in the post office. | was sitting there, somebody told
the story what he heard. | don't know where, but he said he heard it, they take the people, the
people, they took from the ghetto. Give them a towel, piece of soap, they go to the showers and
instead of water gas is coming out. | didn't think anything about it. | didn't believe it. That's what they
said.

Later, in 1943, they had a Catholic church in the ghetto and it was padlocked. 1943, they
opened the padlocks, the Germans opened the padlocks, they were bringing clothes to the ghetto.
They took the local Jews to sort out the clothes. Sometimes a letter fell out, or ID fell out. We know
those are the ID cards from the people who just left the ghetto. Some clothes were bloodied. The
Germans took the Jews to sort it out, and then the good clothes to send to Germany.
>> Bill Benson: Leon, hunger was so ever present, and you told me that sometimes people would be
able to get a prescription from a doctor within the ghetto for potato peels.
>> Leon Merrick: Yeah. The hunger was so bad, and people lost weight, and they got sick, you
know. They went to the doctor, if you know a friendly doctor, he wrote you prescription for potato
peels, because they had community kitchens. We had, you got the one soup a day. The women
used to find out which kitchen peels the potatoes thick, so they went to the kitchen, you wash them
out, took out the dirt, there wasn't much left.

As a matter of fact, | saw an accident, somebody came out from the kitchen with a pack of
soup, collected for his family, then all of a sudden a boy jumped the women. It was a big tussle.

What happened? The bowl fell, the soup spilled. On the sidewalks. The boy just spreads out, and
licks up the soup, whatever was left, on the sidewalk. Hard to believe, isn't it?
>> Bill Benson: Leon, once the deportations began, in 1943, and of course the Soviets and the
Germans became enemies and the mail service stopped, what was your role primarily after that time
in the postal service?
>> Leon Merrick: Well, we were delivering -- OK, so from the beginning of the ghetto the Germans
requested able-bodied men to work for Germany. | remember young men, we had neighbors, get up
early, 4:00, 5:00 in the morning, they had the German medical commission, and they're looking if
they're healthy, and the Jewish community somehow they paid the families in German scrip money.
They had their own money. So we were delivering that. Then we were delivering notices to report to
the town square. The Germans always demanded people. They had to feed the extermination camp.
You had the camps, whatever it is, so we delivered the notices to report for work, for the assembly
points.
>> Bill Benson: You're now delivering notices?
>> Leon Merrick: Notices. For example, I'll give you an example. It's wintertime, cold outside. |
have a notice to somebody going to European houses, you had the building, go into the hallway, and
| have a certain names and address. | knock on the door, nobody answers. | heard a faint voice from
behind the curtain, because if the door was, now it's a curtain, because the people took out the
wooden door for firewood. There is a curtain there, | hear a faint voice. | put the curtain aside. |
make my way through and the curtain is stuck. | could see icicles falling down. | stick my head in, |

go inside, what do you know -- they're all laying in the beds. No need to get out. They have no jobs.
They're hungry. Nothing to look forward to. And | didn't have good news for them.
>> Bill Benson: Leon, your mother, as you said, got a job in the orphanage. What happened to her
job?
>> Leon Merrick: In 1942 also, my father -- I'm going back. My father worked in the hospital, and the
Germans came and rounded up, took all the patients out. Then they went to the orphanage where
my mother used to work, took all of the children out. So my mother had no job there. We didn't
know. The rumor was going around, they take the sick people to sanatorium or the kids to send to
school. We know now where they took them, they took them all to the gas chamber, killed them all.
>> Bill Benson: You would exist in the Lodz ghetto for about four years.
>> Leon Merrick: Yes, 1944.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the circumstances that led to your removal from the Lodz ghetto and
where you went from there.
>> Leon Merrick: In 1944, my job wasn't essential. At that time, because the ghetto started up with
161,000 people, then they bring in more people, at one time or another, 200,000 people in the ghetto.
Now they were emptying the ghetto. In 1944, the ghetto only had 78,000 people. | got a notice to
report for a transport. 1944, | was 17 years old, and so at that time the Soviets already chased the
Germans back from Stalingrad, the Russians, the Soviets are coming closer to our borders. Maybe

the hospital anymore, my mother didn't get the extra bowl of soup, so maybe my parents talk to other
people, What should we do? They said, Well, the boy is 17 years old. They're not going to kill him.
Maybe they only want him for work.

My mother packed up a rucksack, sweater, extra pants, underwear, extra socks, and | reported
to assembly point. | reported to the assembly point, and | got there, | see people hurting themselves.
They didn't want to go in the transports. They're walking around to wires, puncturing your eardrums.
lf you have no hearing, how can you go to work? Somebody cutting themselves, maybe making a
hernia. How are you going to lift things? You're supposed to go to work.

Anyway, after three, four days, they march us to the train station. | had my rucksack. | put this
in the cattle cars. Closed the trains.
>> Bill Benson: Before you go on, did you get to say goodbye to your parents?
>> Leon Merrick: Sure, when | left the house, | said goodbye. Then my father came to see me one
more time. | was already behind barbed wire. From far away. It was March 1944. Still cold in
Poland. You had a 3/4 pea jacket, high boots, | had earmuffs. That's the last time | have seen him.

Don't even have a picture of my family. | don't. Whatever | remember the last time | saw them
it's printed in my mind. No picture of my mother, my father, my younger brother.
>> Bill Benson: They locked you in the transport?
>> Leon Merrick: Locked me in the transport. After riding several hours, train stopped, opened up,
we came out, guards were waiting there. They told us to climb the tracks. | had this rucksack. | said,
"What about this?"

| never seen it. Whatever | had on me, that's it. They took us to a camp.
>> Bill Benson: You had on you some pictures, right?
>> Leon Merrick: At that time | had everything, pictures, letters, addresses from relatives. My mother
had a sister in France, cousins in Holland. After the war we'd meet. All in my pockets.
>> Bill Benson: Their addresses?
>> Leon Merrick: Everything, sure. So we got to this camp, they didn't give me the rucksack. They
took us to the camp. There were already Jews in the camp. The next morning, they marched us
under guard to work, to the factory nearby. OK? We came in contact with non-Jews over there. We
Jews, we came under guard every day, worked in the factory. When the shift was over, they
marched us back under guard. The non-Jews went back to their home. We know what was going
on. A lot of people were dreading, if you had a nice sweater, socks, extra pants, a guy can bring you
a loaf of bread. | had nothing to trade. They didn't give me rucksack back.
While in this camp, | heard about the Normandy invasion, June 1944. | heard about the
invasion, the Allies invasion of France.
>> Bill Benson: How did you hear about that?
>> Leon Merrick: They came together with the Poles. The non-Jews. They heard on the radio. In
this camp, at that point, it was going back for the Germans, Soviets and the Russians, whatever you
call them, they're coming closer to the camp. The guards come one morning, they said pack up. |

square. The place was swarming with Germans. All kind of uniforms, military men. They came to
the tracks, and they asked, "Who are you people?" We told them, "We're Jews."

"You're Jews? You're here to help us win the war?"

What do we tell them? Keep your mouth shut. Told them nothing.

The next morning, they took us out to the countryside, they gave us picks and shovels, and we
had to dig ditches against advancing Soviet Army. The German engineering, OK, we worked there
for a while. We asked the guards, "What's going to happen when digging ditches is done?" How long
can you dig ditches? The guard shrugged the shoulders. We asked, "Why can't you take us back to
the ghetto we just came from?" They told us the ghetto is being liquidated. This in July.

We finished digging, they took us to another camp in Poland. We worked in the factory
another couple months. The same as the previous factory, making boots for the German army.

Like | mentioned, the war was going back for the Germans. The guards came one day, "Pack
up, on the double, to the train station." They marched us to the train station. We can hear the local
population, they were running "The Russians are coming!" In Polish, of course. We're from Poland;
we understood it. But we'd been under guard.

They locked us up in cattle cars. We didn't know where they were taking us. We just had a
small window with barbed wire. We lift up, once the train stops moving, and they could read German
names. | remember going to Germany. We didn't know exactly where we're going to.
>> Bill Benson: The names of German cities as you were going by?
>> Leon Merrick: Right. We could hear the whistle blowing, people going into factories. Once ina
while the train stopped, because it's war, they had to let others through. You could hear children's

voices, people going to factories, with their lunchboxes. Here I'm 17 years old, locked up in a cattle
car only because I'm a Jew, nothing else.

Anyway, after riding about eight days, the cattle car stopped, opened the door, sun. The sun
hit us in the eyes. My eyes got clear, | took a good look, | can read "Concentration Camp
Buchenwald." | know exactly where | was. | see the Nazi flag flying. After five minutes or he so, the
guards came out, "On the double, line up, column of five." They march us to the main gate, which is

We're in the big hallway, the hallway was this big thing. Everybody undress, put everything on
the table. At that time, | had addresses, pictures of my family. Once | put everything on the table,
whatever | remembered, no pictures, everything on the table, | stood naked, and | told you guys, they
didn't give us clothing. | worked in the factory, the machines, running oil. | developed blisters on my
calves.

happened right away. All of a sudden, I'm naked, tall guy, swastika, black hat, must be a big SS man
in the camp. He points to my thighs. In the best German | could, | told him, | had no change of
clothing, no aprons, | worked in the factory. He stood there, shook his head, walked away.

me a paddle shot, who knows. It's 1944. He just took a look, shook his head, walked away.

downstairs, they must have had 30 guards there, they all had scissors. They shaved our head,
underneath the arms, everywhere. They were inmates like | was, but they already had a job in the
camp. We were the new arrivals.

After this was finished, they led us into another room, and they had the big basin, looks like
disinfecting water, like pool water. We had to submerge. Don't forget my blisters here. | submerged,
it was burning like the devil.

| stood up, | noticed the next room, the door is ajar. | see all the shower heads. I'mina

in the shower head, and another guy comes in, he stood, then a third guy comes in. Now we start
tussling. Everybody wants a better spot. The water starts running, because everybody is burning.
>> Bill Benson: From the disinfectant?
>> Leon Merrick: From the disinfectant. Now the water starts running a little bit, so we're happy,
we're still alive at that point. This was finished, | walked into the next room. There was a guy, he had
a pad, paper, my name, he writes out where | come from, your profession. | said | was a student, 17
years old. He writes it all down. Goes to the third guy in the next room, | guess, gave me a jacket,
plain jacket, not the striped pajama jackets, just plain. Gave me pants. No socks, no underwear.

Go to the third guy, | can see he has wooden clogs. | see one clog is not the same size. |
said, when | got to him, "They're not going to fit."

"| say they fit. Next!"

It's cold, shivering, start snowing. Then when they had enough people in the column, somebody
comes out, a functionary in the camp, not a guard, one of the prisoners too, but he already has a job
in the camps. He says "Forward march," and they led us into a barrack. It was a dark barrack. One
window, one naked light bulb and shelves. At that point, they're looking for volunteers. Two
volunteers to go to the main kitchen and bring soup and bread for the new transfers. That means for
US.

A couple guy volunteers, they're gone 10, 15 minutes, come back with a big kettle of soup and
bread. They gave me a piece of bread, put the piece of bread in my pocket. They gave me a new
bowl, because we didn't bring a bowl. Wooden bowl with a spoon. Gave a bowl of soup. | ate the
soup. | thought I'm going to eat the bread later. By the evening, | put down my hand, somebody
swiped the bread.

[Laughter]

There was no bread. To this day, | don't remember. | had a regular jacket. | got ahold of needle and
thread. Somebody stole it for me. Maybe the people who take care of the barrack. Gave me a
needle and thread, and | sewed up the outside, opened my -- | punched a hole, from now on,
everything goes here. The bread was lost.

| picked a spot on the bunk. It wasn't assigned anything. But at night, | want to go to the
bathroom. We call it the latrine. The latrine is outside. | leave my place | was sleeping, | was laying,
| go outside, | come back, nobody let me back in. They said, "You didn't sleep there." This was my
lesson, my first day, the lesson in the concentration camp. Even in the concentration camp, you have
to be lucky. | think at that point | was lucky for a few days.

>> Bill Benson: Leon, you mentioned that some of the other inmates there had jobs. Tell us about
the reds and the greens.
>> Leon Merrick: OK, all right. Buchenwald was built in 1937, 1937-38. As a matter of fact, when
they had the Kristallnacht, the pogrom against the Jews, most Jews when they rounded them up to
send them to Dachau or Buchenwald. At that time, the greens had the upper hand. The greens --
the Germans administered the camp, the guards outside. The main station were the Germans, the
military, the uniforms. Inside the camp was run by the inmates. Talking about the 1937-38, that's
before the Germans, the European countries were conquered.

So who was in the camps? Jehovah witnesses, German criminals. We had the
designations. The greens were the criminals. After the Nazis came to power, they rounded up the
communists.
>> Bill Benson: It could have been a murderer?
>> Leon Merrick: Right. Had a green label.
>> Bill Benson: He's in charge?
>> Leon Merrick: In charge. The commoners had the red label. All German. That's before they
conquered the territory. Later on, Auschwitz and Austria in 1938, it was the Austrian population, they
were old. The greens run the camp, the criminals. Somehow in 1942, the reds took it over. That
means the red triangles, the commoners.
>> Bill Benson: And then, of course, all the Jews are brought in?
>> Leon Merrick: The Jews came into the camp, that's right.

one of the labor camps. He wasn't from my hometown. He was not in the Lodz ghetto. | met him in
the labor camp. He came from a different city. He became close, more or less. We worked not in
the same machine, but we worked for the same factory. Then the Germans came to round us up, on
the double, to the train station. | went together with him too. We wound up in the same cattle car.

every day outside.
Then we had to leave Buchenwald. We hooked up together again. We went together. The

come out, they're whipping us, "Column of five." We had enough people, a few thousands people,
they marched us to the city of Weimar, near Buchenwald. They had the railroad through there, put us
in open cattle car. Once in cattle car, | couldn't sit down. All of a sudden, the siren starts wailing, you
can see the guard. Then we hear the clear signal, the train starts moving.
By that point, we got shot down -- Allies planes were all over the trains, shooting down.

The guards encouraged this to wave to the attacking planes. Tell them the guards are doing the
shooting. Even at this stage, we don't want to die. Whoever had a jacket, took off the jacket, waved
to the planes. Some people had hats, took it off to wave. The planes came so low, | could see the
pilot inside. But the guards, they had the guns trained on us.

| remember one time --
>> Bill Benson: These planes are strafing the cars that you're in?
>> Leon Merrick: Right there. Before we even start moving the first time | came out from the camp, |
was thinking the train didn't move yet, open cattle car, the planes came from nowhere, jet planes.
Something hit me in my face. | turned to my friend, a fellow walker. We became close. | turned to
him, | said, "Am | bleeding?" He looks at me, "No, you're not bleeding."

| turn around, | see a wooden sign there like crossroad or crossing. | think maybe one of

the splinters hit my face, but not enough to cause bleeding.
>> Bill Benson: Others were killed by the strafing?
>> Leon Merrick: Oh, yeah, they were killed.

The first time the planes start shooting, the guards jumped off the cattle car, open cattle car. In
the horizon, they had cottages. | was running toward the cottages.

more bombs, come back and shoot us up again. After 10, 20 minutes, the guards came back, the

guards noticed what happened to the rucksack, because we left all of the rucksacks, but everybody

breads and crackers. The guards lined us all up, empty your pockets, turn out the pockets. | had
nothing, because --

people were in their 20s, maybe 30s, and they couldn't make it anymore. Or they had one guard, he
walked over the column, if you didn't walk straight, he pulled you out from the column, threw you in
the ditch and you got shot. When he shot a guy, everybody from the column runs over to him, to go
through his pockets. Maybe he's got cigarettes, maybe a crumb of bread, maybe his shoes are better
than yours. Pull up the shoes, pull out the pocket. Until the guard says "Everybody back in!"
Everybody goes back in. Then we might be walking maybe another few minutes, but people are
weak at that stage. They didn't feed us. You can hear shots again. Same old story.

We came to another camp, Flossenburg. Not long, two, three days, it was closed, evacuated
this camp. Put us in open cattle cars. Same story, planes overhead. We learned already, when the
planes are there, pick up a jacket and wave to them.
>> Bill Benson: The Germans wanted you to signal to the --
>> Leon Merrick: The guards, to signal. The guards are with us in the cattle car, they don't want to
get killed.
>> Bill Benson: They thought you were their protection?
>> Leon Merrick: Whatever it is. We waved to them. The last time | remember, once they shot up
the locomotives, so we couldn't walk anymore. They marched us out, "From now on, you're going to
walk." We walked. We walked. It was raining over there. One of my buttons popped. | had a
civilian jacket. | had this thing tied around, we walked. At one point, | thought, OK, towards evening
the guards told us you're going to spend the night here. It was woods. It was fall. A lot of leaves on
the ground. They put leaves towards the ground, lay down to sleep.

In the morning, | hear that whistle, everybody get up. | get up. A couple guys nearby
couldn't get up. The guard told them, "Why don't you wake them up?" The guard comes with the rifle
butt, crushed the skull. "Everybody in the line." So we just walk away. We started walking at that
time. We walked all night long. We heard the hum, it was getting dark. | thought it was thundering.
But the Allies were close by. We didn't know it was thunder. People were walking out. A shot here, a
shot there.

The last night, my knees got buckling up there. My friend, my fellow walker who | met in
Poland, | said maybe | should go rest nearby. He said, "You go, you're going to get shot." He said,
"Why don't you stay in the middle? Don't go to the side. Lean on me." | don't know if i leaned on him
or not.

We walked in the ghetto. Came in the morning to a village. The guards told us, "We're
going to arrest you." They left us in a barn. The night before it was raining. Our clothes were
steaming. | sat down, in a bundle of straw, he sat next to me. All of a sudden, a raw egg. Must have

At that point, we hear shooting. We see the guards in the barn, that tried to pry the door open, they're
looking for something white to put in the muzzle of the rifle to try to get out.

In the meantime, one of the guys in the barn, they go to look in the barn, he says, the Russians
are here. The Russians! Those were American tanks with white cars. We came from Eastern
Europe. At that time, we couldn't tell. Was the star red or white?
