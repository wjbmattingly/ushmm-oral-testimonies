Gail Schwartz: The following is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer
collection interview with Alan Lukens. It is being conducted by Gail Schwartz on June 11, 2013
in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This is track number one. What is your full name?
Alan Wood Lukens: It’s Alan Wood Lukens. The name comes back from steel and iron
companies in Philadelphia. There was an Alan Wood Company and a Lukens Steel Company
and about four generations ago, they kind of merged and a Lukens married a Wood and their first
son Alan Wood was an officer in the Civil War. We have his uniform, as a matter of fact. And
then he was the first. The second Alan Wood Lukens was my uncle and he was killed in the first
war and I was named for him. He and my father and their other brother Lewis, all three went
over in the first war together. They were all three Princeton graduates, two years apart from one
another. And as I say he was a captain killed in action, where they got the Silver Star. And then
my father and uncle were in different outfits, but -- and I was born in 1924.
Q: Your date of birth.
A: February 12". I’ve always been very proud of that. Same initials as Lincoln, A-L. And as a
kid, I was always a very much of a, of a Lincoln worshiper as it were.
Q: Where were you born?
A: I was born in Philadelphia. Chestnut Hill Hospital. My mother, my father was a lawyer after
the first war. My mother a Bryn Mawr graduate and they actually met in London. So —
Q: What were they doing in London?
A: Well I think he was there with his family after the war, trying to go through the various

battlegrounds in France. She was there. Her father was a very well-known architect, Frank Miles
Day, the president of the American Institute of Architects who had built the whole campus at
Colorado, enormous amount of construction at Princeton and Yale. And died in 1918. I never
knew him but we have a letter from Woodrow Wilson to him, asking him to please design a
house in Washington. He died in 1918 so of course I never knew him. But he’s still quite
famous. His picture’s at the Octagon there at, where the architects are in the city.
Q: Let’s s talk a little bit about your family. Did you have any siblings?
A: Yes, I had two sisters. Unfortunately, both have died within the last two years. I was the
oldest. Next one Ann, went to Germantown Friends School and Vassar. Worked for a while in
CIA and then married an Englishman, Stuart Saunders, who was a journalist and they lived in
various places until he retired and they lived in Rhode Island. She died two years ago and he died
last fall. My other sister, Frances Hayes married a colonel in the army and he was the defense
attaché in Burma and then Indonesia. Had a very interesting career. And they ended up living in
Milton, Massachusetts where he died about 30 years ago. And then she lived there, continued.
Has four children. And she just died last summer of cancer. So I’m the only one left in that
generation.
Q: And your education?
A: Well I went to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, where my father had also gone. And
then I went to Princeton in 1942. Princeton had a sped up program where I did the — and many
others — the first half of freshman year, the summer of 42 and the second half in the fall. And
then I volunteered for the army. I had been president of the Princeton ski club, thought I was a
great skier and so I decided to volunteer for the Tenth Mountain ski troops. I went out there in
March of 1943 to Camp Hale Colorado.
Q: Let’s back up a little bit. It’s wonderful what you are talking about. When you were a
teenager growing up in Philadelphia, had you heard of a man named Hitler. Were you aware of
what was happening —

June 11, 2013
A: I was very aware. My father was —
Q: Of what was happening in Europe.
A: Absolutely. I won the Time foreign affairs prize at Episcopal two years ina row. My father
and mother were both Anglophile. They followed everything and no, I and I was in debating
groups and all. No I was very, very aware of it and I will never forget having lunch on a Sunday
when the news came in on the radio of Pearl Harbor. And my father and I both realized that we
would both be involved very soon in war.
Q: Did you speak or understand any German at that time?
A: No, I was taking French in school and Latin. No, I didn’t have any German. I wish I had
later on. I learned some in the army but that was not very —
Q: I’m talking about as a teenager. Did you talk about Germany and Hitler with your parents a
lot?
A: Yes, we did all the time.
Q: All the time.
A: Yeah we were pretty much of an international family. And his — and he immediately almost
too quickly decided he’d get in. He was in the Pennsylvania home guard and then volunteered to
go back in the army as a captain and ended up being overseas for a year and a half in the, well I
forget. It was basically a military government. He studied first at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville before he left and then when he was wounded toward the end of the war in 44 and
came home, and ended up teaching military government at the University of Michigan.

June 11, 2013
Q: Were you and your family aware of what was happening in the mid to late 30s about the Jews,
to the Jews?
A: I think we were probably as much as anybody. On the East coast, particularly Anglophiles as
we were. I don’t know. I can’t remember specifically but certainly we followed the newspapers
and the radio as well as we could. And I’m sure we knew all about what Hitler was doing and
I’m sure we didn’t and very few people did but —
Q: I mean the book burnings and the boycotts and things like that in Germany.
A: I think so. I don’t specifically remember all of that but.
Q: So now you’re a student at Princeton and December seventh.
A: Yes, well that was, that was before. That was when I was a senior at Episcopal.
Q: Right, right. You were still too young.
A: My senior year and knew that we’d get in. But then Princeton had this accelerated program to
try to get us through as much as we could before we went off. But anyhow, I, as I say I was a ski
enthusiast and I decided along with another group, a whole group of Ivy League skiers that we
would volunteer for the Tenth Mountain Division. And so I arrived out there in March of 43, at
Camp Hale, Colorado, a camp that was set up in the Colorado mountains. And an awful place as
it turned out because it — the new barracks built and it was all depending on coal stoves. They
had the railroad line ran right next door and that all depended on coal. And so half the people
were sick most of the time. And then to shape up his whiz kids, called us, they brought in some
tough army types from Hawaii who’d never seen snow but to teach us the old army drill. We
were still allowed to ski on weekends at the nearby place. But it was a very rugged training. And
mountain climbing and rock climbing as well as skiing. And that went on for about eight months.
And then somewhere along in there, there was a kind of an SAT quiz for one person to win and

learn, go to a language school. And I won that and but I didn’t realize that I had until suddenly
some sergeant grabbed me and said get on the train. You’re going east to learn Turkish. So I
didn’t go very far. And I met some other people in the same boat at the University of Nebraska
where we had two weeks of great fun going to the football games. And after that we were
transferred to Indiana. As soon as we got there, we learned that they had canceled all the
language programs and that we would be engineers and that program —
Q: We’re talking about 194 —
A: This is 43, the end of 43.
Q: End of 43.
A: And so at the University of Indiana in Burlington, that lasted all of two months and they
abolished the entire program which was called the ASTP. It was sort of a junior OCS idea.
Army Specialized Training Program. They were abolished everywhere cause they needed as you
said cannon fodder. And so we, every, all of us there in Indiana were assigned to the 20"
armored division at Camp Campbell, Kentucky. So that’s where we arrived in early, early in 44.
Q: So you just turned 20.
A: Yeah.
Q: In early 44. And then you stayed there for how long?
A: Well we stayed there training. I was put in the artillery which I had a little taste of in the first
year at Princeton in the ROTC. And stayed with the 20" armored division and we were very
itchy to get overseas and finally didn’t until the end of the year. And we actually took a ship, at
the beginning of 1945 which landed in France, in Le Havre.
Q: You left from Indiana?

A: We left from Boston.
Q: From Boston?
A: And we did a long ten day trip, zig zagging to avoid submarines. In the convoy.
Q: Do you know the name of your ship? That’s ok.
A: I forget the name. I remember my birthday took place somewhere on there.
Q: On the ship, in February.
A: And we had a big celebration, mostly illegal above with my friends. Anyway then we got off
at Le Havre and we were driven by truck to a small French village outside of Rouen. That was a
lot of fun because I was the only one that spoke French in the whole battery. And made good
friends with the French people there.
Q: What were the numbers of your unit and things like that?
A: I was in the 20" armored division and specifically I was in battery A of the 413" armored
field artillery. They always had these enormous numbers. That was supposed to fool the enemy
by, same as they did in the first war, 80 division and so on. I don’t think they were fooled but,
so that was a lot of fun. I got to know the village. And in 1995 my wife and I went back to the
village and I had written ahead. And it was a wonderful celebration and the lady who had, I had
given cookies to was 12 years old, was now 62 and big matriarch of the village. It was a
wonderful dinner with her husband and everything. The lady who ran the barn where we slept on
the hay was still around. And the little and the when I was there the boulange, the baker whose
first name was Allan, like mine, had grown up and taken the place of his father whom I’d known.
So all those people were there for this celebration in 95. On Easter day so it turned out.
So then anyway, we finally got going.

June 11, 2013
Q: This is February now. We’re back in February —
A: Yeah ok, well February finally we got the word to move up. And we went up through -- the
division moved up through Holland and Belgium. They had already been liberated. We got lots
of cheers from local people. And then suddenly went into Germany where we didn’t get any
cheers and people glared at us naturally.
Q: So you never saw combat?
A: Yes, we did. Not there, we didn’t. As soon as we got into Germany (phone ringing)
No, as soon as we got into Germany we were in combat. It wasn’t as bad as most people had.
We drove quickly. We crossed the Rhine on a pontoon bridge and — and that was, we had quite a
fight there. We headed south quite quickly. We were supposed to be in first army which was in
the northern part of Europe, of Germany. We moved so quickly, we became part of the third
army which was under Patton. And we kept moving. We took Bonn and we headed down to
Frankfurt.
Q: When you were in combat as you said, did you see any dead bodies?
A: Oh yeah.
Q: What was your reaction?
A: Well, I think --
Q: Had you seen dead bodies before?
A: No.
Q: This was your first experience.

June 11, 2013
A: And we saw some. We lost some of our own people. We liberated some camps. One was
some American POWs. That was very exciting. Some, many more with European, with French.
Q: Do you remember the names of any of them?
A: No.
Q: Not now. Ok.
A: I really don’t. I’ve got them somewhere and I have my, actually I kept a diary the whole time.
But anyhow we went along pretty quickly and then the heavy fighting was about the beginning
of April as we got closer to Munich.
At that point we had gone so fast that instead of making us come back to stick with the third
army, they then, we swapped with another division that had gone the other direction and ended
up being in the seventh army, which was the one General Pabst that had come up through
Marseille and all.
So we ended up with that. And our big target was Munich. We were heading south. We were
the only armored division there but there were two infantry divisions, the 42™ and the 45" that
were near us. But and we had some, we were shot at by German 88s. We lost some people right
along the line. Every night they had the famous bed check Charlie which was a German plane
that would come over every night and drop some bombs. And there were some 88s, the big
German cannon that were fired at us.
What we had in our artillery was called an M7. It was a 105 tank mounted on a — or that was the
bottom part was a 105 and then a 105 Howitzer on top of this German tank. It was a very
unwieldly weapon. We had four together in a battery. I was the one that had to do the
trigonometry and the sighting of where these four would aim. So we were most of the time,
somewhat back in artillery. But not but then as things went fast, we many times we were find we
were up right on the front lines and where prisoners were coming out. We took, I took some
prisoners actually along the line.

June 11, 2013
Anyhow this was all happening and we — toward the end of April. And as we got close to — we
didn’t know anything about Dachau at all. All we knew that was we were heading for Munich
and we knew the big SS headquarters north of Munich which later became an American base
was very heavily fortified. And it was really the SS headquarters in Bavaria, the whole area.
So anyway, we were heading along quite well and —
Q: This is on foot.
A: No. We had these tanks, armored vehicles and those of us who were not sitting inside one of
those or driving them, were in things called half-tracks. They had the -- what do you call it —
Q: Treads.
A: Treads. And armor up to about here so they didn’t do any good sitting up. And so we all
went with those. And with the bombing going on or the shelling against us every night we had to
dig foxholes and try to hide. Anyway, to come to that. We suddenly, we were on the right hand
edge of Flike, of the 20 armored division. Most of the division was to our left or east, after the
SS barracks. But all of a sudden we came to the camp of Dachau. We had no idea it was there.
Neither did anybody up through colonel in our line of command. But the people in the camp of
course were listening to BBC and they knew how close we were.
So anyway, all of a sudden we come to this enormous camp, totally surprised all of us where we
saw these watch towers and the whole camp was ringed by a moat and an armed barbed wire
fence. So we got that close. We used our tanks to smash the barbed wire and to make across the
moat. Just at that time there was one tall building which was where the German headquarters
were and they had a white flag out and they thought, we thought that was fine. We’d just go on
in. But then despite the white flag, they had snipers and they started shooting at us and they
actually killed our poor colonel. He was at that point his, I don’t know his jeep had broken down
or something. He was standing up on another jeep and I didn’t know him well but of course that
was a Shock for all of us.

June 11, 2013
Later on in life, way much later, I got to know his son quite well who was a West Point colonel
and who helped me when I, much later, when I was head of the 20" armored division veterans
and we had a reunion at West Point.
But anyhow we —
Q: So what was the reaction of you all when —
A: Well it was terrible. Then when he was shot and they were also shooting other people from
there. Then what we did was get our artillery ready and we shot a blast at this building and that
was the end of that. We — after that there was no more resistance. So then we went on in. Now I
wasn’t one of the actual first ones that went in.
Q: What day was this?
A: This was, the liberation was the 29" of April at six PM, because when I went back later on
several times, I was in a ceremony right at that moment when they —
But I was fortunate to be chosen among the few early the next morning to visit the camp. And I
Q: Where did you stay for that night? Do you remember?
A: We still had to dig our holes in the ground outside somewhere in the camp.
Q: And then the next morning.
A: It had been quite wet and lousy weather. Then suddenly the next day it was amazing cause
the sun came up over the Alps and you could see all the snow there. Reminded us of being in
Colorado. The flat area and then suddenly seeing all of the snowy peaks.
So some of us were allowed to go in, told we could but they didn’t help us very much. So we
just -- I got a ride I guess right to the entrance and at that point they wouldn’t let us in, at some —

June 11, 2013
but then there was a Polish guy in our company, battery that spoke Polish to one of the survivors
who opened the gates for us.
And then we walked around. We counted 37 of these cattle cars full of dead bodies. They were,
these were what the French used to call 40 and eight in the first war. They were made for 40, 40
men or eight horses. But actually they had something like 200 men in these. And the Germans
had the — Nazis — the crazy idea that somehow if they moved all of the prisoners from other
camps, that somehow they could congregate them there in Bavaria. And the world wouldn’t
know what had happened. And the other crazy idea was that they would have a, do a last ditch
stand in, in Bavaria. So that was the reason for sending people on the trains.
There were very, very few that made it. The ones that had gotten in that day were -- managed to
get off. But there were only just a handful really that were still living on those trains. The ones
that were lucky like a couple of my friends that I got to know later were sick enough so they
were put into the infirmary and that’s what saved them. Because the train didn’t come all the
way in. Those cars did finally, most of the, a lot of them stopped a couple of miles away. The
trains were broken down or whatever. And then they got, they had to march in with dogs and
they would sometimes often shoot the ones that couldn’t make it. At least the dogs were
snapping at them. So—
Q: You are 21 years old and you see this, what you saw. Can you describe your thoughts, your
feelings? As you say there’s no preparation, no preparation.
A: I think there were, there were two different things. It’s hard to recollect what I thought but
the first is the combat part, seeing, hiding from shells ourselves. Digging in foxholes every night.
Seeing the wounded and seeing prisoners coming out. That was the nice part, seeing releasing
prisoners. But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the, from Dachau.
Dachau was a totally different thing cause we had no idea what, cause even though Buchenwald
had been released, we didn’t get the news of that. We didn’t really know much about it. It had
been in the Stars and Stripes. Eisenhower had very gallantly I thought forced the local people to
fill in the graves and do that. And even though it was, I’m not sure the dates of Buchenwald,
early April I think. We didn’t know about it. Stars and Stripes didn’t get to us and they
eventually of course did.

June 11, 2013
But so we had the one thing was the whole combat part and the second was Dachau.
So the few of us that were lucky to get — and not lucky, were fortunate I guess to get in there. We
counted these awful 36 cars, rail cars and we were then taken down, toured them and there were I
think 20 some barracks, each originally for 200. Each one had about 2000 in it. They have still
they kept one there as a souvenir and smashed the others. Inside the camp when they knew we
were close, the French particularly led a -- well what would have been a mutiny, headed by a
French captain who later became a general and a friend of mine, he just died. He was the —
General Dapeche, head of the, at that point he was a captain. And what they decided to have a
kind of a mutiny, kill their guards, but then turn the camp over to us. And keep these distraught
prisoners from killing every German in sight.
So they did manage to do this, but at the end -- the German guards were all the worst. They were
called kapos and these were German criminals who were told that in order to avoid jail or
execution they would have to be guards at the camp. And they were really horrible people. And
so at the end, we saw lots of their bodies. We didn’t know where they had been killed by our
troops who were just there the day before or whether they had been probably killed by the
inmates. Anyway by the time we were there, we were led down and saw the crematorium where
it had been decided to go ahead and, by the Polish prisoners doing it, were ordered to keep on
using it because they had to do something with all the bodies from the train. And then the others
who had died.
Q: Well again, as a 21 year old, seeing this, not only the sights but the evil that you were — again
do you have any memories of what went through your mind?
A: I think if you think of some of the prisoners. I mean many I talked to later and became close
friends with, they were men who were originally say 200 pounds were down to about 80 pounds
and they were just skeletons. Our first instinct was to hand out food and candy and we were told
not to because their bodies couldn’t take it and as soon as our officers got in there, we were told
to get out because they didn’t want us to get typhus.
Q: Did any of the prisoners come up and try to talk to you?

https://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 15
June 11, 2013
A: Oh yes, oh my gosh. They came up and hugged us and everything else. At that point we
didn’t have all these restrictions and our doctors hadn’t gotten there to get us out and the other
thing was that we weren’t supposed to be there very long. As soon as we had this little tour, they
said to hurry up. We had to go continue to Munich. So it wasn’t as if our particular divisions
stayed very long. Certainly the 20" armored didn’t.
Q: When they came up to you, how did you respond?
A: Well they came and hugged us. Really and, and I was able to speaking French, to talk with a
lot of them. The French prisoners were a little bit better shape because most of them had only
been there nine months. Some of the Germans had been there since 1933. It was an enormous
mixture of people. To our surprise we learned later that only 16 percent were Jewish. The camp
is, to go back, as you probably know but in, back in 33, it was German Protestants originally.
Various other kinds of anarchists, people that —
Q: Political —
A: Yeah political ones. And then the really enormous increase came after the Russian front. And
that was the worst horrible thing. They had about 4000 Russian prisoners and they still celebrate
it or celebrated that. And they were all told at one point to race down in the field. And if they got
down to the other end, they would be free. And they were all shot in the back. But when we got
there the mélange of people, it was a little hard to make out. But mostly were Eastern European.
And the ones in better shape though were the French, because most of the French had been in the
French resistance and when we came into Normandy, what they tried to do was to turn over their
respective villages to us. And many of them got caught doing it by the Gestapo. They were too
eager. So they were then sent to Dachau. But because of that, they had only been there nine
months compared to the longer periods of most of the others, and particularly the Eastern
Europeans. And they were the ones that had sort of organized this sort of mutiny to turn the
camp over to us.
Q: What were the reactions of the other young men in your —

https://collections.ushmm.org

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 16
June 11, 2013
A: Well I think we all had the same reaction pretty much. The curious thing, there were really
very few from the 20" armored. Just as we were invited into what they called combat command.
And combat command B which we were in, only had our — we were the only artillery part of
that. There was a very small part of our division and that was just by a fluke because the division
was headed south and three quarters of it were after the SS and going straight to Munich. So it
just happened that we were on the right flank. And then at the same time, after we had used our
tanks to open up the barbed wire and all, then you had the, both the 42™ and 45" division that
came in, in strong numbers. And that became a kind of a hassle later on because there were two
colonels, one from each division that each thought that they got there first. And then Marguerite
Higgins who was the first correspondent who came from the Tribune, and she rode in and I think
it was the 45" and they claimed to be the first there. And so did the 42". We got very little credit
for a long time. When I went back in 1940, 95, for the 50", there were only three of us from the
20" armored who sort of hooked on. My great, close Princeton roommate that I went back with
who had been in the same outfit who has since died, he and I and one other guy that turned up,
piggy backed on. The 42" division really ran the reunion. There was a German American who
lived in Munich who did all of the work so we found out about it and hooked on to them.
So we got in to all of that, that way. But they were still arguing about who got there first and who
did what. But I was able then, because I knew the ambassador and the counsel general, to get
them to agree. They had no problem with this, that there would be a plaque for the 20" armored
as well as the other two that already had it. And that took a while to get through and eventually
we put the big plaque up and I actually sort of inaugurated it when I went back in 2010, right at
the gates where it says Arbeit Frei, the main gate.
So that was all a sort of an ancillary part of this but —
Q: Did the officers while you were inside of Dachau, did the come over — the American, your
officers — did they say anything special to you about what you’re looking at, witnessing?
A: No, because they were just as -- I think they were just as shocked as we were. When people
walked around, nobody really cared and if people hugged us they didn’t care whether we were
officers or not and I don’t’ even remember when we walked around, some of us, I don’t’ think

we hardly walked around with any officers that I can remember. We went to this crematortum
and then we kept talking to the prisoners all the way and then we were taken up to the big
building where the SS had had its headquarters. They were all gone. Maybe they had been shot
or they mostly had fled. And that’s where for example, I picked up that Nazi flag that the officer,
and some other souvenirs like that.
But anyway we weren’t, I mean all this took about two hours of running around and then after
that we had to leave. So that was our initial feeling about it, as much as you could have. And
then we went right ahead and —
Q: When you left the camp did you and the other young men talk about it?
A: Oh yeah and I had pictures but I don’t know. I didn’t really keep those. Oh yeah we were all
shocked but then we went on and we thought there’d be a big battle over in Munich. There really
wasn’t. It was declared an open city just before that so we drove right through it and it was very,
mostly a smashed city but there wasn’t any fighting to speak of there. And then we headed
towards Salzburg. And we had some, a couple of big battles there. But then the Germans, several
days before the war end, began to give up and then we had these tremendous lines of prisoners.
Another guy and I were, we sort of fanned out as we went and we ended up taking a bunch of
prisoners. And as we were heading between there and Salzburg, a couple of days before the war
ended, we saw the, all of the Hitler Youth walking toward us from the village where the previous
post was. And I’m sure we passed his Feldhausen or something, his village, cause we saw these
kids and we just made sure they were disarmed and just told them to keep walking. We didn’t
know what do with them. So anyway we drove down and about two days before the end of the
war, we were told to stop briefly and no more firing. But keep taking prisoners. And we did and
then so finally we arrived at Salzburg on May eighth. And it was a different, second armored
division which were -- we were all clothed in American uniforms and everything else, except for
the French thing on the shoulder, converged with us. And that was a lot of fun for me because I
was able to speak and they had liberated a champagne factory and killed a lot of chickens. So we
celebrated V-E day together in Salzburg.

Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 18
June 11, 2013
Q: When you left Dachau and were moving along and you saw Germans, did you have any
feeling of anger towards them after what you had seen?
A: Yeah, we certainly did. I mean at that point we weren’t going to go kill anybody but I mean
we certainly — it was more disgust, yes completely. They would do it and then some of these
poor soldiers, it was quite clear probably later than then that they were sort of poor Hungarians
who had been drafted in this and that kind of a third rate soldiers just thrown into the Wehrmacht
at the end. So I don’t think any of us thought much about it. We just kept taking prisoners and
disarming them. Told them to keep walking, pretty much is what happened.
Then a weird thing happened right after that. Our 20" armored division was told to go after Tito.
This was absolutely crazy because it meant driving over the Alps on a narrow road where over
these tiny bridges where any one bridge could have stopped our whole progress. So we got all
the way up kind of to the divide over Austria, from Austria to Italy, I guess it was, and were told
to stop. So we were way up there. I remember climbing the highest mountain with some friends,
the Dochstein and it was a kind of a little summer resort. So we sat there for about two weeks
and had a great time and then we were told to come back down again so we came back down and
were parked by the Chiemsee a wonderful lake between Munich and Salzburg which later
became a kind of an American rest camp. So we hung around there for quite a while and that
was fun. And then we were spread out to different villages in the occupation and that part we
liked. We were here and there. I was sort of a local burgermeister for a while. We spread to
different villages. Although I didn’t know much German then. But that was interesting. And
that’s when Jack Benny and Ingrid Bergman came out on a USO show and I won a lottery to
have dinner with Ingrid. Pll show you the picture later. That was fun.
Q: What about the refugees that you came in contact with while you were being a burgermeister?
A: Well these weren’t so much, most of the soldiers had gone. The refugees there were some
there, but not so many. These were mostly just Germans that were, a lot of them were soldiers
that we didn’t — or kids that had taken off uniform and come back so there wasn’t really any way
that we could tell what they were. And it was tricky because people were suddenly trying to be
very friendly and this and that and we were all — we had all taken over houses so we could sleep

in real beds. All of that. It was an interesting period. It didn’t last very long because through the
month of June and in, well into July. And then we were told to get ready to come home to go to
the invasion of Japan because we had had such a relatively easy time compared to other
divisions.
So finally we took a train ride across Germany and France. It took about a week to Camp Lucky
Strike which was near Le Havre where they — that was the embarkation point. Sat around there
for a week or two. That was fun. We could swim. We went and met some French people and
then finally they put us on a ship.
Q: What as your reaction when you heard that Hitler was dead?
A: We were all very happy of course. And what is very interesting when I went back each time
on the -- I think it was the 29". I’m not sure of the day. I think it was because that we were there
and it could have been the 30". They ring the bells. They still do it. It’s 3:00 in the afternoon.
And we were in downtown Munich. I think it must have been the 30". Not during the war but
when we were, when we went back.
(someone arrives)
A: So long story short. We got home and we were all given a month off and that happened to be
the month basically the month of August before we had to go to Camp Cook in California, and
reassemble theoretically for Japan. Fortunately the war came to the end when we were home.
My father was then teaching military government and had been evacuated from Europe. He was
a major in Michigan and my mother was there and my two sisters. They had come from Vassar
for the summer.
Q: You were 21, had seen death up close, terrible, terrible things. Did you feel like a very old
person, so much older than when you had started?
A: I guess so. I don’t —

Q: After what you had experienced. And the fighting and the —
A: I don’t think I— I don’t know. I was so glad to get home and I don’t think I philosophized
about that too much. But we had we had to go on to Japan, I think it would have been another
problem. But we didn’t. The ones that you had to have a point system to get out and the ones
that had been there longer had more points. It was really based on the amount of time overseas
and all. So some of us didn’t have very many and they sent us out after we had our month off in
August, went out to Camp Cook California, which is now Vandenberg air base. And just fooled
around, really. There wasn’t anything to do there. But we had to stay in until we had enough
time to get out. So another guy and just spent the fall sort of hitchhiking around, visiting
California, reading a lot, and then finally he and I and another guy sort of hitchhiked our way
back across the country in time to be home for Christmas.
Q: Were you discharged by then?
A: No, we weren’t. I had to go back and we were just fooling around. We were given a big leave
at Christmas time and I still had to go back to California.
Q: When you went back —
A: Yeah, went back for another two months and then got back. And I was finally discharged
actually on my birthday.
Q: In 46?
A: In 46. And went right back to Princeton two weeks later.
Q: How do you go back to Princeton when you walked around Dachau?
A: Well. Well I think that I found that my experience was, at Dachau was a special thing but I
think that many of my class, they had been in the Battle of the Bulge or they had a much tougher

time than I had. A great many had been in the Pacific, but basically the navy had missed most of
the worst part of it. But —
Q: Did you talk about your experience with the other students?
A: Yeah, some people did and some didn’t. I did and I didn’t mind talking about it. Maybe
because it was less brutal than something like the Battle of the Bulge where we were, where we
lost so many people. I mean we didn’t have that experience of losing so many of our comrades.
We did have this Dachau experience, of course. It’s very interesting. Some of my friends never
clammed up and once in a while we’d be in a bull session back at Princeton or many years since
that at a reunion and get somebody to start talking who had never talked before.
But Princeton was very good. They gave us, gave me and some of the others credit sort of for the
first half of sophomore year because of being in Indiana for a while. And so I went back for the
second half of sophomore year. And then finished the two final years junior and senior.
And what we all did was basically everybody that started in 42, became members of the class of
46, even though we didn’t finish til 48.
Q: What did you major in?
A: I was in the Woodrow Wilson school of international affairs.
Q: As an undergrad?
A: Yeah. Well I really was an undergrad and then, although I taught for a couple of years and
then I taught at St. Albans the sixth grade and when I was there I got, finished an MA at
Georgetown and then I studied in Spain and France too later on.
Q: Did you want to study international affairs because you had been in the service?
A: Yeah, I think that’s very much —

Q: Influence you?
A: Oh yeah very much so. Well maybe it was my family upbringing and so on. But no, it really
inspired me. The army, being overseas to get in the foreign service.
Q: You had first-hand experience.
A: Yeah and I wanted to go back and do more of that. I never had any particular — I taught for a
while but I never had any desire to be a lawyer or anything else, except the foreign service. So —
Q: Did you think in those first few years after the war, did you think of your war time experience
as often?
A: I think so because what I did was I scribbled the whole thing. My mother typed up the whole
thing. We still have the whole —
Q: You kept a journal?
A: Yeah and when Suzy and I went over 95, we first went to the French village. She couldn’t,
she was teaching and couldn’t do the part to Dachau which I did with my great friend, Ed Nesbit.
But we did the French part together and she had to get back to teach. So I went there that year
and that’s when I met some of these, mostly the French survivors and got to know them very
well. And I went back in 05, I guess it was. Yeah, with her. I went three times. I went and then
finally in 2010, when I went back I was the only American soldier who’d been there in 45.
Q: Let’s talk about your career. So you finished the Woodrow Wilson school and then you
taught, you said then you taught.
A: Yeah right after that I went over. I spent a year studying in France and Spain. Came back
from there. Looked for something to do. Found a, through Princeton a job in Arizona in a
boarding school teaching French, Spanish, Latin and tennis. Then I did that for a year and then I

wanted to be back in Washington. And I wrote to the head master of St. Albans who was a, had
been the chaplain at Episcopal, Charlie Martin. And he wrote back and said yeah you can come
and teach the sixth grade, no questions asked. So I did that for a whole year. I would have stayed
on, very much they wanted me to. I loved that. And worked on the MA. But in the meantime I
got involved in the foreign service and was selected to go to Turkey in the summer of 51. And
got married to Polly in June of 51, just before that. So that started the foreign service career.
Q: So you went to Turkey?
A: Yeah I had two years in Turkey, first as an assistant cultural officer in Ankara for a year and
then cultural officer in Istanbul for the second year. And learned a lot of Turkish. Hoped to stay
on but that was when USIS was established and dissolved. It was very complicated anyway. I
couldn’t stay in Turkey. And came back and they suddenly said they needed a public affairs
officer in Martinique who spoke French so I did that for two years and that was fun. Martinique,
Guadeloupe, French Guinea, and what not. And I came back from there. They put me in the
news division of the State Department. I did that. I accompanied Romanians around the 1956
election. I helped with the evacuation of the Hungarians at Camp Kilmer. I went up to the UN
for a while, various jobs. And then at the end of 56 I guess it was, they wanted somebody who
was bilingual and was on the international staff of NATO in Paris. So I got that job.
And then we were in Paris for two years until — and that was fun. And we did well. The job
wasn’t particularly significant or world shaking but life was nice. And then at the end of that I
suddenly got a call from personnel that the American consul in Brazzaville for all of central
Africa had died of a heart attack. And they said you put down you wanted to go to Africa. So
there you go. So I did. So we went down at the beginning of 1960.
Q: This is as ambassador?
A: No, no, no. this was just counsel and then eventually counsel general, but I was the only
American for four big countries at that point. Then that was very, very exciting that summer
because that’s when the mutiny took place. I was a member of the delegation to the
independence of the big Congo. And June 30", 1960. Five days later they had the mutiny and

all the people, the missionaries, everybody had to get out and command air force sent down two
planes with helicopters and we spent, ran from my porch. There was no communication except
by, with the other side of the river except by walkie talkie, at that point.
Q: This is you and your family?
A: Yeah we were all there, on the top floor of this old bank which is curiously where I went back
25 years as ambassador and the whole bank building was our office but in those days the office
was downstairs and the top floor was where we lived. Wasn’t very fancy. But that was very
exciting. We had the whole breakup of the main Congo and then my friend, I had to
communicate the request for American assistance which turned out to be UN. All of that took
place that summer.
And then right in the middle of that, this was all in July. In the middle of August, suddenly De
Gaulle decided he would give independence to all of those countries. And so then I ended up
being the US representative to four independences. One every 48 hours in charge of Central
African Republic, Brazzaville, the Congo and Gabon. And there I remained in charge of those
for a while until eventually an ambassador came for the four and State Department said you
don’t want to work under him. You’ve been in charge. Why don’t you pick one of the other
places and be in charge. So I picked Bangui, the Central African Republic. I moved up there at
the end of 1960, got the embassy going there in February, moved up from Brazzaville. And my
mother came down and then left for the, for England on the tenth of May, 61 which is when the
plane went down. Over Algeria.
Q: And who did you lose in the —
A: My mother, the wife and the three kids. They were supposed to have headed to London for
the birth of the fourth because the facilities weren’t, probably would have been good enough but
that’s another story. And we never figured out why. There was just recently some Frenchman
who’s been after me trying to dig up what he thought was some kind of a conspiracy that brought
the plane down. We don’t know. And I wasn’t going to dig all that out. I think, I don’t think, it
wasn’t shot down obviously. It could have been a mechanical thing or it could have, the pilot

might have gone to sleep. We don’t know. But I got a lawyer, an American lawyer friend to look
into it to see the thing, but I finally decided I wasn’t going to have law suits for years. They at
that point they handed out, I think it was eight thousand for, it was very small amount compared
to what they do now but anyhow, I decided, I think wisely, I wanted to get on with my life and
then I met her quite soon after that.
Q: You met your second wife?
A: In Paris.
Q: You went to Paris then?
A: Well yeah they offered me the job at the UN on Africa with Adlai Stevenson which was
tempting or go back to Paris where I had so many friends and I preferred that. So I went back
there. My closest friend there turned out to be our best man later, was there in Paris. And she
was over as a Student. Her brother in law was working in the embassy. And I was then General
Gavin’s personal assistant which was an interesting job. He was Kennedy’s new appointee. And
I was introducing people in a protocol line. When she came through and that’s when I actually
met her.
Q: And your wife’s name is ?
A: Suzy. And —
Q: And her maiden name?
A: Atkinson. And her brother in law, Will Stabler, was in the embassy and we have been very
close to them over the years. The eldest daughter, there were four daughters, was Emily who is
still around here. Her husband, Wells died a couple of years ago. He was ambassador to Spain.
And he actually played golf today with Emily so we see her a lot.

Q: So you stayed in Paris?
A: So we stayed in Paris and that was in—and we got engaged in the summer of 62. When I
came back home she had finished studying French and was home. And got married back in
Greenwich in her house on the 29" of December 62. Went right back to Paris on the France. And
then we were there I guess not that long. Til that summer, when I had the chance to go to a good
job in Morocco so then we went there. And we had two years there. Three children born — a boy
and the two girls. And then back to Washington fairly briefly and then I ran African personnel
and then suddenly a chance to go and be number two in Senegal. So we did that for three years.
And 45 years later is when we went back when our son was there. I had three years as number
two there. And then three years as number two in Nairobi. And then Kissinger mixed everybody
up so I went back suddenly to personnel, did that for about a year. And they suddenly moved me
into being in charge of Spain and Portugal. That was fascinating. It was — and Franco was dead,
dying in Spain and the Portuguese revolution and had a big fight, not personally so much, with
Kissinger but he tried to win the Portuguese revolution himself without any — and I ended up and
my friend ambassador Carlucci saying that the way was -- the socialists were the hope of there,
not the old line right wingers. Anyway to make a long story short , that annoyed Kissinger. That
and other things and he decided that Portugal and Spain shouldn’t be under France so he abruptly
moved that section of the State Department under northern Europe. My boss the assistant
secretary told me that one day and said I’m sorry you haven’t got a job because it’s been
abolished but I need somebody good and to be number two in Copenhagen. So we did that for
three years. And that was fun.
And at the end of that again there was sort of a hiatus but then they said we need a good guy to
be counsel general in Cape Town. So we had three fascinating years down there. Came back for
two years when I was in charge of western Europe for intelligence and research. And at the end
of that made me ambassador to Congo. Did that for three years until we retired in 87.
Q: From 84 to 87 you were the ambassador’?
A: Yeah, yeah. Back in the same place of all weird things. But then we had to retire cause I was,
didn’t have another post and I was almost 65. Had to get out at 65, unless you were, had another

residential post. But then for six years I worked in the State Department. I went around to
embassies in Africa and the far east teaching them about crisis management, counter terrorism.
Until they decided that was, they didn’t have money for that operation. It was stupid. They
abandoned that and they started up again after the attacks in Nairobi. But then I did other stuff
for the State Department. I did a lot of teaching classes. I did declassification. I got involved in
other things here. I was head of the Explorers club. I was head of the American Legion post,
president of my Princeton class. So I’ve kept busy.
Q: Can you talk just a little bit about how your war experience influenced you. You said it
inspired you to go into foreign service.
A: Yeah it did. I think there was no doubt about that. I think I was predisposed to that sort of
thing anyway because of my family’s general interest in foreign affairs and being Anglophiles as
it were. And so I never had any regrets about that. I mean some people jump faster than I did. I
don’t know. You never can tell. At the same time I was offered a job in Morocco. I was offered a
very good one in Vietnam but we had just gotten married and we didn’t particularly want to do
that. You never know with all these forks in their lives. But I can’t complain. I had a very
interested all along. I think the foreign service 1s still a wonderful way of life. It’s much less
exciting 1n some ways than it used to be. People don’t do it as a long time career. Many people
just do it as a, to see what it’s like for a while and then jump into something else. Sorry to see
that happen but —
Q: What are your feelings when you walk inside the Holocaust Museum in Washington?
A: Well I’ve done it I guess a number of times. Probably not as, five or six times, maybe not
more. Incidentally one of the people that I had met at the first time, 1t was, had been locked up in
Dachau. He was a major, picked up as a boy and eventually was a major in the Belgian army.
We got to be very good friends. I went to see him in Belgium twice. He wrote a very long paper
in French about, sort of an autobiography. He wanted me to translate it. Well, I couldn’t do that,
but I said look, they can do that at the Holocaust Museum so I will give it to them. And I did. I
took it over. I manufactured or helped him write a thank you note to him, did all that. And they

seemed to be happy to have it. I don’t know if they’Il ever use it again. But he was happy. And
then one of the times I went after. Not only did I get a letter to him, from them but — and I went
to one of these stores and picked up some medals. Whenever, at one time we had a ceremony
and I handed him a couple of American medals. Made him happy. He has since died. I was on
the phone with him a lot. But then to go back into some of the people I’ve kept up with. I don’t
know how much time you want to talk about that. But it was basically when I went back in 95
that I heard some of the stories of the extraordinary stories of the prisoners.
Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer
collection interview with AlanLukens. This is track number two and you were talking about how
you have kept up with many of the people.
AlanWood Lukens: Yeah and not only the Belgian I was just talking about, the great friend. But
two others that’ve I’ve particularly met and one I’ve been in very close touch with ever since. A
Frenchman named Joaquin Cote was among a group of French resistance youths in a mountain
town about half an hour away from Geneva, an Alpine village called Hagrepoche. In Christmas
of 1943, there was a small castle there and 35 of these young people mostly men but some girls,
decided they could have a Christmas party. The Germans were too far away and that they would
be safe on Christmas day in this small castle.
So they had a party. Unfortunately one of — there was a Vichy-ite there who heard about this and
informed the Germans. They came up all drunk in the middle of the party. They killed all but
five people, burned the chateau. Five people played dead but they were arrested the next day.
One of them was Joaquin Cote. They were sent from camp to camp. A horrible situation all the
way through. Four of them died along the way. Only Joaquin Cote made it. I met him in 1995.
And because of that became great friends. I went back in the 2000s, in 2005 and in 2009 I guess
it was or somewhat. Suzy and I went over to their village and he had died, but the son has been a
very close friend ever since. They stayed with us in Washington and we went over there, went to
several services, made speeches and laid wreaths and so on.

We’re going to see him this year. He and his wife are close friends. That was one story. He kept
saying well I was the one that saved his father. Well I didn’t because he, obviously, was one of
the many survivors. Through him there two or three other veterans from that village that I’ve
seen. They’ve given me their stories and so on. Another curious story from another friend. He
was on a train in Germany being hauled as prisoners on their way to Dachau. The train got stuck
in a little valley between two tunnels. They were all French on board. They were afraid that they
would be attacked by allied planes who were bombing German troop trains. And the tore up their
clothes and put it on top of the freight car, red white and blue tricolor to help the allies spot them.
And then finally one of these guys that I met in Tskuri, he and a Polish friend walked back along
the tracks about two miles to, through the Germans to the Americans, where the Americans were.
They got a bulldozer to go down the tracks, open it up and pull this one car back to the American
camps where they were all of course welcomed and eventually brought back.
Q: Do you remember his name?
A: Yeah that was Funfred was his name and I went to see him in Grenoble. I think I have more
names in some of these. If I give you one of these, you’ll have some of the --. So that was
another interesting story. But there were, everybody had an interesting story. One of the
wonderful people when we went back this year in 2010, whom I hadn’t met before but -- him
before and he always spoke English because I had my son and my grandson along which helped.
A wonderful man and he was down to 70 pounds or something. Now he lives in southern
France. But his story was really unbelievable that every day the Germans, the Nazi guards would
count the number of bodies or the number of people standing and thereby decide how much food
would be rationed. And so many were dying each night that they would carry the bodies out,
stand them up so that there would be a larger ration. He told us that story. It was really
extraordinary. I keep up with him. He lives in southern France, wonderful man.
Q: You had said in one of your articles that when you went back to Dachau that you had, you
delivered a message from President Barack Obama. Can you talk about that?
A: Oh sure. That was difficult to get cause he had done one for the other camp, but I went to my

good friend Chris Van Hollen, our congressman, and he said he would help. And he did. I wrote
a letter to the president, backed up by Chris Van Hollen. He kept helping. Went to a, the annual
baseball party at George Will’s that year and then Biden was there. I asked him to help. I don’t
know if he ever did, but I kept pushing and we didn’t get any answer. So finally got through to
some White House guy and he said oh yeah he’!I do it but — and I suggested what he might say
even but finally at the very last minute, a fax came to the hotel in Dachau where I was staying
that morning. I had already worked up my speech by sort of semi quoting him. But this time I
was able to do it. Got his -- so I could actually -- but that was sort of a last minute exercise.
Yeah, here is my speech. And here. It was actually I had written the speech and then I was going
to slough over that or say I hope one, but then finally this is the message that came in time so I
was able to —
Q: From the president?
A: Yeah, work that in. I think he used practically the same speech that he did for Buchenwald.
But it was Chris Van Hollen and his -- cause he kept driving him to do something. I had been to
— I knew all that — I knew Chris fairly well and I had been to an event here in Chevy Chase.
This is sort of funny. There’s a wonderful Romanian.
Q: Do you think the world has learned any lessons from the Holocaust?
A: Well I would hope so and I think the museum deserves a lot of credit for keeping it up. It was
a wonderful event this year and before also.
Q: The 20" anniversary?
A: The 20" anniversary with the -- I suppose they said there were 120 veterans there. I really
didn’t see very many but I guess they were. And of course of all the survivors. We had a very
fascinating dinner that night and they put us with one of the big supporting families of the
museum.

Q: Did you talk to any survivors from Dachau?
A: That night?
Q: Yes.
A: No, there wasn’t anybody that had been anywhere near. Well some had visit — a lot of people
had visited Dachau of course. No, I didn’t, there wasn’t anybody else around that had been to
Dachau as a soldier or as a survivor. I mean plenty of them had visited later of course, yeah. No
it was a very nice occasion. It was interesting the next morning to hear Jimmy Carter.
Q: Bill Clinton
A: Bill Clinton who was wonderful.
Q: Is there any part of the museum that you relate to or —
A: Well one of the things, we had the three years in Denmark and I got very involved there with
Danes. They have a wonderful museum and I, at one of these, I think it was the 90, it was 2000 I
guess when we were there. We ended up with a whole lot of Danish veterans, the survivors and
actually were invited to a very special thing the night before the big event out in a little section of
Dachau where they had lit candles and we were invited cause we just happened to meet the
Danes and because we had been in Denmark. So I kept up and then it got, and the Holocaust
museum they have that wonderful boat.
Q: The boat.
A: In there. So it was — The other day when I was in there I wanted to see it alone or just to see it
and so I ended up going up backwards so I went all the way through that way. There was a lot
more to see and I need to get over there more often. I should.

Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 32
June 11, 2013
Q: I was just wondering if you related to the liberation section, you know when the camps were
liberated?
A: Yeah, oh yeah, very much so and the special deck, oh yeah absolutely. No I specifically
went to that. And I should go there more often. It just 1s always seems difficult to get down and
park which and so on -- is not.
Q: Did your experience during the war affect how you raised your children?
A: I don’t know. That’s a hard one to answer. I mean I think that we, they were all part of our
foreign service and I don’t think that they knew much about it, but it was all very separate from
the war until more recently. Now I took my son last year, Suzy couldn’t go but I took my son
Tim and my grandson Chase over for the special thing in 19, in 2010. And each of them wrote
about that. For example there’s an article by my son Tim.
Q: What was your grandson’s reaction?
A: He was very impressed. He was at that point at Brooks school and now he’s at University of
Vermont and he wrote quite an article about it. I think he was really very moved by it. It was
wonderful to have them both there. And then talked to my friend Cote, who came back for this.
And for this other fellow who had — let me think, remember his name right now. In one of the
articles here. He is now living in Provence, who spoke English.
Q: Did the experience that you went through affect your feelings, of course you were very
young, you were only in your early 20s, affect you religiously, spiritually. Did 1t make you more
religious? Again you were quite young at the time.
A: It’s hard to say. I was brought up as a Protestant, an Episcopalian and always went to the
services that they had, the chaplains.

June 11, 2013
Q: The evil that you saw, the box cars and the crematorium, did that have any influence on you?
A: I don’t know. Not directly. I have to — I continued to be a supporter of the church where I
was, wherever I was and so on. But it, I wouldn’t say there was a direct connection except that —
Q: What are your thoughts about Germany?
A: Well it’s, 1t took me a long time to get very enthusiastic about Germans. Maybe it was a little
bit my father that was in both wars and felt the same way pretty much. But and I learned a little
bit of German here and there. And then but one interesting thing I hadn’t mentioned but I will
quickly. At that first one in 95, I sat next to a German general at a big dinner the night before. He
was the head of the medical department. And that was quite a dinner that I did get into or some
of us did. Anyway he asked if I would talk to his medical students men and women, about what
happened. I said yes, of course I would. So I by that time, the next day or something we went to
Salzburg for a little thing. I took the train back. And a day or two later a German colonel that
made the hotel which still struck me as odd, took me out and had lunch at the German
headquarters with about 25 officers and they brought up, that was kind of bizarre. They found a
kid of my age, then age, 21. A private in the German army, kind of made him sit there to see
what it was like. That was a little bizarre.
But they were all very nice and they were all, some had been also in NATO fans. We had given a
big award to this German general, his medical thing. So at the lunch he invited me to go into this
auditorium where there were about a hundred medical students, boys and girls in their 20s I
guess. And he said that they had almost all spoke English. Well I don’t know. I spoke in English
obviously and fairly slowly and I told them all about my experience. And got a standing ovation
at the end. I don’t know how much they got out of it but it was fascinating to do that.
On the way back from this last time on Lufthansa, I sat next to a German general of all things.
And he was very nice. After all, as you’ve said you get used to the fact that they are our allies
and that and I made a point in my speech everywhere for and there that, particularly that we were
all, this would never happen again. And that it’s there somewhere, anyhow. We’re all allies and
that we would all together believe in the slogan of never again. And I complimented him on the

fact that at all of these events, they brought in all kinds of German high school and college kids.
And I’d say most of the crowd there in 2010 were Germans. Well maybe half German and half
survivors. It was hard to tell, a couple of thousand people there. But now they have a wonderful
ladies, German ladies that run the new welcome center. And they were the ones that I dealt with
beforehand and got on the program. And they were very worried. It was funny. Ahead of time,
that the initial rivalry between the three divisions would make it odd. I represented all American
troops unless I get a clearance from the other divisions. So I did. I knew the guys in each one. I
called up and said look I’m going to be back there. And I just speaking for the 20". I happen to
be -- all of us who were there in 45. Do you mind? Oh no, no that’s fine. You can represent us.
They were -- track them down. One from each division somewhere in this country.
And but it’s funny that the German organizers were afraid that somehow this would come up,
that if I spoke — anyway we cleared all that. But so I think enough time has gone by so that
anybody that was there at all and still living -- cause an awful lot have died.
But I certainly got into this because at the end I became president of the retirees of the 20"
armored division. I did that for about five years. I organized several of our reunions and the
biggest one was at West Point, just before this, actually the same year, 2010. And that’s — they
had one more we didn’t get to and now they’re going to — they wanted to go back and have a
final one at Camp Hamilton Kentucky. I’m not sure I want to go back there.
Q: When you had these reunions do you talk about Dachau and —
A: Yeah and I gave a special talk that year about going back to Dachau and what had happened.
And there was a funny reaction to that. The people who hadn’t seen Dachau didn’t seem to care
about it. I mean it was weird because that was only a very —
Q: You mean the people who hadn’t been there initially?
A: In our division. There were really very few had, who had and the others were, had lots of
other war stories and about taking Munich and all that but they didn’t —
Q: They were not physically in —

A: They had never seen it and weren’t particularly shocked by it until they — so I didn’t make a
big point but I told them what had happened. It was kind of curious. But and I didn’t, I criticized
the other people, maybe as a contrast that I had such a fascinating career afterwards. To some of
them, this was not the Dachau but the fact of being in the 20", and in the war was probably the —
I don’t mean to sound disparaging but the biggest thing in their lives. They went back to their
small places where they lived and brought up and that was fine. That wasn’t true of all of them.
There was one guy in Tucson when we had our thing there, that he had done a lot of speaking
and he had — he just died. He was a very good man and we went, at our reunion there. He rallied
around and found all of the survivors and a number of Holocaust who were Jewish refugees and
people so that was very interesting. So it didn’t apply to everybody but I would say to some that
it was that Dachau was not, except for those of us who saw it, was not the main —
Q: When you meet survivors, do you automatically tell them that you were in the army and you
were —
A: Well yeah I’m not pushing it at them but if they ask and so on, yeah.
Q: You don’t volunteer it in other words?
A: I do, I do. I mean if I find that they are survivors of the war, I yes, I tell them right away,
yeah. And they are always interested I must say, even if they’ve come from another camp, like
Buchenwald or something.
Q: Do you read a lot about that time? And those places?
A: Not as much as I should. I’m just getting Atkinson’s new book on the war. I don’t know. I
don’t do as much reading as we should.
Q: Did you read on it?

A: Well off and on I have sure, I don’t know. I think that the — we don’t read as much as we
should. Too many newspapers and articles.
Q: When you, you’ve been on the inside but when there are articles and programs on other
genocides —
A: Well I’ve because I’ve had so much time in Africa I watch that very much —
Yeah, the Congolese thing is to continue a horrible mess down there. Rwanda is the same thing.
Q: So again because you were —
A: But that’s more of my African connection than the Dachau one except that one genocide is as
— as another kind of
Q: Do you feel you have a deeper understanding because you saw it up close when you were 21
years old?
A: Yeah, I think so. Although it’s funny because the, it was so far back and then I had all my
foreign service career and this and that and it was really toward the end of that, when I had time
to go to these reunions and work on them and go back to Dachau, that it brought it back much
more than the intervening years when we were traveling in Africa and the kids were so young
and all that. Well thank you, I’ve enjoyed this. I guess that covers things pretty well.
Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add before we —
A: I just want to thank you. I think it’s wonderful that you are doing this and you and other
volunteers. And I did tell the different people at the museum at one point that I’m hoping to
make speeches. Nobody has asked me at this point, but if anybody wants to I’m still available to

Q: Wonderful, wonderful.
A: You asked one funny question about the Germans. Well it’s interesting because the German
embassy here, I came back at one point. They had one of their young attaches that was supposed
to sort of take care of this kind of a thing. And follow up on -- it was a little odd, but I went over
and spoke there once at the German embassy to the young officers about what had happened.
That was a couple of years ago.
Q: What was their reaction?
A: Well they were interested, they asked questions. I was a little bit cynical or skeptical. I think
that they were trying to be on the right side of everything by bringing it up. And I was happy to
do it but it’s, I thought it was a little kind of an unusual event. Well thank you very much.
Q: Thank you. This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer
collection interview with AlanLukens.
