A: No, it must be, oh yeah here , yeah, I told you, I thought that it was August the second, it was August the first, 1942. Q: Uh-huh. Now, so this original synopsis that I have of this c onversation, that's incorrect, because it says 1940. A: No, because I didn't have this paper in Brussels with me, but now I saw, if you come and get everything together, yeah, yeah see. Q: 1942, so between, you lived in Marneff(ph) before you went to France, walked to France, or after? A: We walked from Marn eff(ph) ______ _________. Q: You walked from Marn eff(ph) towards Paris? A: Everybody in that cam p, we walked, yeah, yeah. Q: Right, and then you turned ar ound, and then, but then you would have come back in 1939 or 1940. A: Yeah. Q: So, it was two years that you were living in Brussels? A: Yeah, we were quite free because the Germ ans invaded Brusse ls in May '40. Q: So between May '40 and August '42, weren't you living in fear? A: Yes, well you know. Q: But you didn't have to hide? A: No, we didn't have to hide, but we had to wear th e star, you know. Q: Because I, you know, just from all of these th ings that I've read, about the scrubbing squads, where the Jews had to scrub the streets. A: Oh, that was in Vienna. Q: That was in Vien na, okay, well I'm sorry, I wa s, now I'm ___ ____________. A: And that, yeah, I forgot, no I forgot to tell you something. 18 Q: We need to go ba ck and talk a little bit about that as well. A: Yeah, okay, yeah. Q: Let me . . . A: Yeah, everybody had to scrub the streets and they took me and my husband at the time, he had the Polish citizenship and then we didn't have to scrub because we were Polish citizens, and my husband drove a car near the, it's an ____________ and that's the Po lish flag, so nothing happened to him. But then he had a cust omer and he went in that store and the Germans came and said we need some Jews for the camp, in the store. My husband was with the back to them, and he said, Jack, why don't you go in my office and they were prot ecting him, he wa s very lucky. Q: So, I also wanted to ask y ou about, in Vienna, before the _______________, there was the Anschluss. A: Oh, the Anschluss was . . . Q: What's your recollection of that? A: There was, on March '38, and it was from '38, from March until, well it was terrible, I told you on the benches, no Jews allowed and the women _______________ the stores and it was very, very bad. People had to wa sh the streets and they stood around laughing. Q: Now you describe growing up as a child not be ing exposed to anti-Semitism. Were you aware that it existed in the world, that some people didn't like Jews? A: There was a mayor once, long , long ago, I don't know, not in my time, he was with the government and he said, who's a Jew? I'm going to sa y who's a Jew. It was only in politics, not the people. But then Austri a lost the war and there were a lot of unemployed people , so where ever there, the Socialists, saw that it's going to be better, so they were Socialists, and they set the Parliament on fire once, long before Hitler and then they said, okay when we have Hitler, we'll be happy, we'll live happy ever afte r because they were poor, they had no jobs and the women of course, the Viennese are terrible. Very, very bad. Q: But do you think that suddenly, these feelings they had in side them of not liking Jews were suddenly let loose? 19 A: Yeah, because when Hitler came to Vienna, there was a shortage of onions, they said sure, the Jews like onions, the Jews ate the onions, that's why we didn't have onions. Women you know have nothing to do with politics. Q: Now, but as, you were still, you were not a child any more when this happened. A: No, I was 28. When we left I was married for four years. Q: At the same time you were yo ung enough to probably, if you had, if you had believed that people were fair minded, this whole arrival of Anschl uss and then of course , the _______ _________, it must have been a shock to you. A: Of course it was a terrible shock, but we're, Hitler came the first night and I wanted to leave right away, but my mother still had a job and my husband had a job and my brother was in the first World War, he was a capt ain in the Austrian army and he got _______________ medal. Nothing is going to happen to me, he said, I was in the war. You can't imagine, you don' t believe it. Look, in Germany, it never happened like this, because why di dn't Jewish people come from Germany in '32, when Hitler came in '32 and they were right next door and look. We __________ _____, we just didn't believe that it could happen to us. Q: When you left, did you think th at you were leaving for good, or did you have a dream to come back? A: You know, at this moment, I don't know, you don't think, yo u couldn't think, otherwise you would get crazy. I don't know. You can't. If you would thin k, you would just get crazy. Q: So that the way to surv ive is to just put one foot in front of the other? A: Yeah, we were just thinking where to go and how to go. So we had no other possibility, so we went illegally to Belgiu m and we were lu cky they didn't send us back. Q: And you didn't ta lk about, what's happening to us, why are they doing to us, or did you? A: I don't know. It was terrible, of course. An d after the ______________ _, and yeah, and then we went to Belgium, and we could have let my mother come to Belg ium because we had that man who really was nice to us, the person, man who went to school with my husband's father. And at the frontier, we could have gone in Be lgium to the frontier and really, and my mother said nothing is 20 going to happen to me, I' m old, I have a pension. You don't believe it. Yo u couldn't believe it, you wouldn't believe it. It was terrible. And on the way back you k now, from France, we saw things spread all over, the people could take as much as they could carry, and cameras, you name it, everything in the world, terrible. Beautiful th ings, nobody picked it up because. I had a gold bracelet, was nothing to it, but we always had ci garettes to smoke on the _______________. Which is the reason why I have had an operation on my veins b ecause it didn't get in on the lungs, but in my veins. Q: The idea of hiding . . . A: Yeah? Q: You know, on th e one hand you have people wh o are risking their lives. A: Yeah, I ask them . . . Q: And on the other hand, there's just this terrible in justice that you have to hide, so that it must be like this . . . A: Injustice. Q: Well, I don't even know . . . A: It's an injustice they came on the _ _______________ too and took everything. Q: Of course, I'm just, I wanted to just ask you a little bit, I guess two things, two things. Do you recall how you felt during those days when you were hiding? A: We never knew when the bell rang whether it was the Gestapo or th e milkman and you had not too much to eat, so. One man wa s very stingy, was _____________ __, do you have that too? He was a mining engineer and they ha d the key to the freezer house where the meat was, the Germans, so one day they went in to ____ ________ and they stole pigs, two pigs. Do you have that? Did I tell that that lady too? So everybody got ham and we ate pig for two weeks, the main ____________ got and everybody, th e whole street and we were hidden across from a German, you know where the Germans lived and one day the wh ole street was closed and I think some high officer came from German y, and they said it was the best to be hidden across from where the Germans lived, because they didn't suspect that there were Jews ther e. It was at _______________. 21 Q: You were right across from the Germans? A: Yeah, yeah. It was very, very bad. And lo ok, you _______________, any day they come and get you, you live with the fact that that's what it is. Q: And at the same time, if this went on for a couple of years, you must have developed into some kind of routine. A: No, you never do, I don't think we did. No, we were just, you know , shit happens, it happens. Q: Were you always scared all the time? A: No. You don't . . . Q: Did you get bored sometimes? A: Bored, no. Q: Not bored either. A: No, no. They were r eally, really nice to us, the people wh o were hiding us and maybe it wasn't so much the love of the Jews, bu t the hate against the Germans beca use they had them in the first World War too, the Germans and I think they were much worse to the whole population then, terrible. Q: Do you think that there may have also been some, was there something about, you know, just reaching out to another human bein g that was in their motivation? A: No. Q: What else do you th ink motivated them to help these different fa milies, to help you? A: Well, they were good people. When they said, we're going to hi de you, I said, you hardly know us and we ____________ because we just bought ciga rettes there. So I said, what if they send you to jail? But they hated them so much, and it was an English sp y, and we took the messages from the BBC, the _________________ means, the route is, how do you call it? Q: Long and winding? A: Winding, yeah. Q: The route is long and wi nding, what did that mean? A: The next day they bombed in Germ any. I don't know what it meant. 22 Q: But there was a message over the . . . A: There was a message ove r the radio and the next day they we re bombing a factory over there in Germany, so, important things. You just live from one day to the other and if it happens, it happens. Q: Were you ever surprised by the courage or the co mmitment of the people who housed you? A: Yeah, I just told you, I told th em right away, why do you hide us, they're going to put you in jail or they kill you, oh no, n o. Their hate was so big against the Germans that they would do anything, anything to, oh yeah, on the street , between '39 and '40, they're all se nt in the wrong directions, the Germans, so one German said to the other in German, be careful, they send us the wrong way. We understood, you know, we understood German. And that George Millot(ph), he went with two bums on the public transportation, the tramway(ph). They, right next to a German. There was such hate for the German s that they, terrible, they burned holes in their uniforms with cigarettes. Q: So they were, in a sense, a part of the Belgian resistance. Was th ere much contact, or was it . . . A: Not only Belgian, _______________ in France and in Belgium. Q: And how much did they have a connection with the committee for the defens e of the Jews? Was that related at all, I mean, I've been reading a little bit about the CDJ, you know, the _______________. A: Yeah, well that's it, we had, th ey knew there were Jews and they knew all the names and that's, because this, delivered through the Jews community. Q: So the CDJ was basically the connection between, that 's how you got to be with these people, through the CDJ? A: But see, yeah, in Vienna, I think in Germany too, it's a law th at all the Jews have to register in the Jewish community a nd that they took over in Belgium too, because look, so this day, delivered through the Jewish Committee. I told you the native Jews in Brussels , nobody knew they were Jewish and then in our pa ssport, they had a J, Jewi sh, if you had a passport. Q: Now when you were staying, th e place that you stayed, the last place you stayed was at the . . . A: Madame Boeskay(ph) again, we went back. Q: Boeskay(ph), okay. 23 A: We were sitting in the k itchen and Paris is free, oh my God, that was beautiful. Q: And was Monsieur Boes kay(ph) killed for . . . A: No, he wasn't killed, not Monsieur Boeskay(ph), no. Q: Oh, then I was thinking of somebody else. A: No, Millot(ph) was killed and his son came back from the concentration camp. Q: Okay. A: And yeah, Bernard Hubec(ph) for awhile, had to hide himself and he went in a little village near, yeah he put a gun near the river and made them _______________, and that he killed himself, that he went in the river, okay. Q: He pretended, he faked it? A: Yeah, yeah. Q: This is Bernard Hubec(ph)? A: Yeah, Bernard Hubec(ph). But he was hidden himself because he belonged, he was a spy, so his wife went to visit him every week there and after the war he had a hard time to get a life again, because he was dead for the co mmunity, for the you know, do you have that too, maybe? Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Yeah. So he had hard time to get to make himself a life again, which makes sense, because in the paper it says he killed himself and they found, they really believed it, even the Belgian people believed it. They found th e gun and he was hiding. Q: Do you remember the story, yo u would have been in hiding then, in 1943, of train number 20? The train from Mecklin(ph) to Ausc hwitz, that was derailed, I don't know if it wa s derailed but there was a story of the Belgian resistance, it was a train going to the death camps that was stopped. A: No. Q: I'm just . . . A: I didn't tell it. Q: No, no, you didn 't tell it, I was just wondering if you, that was one of the stories of some of the . . . 24 A: I know another story, I know, they all knew that, from Mecklin(ph), they all went to Auschwitz, they knew it, that they went to their deaths, they all knew it and there was a couple, a girl and a young man and they both ju mped from the train and th ought if we die, we die and they got married. That's how they met each othe r, on that train, sure. Q: Both jumping off? A: Yeah. Q: Were you aware of, how aware were you, I guess, of what was go ing on outside while you were . . . A: Oh no, there was a condition, one condition that they would hide us, nobody, but nobody knew we were hidden and I coul d write to my brother who lived in a, not too far aw ay from Brussels, with his non-Jewish wife and he did not, he got the mail but he didn't know wh ere we were, because he could, you know, _________ ______, nobody knew we were hidden there. I told you how relatives didn't know that th ey had somebody. End of Tape 1 25 Tape 2 A: . . . never went to anyone. Q: But, were you aware of what was going on outside? A: Yes of course, oh yes. Q: Through the BBC? A: No, through, they were, the whole family was ___ ____________, there was a woman, she was related and she went with the children's transport, going to France to save the Jewish transport, we knew that. And then she called an d said, you better don't go out, they have a bad cold, but she meant _______________ on th e street they took the people, and I was workin g with a girl, she was Jewish, but she was blonde, blue-e yed, they came to her apartment, the Gestapo, they wanted to take her and she said , oh my God, what do you want of me, I' m not Jewish and they left. That's something to do, you know. You ha ve to be, you had to be brave and you had, you know, just live, that's it. Q: Because at the time, I mean people were like 10 or 12 peopl e a day were being taken off the street at this time, ri ght, it must have been incredibly terrifying. A: I know, and there was an officer and they said he went, it wa s a man and he said , there's a Jew, there's a Jew and they took him in the Jeep or wh atever it was, you never saw that man or woman again, and I think I saw them once. Looked at me, they lo oked back at ____. Or I was really like dressed long and no make-u p and they didn't think I was Jewish. Just that had to have luck and you just lived in the day and what's tomorrow and it's just, I guess if somebody has cancer, that's how it must feel. Q: And while you were in hiding , you obviously couldn't have any contact with your family. A: No, I just told you, there was one condition. Q: I know. And I'm just wonderi ng, because of that, were you wondering about your family in Vienna all the time? A: Of course. My mother didn't want to go, I told you she had a pension and I'm old, nothing is going to happen. You couldn't believ e it, just couldn't believe it, that 's it. And then, yeah, she's in 26 that book and my mother-i n-law is in that book and my sister. And one sister survived, she was in ________________ during the war I think. Sh e came to America, but sh e died in 1974 I think. Q: Are you able to talk about your mother and your sister. A: Yeah, well, maybe sad to talk. Q: What happened?

It says in this book. Q: ________________ is? A: ________________ was one of the same, beautiful camp, becaus e the Germans they knew from, in America, that the Germans were very bad and they gassed the people, so they showed, they took the Germans to _______ _________ to show them what a beautiful camp it was, and it seemed everything was nice there, but they didn't stay fore ver, they took them, it says in that book, to Auschwitz. Q: They took them from ___ _____________ to Auschwitz? A: Yeah, and there was some poe ts in ________________ and musi c and you know, always if the Red Cross made an inspect ion, everything was just fine, but I' m sure the Germans knew what was going on, because they lived arou nd there. They must have known. And then so many people denied that it ever ha ppened, you know that. Q: Still they are today. A: Now, sure, of course. _______________, I'm afraid. Q: You think so? A: Yeah. Q: Why do y ou say that? A: They have the skinheads and th e yeah. Look, we never dreamed in Aust ria that it would happen to us and we were, I don't know, 40 miles from Germany. Were we st upid or what? I don't know. 27 And it happened. No, really, I wa nted to leave right away when I saw them, I loved Vienna, I was born there, my mother was born there, but I, I just knew. Q: How do you thin k of Vienna now? A: It's a beautiful city, we went back. No, there was a time, I was dreaming I had to go back to Vienna and I woke up crying, and never, I could never be, no, I still wouldn't live in Vienna now. No but, I mean then, I wouldn't go back, not for a second. And one day we were in Zurich in Switzerland, from America, you know, just traveling, and I said, listen, let's just go th ere, out of our minds if we came for one week and just go there as a tourist, and th at's the first time we went back to Vienna. Q: This was in '86, did you say? A: No, no, '86, no. Q: Oh, that was the last time I guess you were back you said. A: Yeah. Q: I'm sorry, wh en was this? A: Oh, that was much earlier, I don't know when. '72? I don't know. Q: So it was quite a while, you were gone for 30 years. A: Yeah. And then we went in a group, in fact it was a Jewish group, it wa s the B'Nai B'rith, maybe you heard about it, and the group was through the B'Nai B'rith, they were all Jewish of course, these people were, mostly Americans, and when I saw young pe ople, young people from Vienna, it didn't bother me, because they weren't alive when Hitler was, they were born after the wa r, but when I saw some people my age, it was, and then, you know, they're always, Vie nnese are, were always famous for complaining. And then we went another time to Vienna, and we're st anding waiting for bus, and they said, you're terrible now, ther e are no Jews to compla in about, but there were some people from all over, from Czechoslovakia, lik e now in America from, they come from Mexico, illegal. Yeah, they're bad, and oh, you know, ____ ________ my age, they are fat, they look terrible and they are mean. We were sitting in the stre et car, there was a young man, he was Viennese, he was Christian, I don't know what he was, there wa s a woman, I just sit there, like in a movie. Terrible, terrible, 28 terrible. Oh, we have so me friends, they're not Je wish, he was a professor in Vienna, the University, he came to America to t each at Harvard and oh he left, he made fun of the Viennese, he said, if you want to be a full professor in Vi enna, you have to wait until that one dies, so he went back to his friends, the University in 19- I don't know when, he ma de $75,000, which was much a lot then. They wouldn't believe him, you know. No, I will never live, ever never live in Europe again, ever. It's beautiful, but. Q: Too many bad memories? A: No, bad memories of course, but there's only one, oh and my son is real, re al, oh my God, they say there's only one country in the whole world, it 's America, because you can be, and you do what you want in America, you can be wh at you want and you ca n move from state to state. If you went to Bosnia, had to have a passport in Europe, talk the different langua ge. I went to Paris and don't go there if you don't speak the lang uage, because you'll get gypped, r eally. Went to Paris and they wanted to buy music in box to ta ke as souvenir to America, and ask, I was American, I talked English and she went in the, I sa id, how much is this, the woman said, went in the back room, how much is this for American in French, so sh e come back to ______ _________ and no merci beaucoups ________ ________ and _______________ just said, thank you.

Q: I guess I wanted to ask that maybe this wasn't something you thought about at the time, and maybe you've thought about it since then, but the question I wanted to ask was, and this is a difficult question to ask, so please . . . A: So, go ahead. Q: But, did you ever thi nk about why me, to have the fortune to survive? 29 A: No, I was very grateful and I alwa ys, of course we were glad to be here, just lucky. Very lucky, really. But you, there is not such a thing as being afraid. I guess all these people in the concentration camp, even they weren't afraid, because they said, what will be, will be and really, it's all I can say. Q: Did you stay in contact with the Boeskays(ph), or? A: Oh yeah, sure. Madame Boeskay(ph) died and he died of, he had a lot to do with his stomach, he died of cancer and then. Yeah, one granddaughter came to America and met my son in New York and she got the job in Texas. We ll, they all speak English of course, very good, very fluently English, everybody in Europe does. If they say they d on't it's not true, beca use, well I learned French in school, I was the best in the class and when I came to Belgium I wanted to buy a candle, so I didn't know French then, so I looked in th e dictionary and there we re two words for candle, ________________ de _______________, and I sa id the wrong thin g, _______________ is for the church, and the grocery store, they didn't know wh at a _______________ was, so he didn't know, so I drew him some matches, I drew him the candle, so he said, what you want, matches, you know.

And then the German soldiers came and they said we want eggs, in Ge rman, we didn't understand, we sa id we didn't understand German, what? So they said to the other one, she knows wh at we're saying, she doesn' t want to give us any, you know, you always had to enjoy whatever we had and the next day, it's the next day, that's it and somehow you get the strength, if not, you really get crazy. I guess you have to be st rong a little bit, I don't know. And I was always toge ther with my husband and whatever. Q: Boy that must have made a trem endous difference for both of you. A: Yeah. Q: To be going through this together, huh? 30 A: Oh, they finally got the affidavit to come to Am erica, we were supposed to go with the Il de France, and that was in strike, so we had to fly. Now we flew in January, in 1950, and there was only a propeller, no jet, and there was a snowstorm in New York and we couldn't land in New York, so we had to land in Washington, DC., so the ticket co unter, there was a line of us standing in line to get a ticket back from Washington DC. to New York, where our relatives waited. Everybody looked at me, they were all black people then, in 1950 still. I was the only white, I didn't realize, why does the people look at me? And then on the train, we took the train back, that's when we made our first $76, I remember. He said, how do you want to go, we pay your freight, do you want a sleeper, or do you want a regular seat ______ ______ Washington DC. to New York, so I said, no regular, so we got $76 back. So we got the airpor t, no, Grand Central Station, because there was a train, so my husband called his cous in who gave us the affidavit. He said, yeah, I'll be there in an hour, he lived in Brighton Beach, so my husband said to him, ta kes you so long? That's where I live, that's what it takes, an hour. Oh, my God.
