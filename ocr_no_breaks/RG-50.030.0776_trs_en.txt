Or how would you Œ overall, how would you descri be your childhood? A: Normal. I had friends, and through school I Œ I had none non-Jewish friends. In Œ when I was around 10 years old, we licked Œ lived in a mixed area, and I recall that we had Œ we had ballgames between Jews and Gentiles. Q: Okay. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 8A: And I didn™t really socialize with non-Jews, and I guess I grew up in a normal Œ normal way. As I said though, but I was always helping my Œ my parent earn a living, and so I got through. Nothing Œ no thing outstanding, it™s just a normal Œ a normal life. Q: I™m curious about the ballgames. How did they end up? Did Œ did Œ did Œ did the Jews and the Gentiles sort of split the wins and the losses more or less evenly, or di Œ were you the dominant team, or Œ A: Well, I was very good, whether it was baseball or football. And I guess it was a mixture. Sometimes we won, sometimes we lost. Q: Okay. So, you™re working as a jobber, distributing undergarments, socks, things of that nature Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ to various shops, more or less in the Washington , D.C. area, or did you have a large geographic area that yo u were responsible for? A: This is when I was living in south Baltimore. We had some customers in Œ in the area, the north Œ northwest Baltimore, but I recall I would go to the eastern shore, and there were stores in eastern Maryland . And where else? What Œ what™s another large Œ I Œ I would have customers in different parts of Œ of eastern shore. Q: Did you travel by car, or ca Œ Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 9A: Yeah, I had a car. And I had big suitcases , and I would take orders with whatever items they Œ they wanted.

When Œ were you conscripted, were you Œ A: I Œ I was drafted in November of 1942. Q: Okay. A: When I became 21. Q: Fair enough. Now, the war itself, when Œ A: I Œ Q: Œ did you first become a-aware? Were you Œ when did you first become aware, if at all, that this Œ Jews in Germany and throughout Europe were specifically being targeted for harassment and violence? Did you know before going in the service, or did you know ab Œ when did th at Œ exactly did that happen? A: I don™t recall. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 10Q: Okay. A: I don™t Œ Q: Let™s go back to conscription. A: Yes. Q: Were you given the opt ion of the European or Pacific theater? A: Well, let™s Œ first of all, I was drafted into elev Œ a Œ a new organization called 11th armored division. And we originated in Louisiana. I was in the 42nd tank battalion of the 11 th armored division, and I trained as a tanker. And because of my written tests that I took, plus the Œ the training I got, I was Œ I Œ I Œ I cou Œ I could have become a Œ an officer. At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service, specifically in Œ in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti Semitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to headquarters of 42 nd tank battalion, and so that™s what I did. And I became assistant to the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on Œ and as I was Œ I was Œ I was transferred to the Œ the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so that was my title, although I didn™t Œ when we went overseas, I didn™t do any typing or anything. I w Œ I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion commander gave instructions Œ wanted inst ructions to the Œ the adjutant. And of course, my being the noncom, I did the Œ whatever had to be done. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 11Q: Let™s go back to the Œ the na Œ the anti-Semitism that you experienced inside the army. A: Yes. Q: Talk about that, the nature of it. How did you feel it, how were you exposed to it? A: Well, what happened was, a Œ a incident, for example, during the growing of th Œ of the Œ of the division, of the company, the battalions. People were transferring in and out, and there was a Œ a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and the Œ several of Œ of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I said, I™m Jewish. They couldn™t understand. I didn™t look Jewish, my name wasn™t Jewish. And I says, well, you didn™t Œ you don™t see the horns coming out? At any rate, I Œ I had a different feeling with Œ with these soldiers, who were part of my tank Œ tank company. And so I didn™t feel comfortable going to officer training, coming back, and dealing w ith Œ with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the Germans. So, that was Œ that was why I transferred to the company. And course we didn™t have any Œ I didn™t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion headquarters. So that was Œ that was the experience I had. Q: Okay. Do you recall when and how you received your call-up notice? Where were you, how did you receive it? Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 12A: I was in Baltimore on my 21 st birthday. As I said, I wa s working for this jobber, and I got notice that I Œ I™m in Œ I™m drafted into the army. Q: How did you feel about that? A: I took it in stride. I knew I had to go, and so I had Œ Q: Where did you first go to training? Where was your initial training? A: In Louisiana . Q: What was it like? A: Camp Polk. Q: What was it like? A: Well, course it™s all new. As I said, I was in a tank battalion and I was in the Œ I was in C company, if I recall. And trained with others, learning all about tanks, and the armaments, and I was an expert with Œ with a submachine gun. Got a medal there, and I learned the 75 millimeter cannon. And I also trained, or learned the .45 pistol. And I learned my Œ I l earned the armaments very well. Q: Was it difficult? A: No, it™s Œ it™s practice, a lot of time. Q: So wa-was it a physical challenge, a mental challenge, or Œ A: Well, it™s both physical and mental. Q: Sure. But you did well. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 13A: Yes. Q: Okay. Certainly well enough to be solicited for officer training. A: Yes. Q: So. A: But I turned that down, as I said. Q: Right. A: Cause I didn™t feel comfortable if I came back as an officer. Although I recall there was a Jewish officer that was in one of the companies, and I don™t recall many Jewish soldiers after that. Q: How did you cross over to Europe , by boat? A: We went Œ yes. Q: When and where did you leave? A: Well, let™s see if – ah, we went over in December of 1944. Q: And that was by ship? A: By boat, yes, by ship. Q: And what harbor did you leave, do you remember? A: Well, we went to England . Q: Okay. A: We landed in England . Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 14Q: Did you stay in England for any length of time? A: Yeah, we stayed in England for quite a time. Q: What were you doing there, training and Œ A: We were training, yes. Q: What did you think of the English? A: I had no problems with them. If I recall, I even Œ I even dated a Œ a Jewish girl, and invited to Œ invited to the home, and Œ but that wasn™t anything more. And then, of course, we went over to France. Let™s see. On December 16, 1944, the Germans lonc Œ lanced a Œ a counterattack 50 mile radius in the Ardennes. And let™s see Œ okay, and then when Œ wh-when we went into France , our first assignment was to guard the Œ hold the section of the Moose River, where the German attack was expected, but on the t Œ the ti Œ December 26, the fourth armored broke through the German lines, and we leave Bastogne, where the 101st airborne had been Œ had surrendered, and Œ and so th e evening of December 31 st, ar Œ our division went to Œ had a 250 mile, or 150 mile march to Œ to Bastogne , where we were involved with the Œ the Œ the ban Œ Bastogne Œ what was it called? The Œ the Œ let™s see, where we became part of General Patton™s Third Army, and we were in the combat command A, and we went to Œ we Œ we went to Rechrival, Belgium . That was our first area, and it snowed very heavy. And a patrol di scovered over 101 infa ntry bodies dead. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 15They brought back an SS officer to our headquarters, and Œ and understanding Yiddish, I attempted to interrogate him, but I wasn™t too successful with the German, so they brought over interpreters from headquar ters that took over, and Œ and Œ and interviewed Œ inter Œ interr ogated him. I noticed the captain of D company was angered with the discovery of the American dead bodies, and he took some prisoners, lined them a Œ on the wall, and killed them. And I recall that I Œ I had to take the bodies and put them in Œ in bags. Q: Did Œ i Œ what was upsetting to comma nd and staff about the American bodies? Was it the nature? Did they appear to have been executed, or Œ A: What? Q: When you said that you found de Œ th e Œ the-the bodies, the American bodies. A: Yes. Q: And that upset people. A: Yes. Q: Wi Œ was it Œ did they die as the result of an Œ of a Œ of a combat engagement, or did they appear to have been captured and then executed? A: That™s wa Œ wa Œ they Œ they captured and executed. Q: Okay, so this is what Œ A: Yes. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 16Q: Œ got everyone Œ A: Very upset. Q: Correct. A: Yes, yes. Q: Including yourself. A: Yes. Q: Right. So you saw both the Americans, and then the subseque nt round-up of the Germans as well. A: Oh, of course. Q: Okay. A: Yes. Of course, our line companies did the Œ you know, captured the Germans and so forth. I was in headquarters Œ Q: Right. A: Œ and so I wasn™t directly Œ although Œ although once Œ once we captured the Œ the soldiers is Œ I was aware of what happened. Q: Yes. A: Yeah. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 17Q: Did you identify those parti Œ was it thought that those particular German soldiers who were captured were the ones who were responsible for the execution of the Americans? A: I don™t Œ I Œ I don™t think I felt that way. I Œ I didn™t know. Q: Right. A: I didn™t know. Q: But they were there. A: Yes. Q: And you were angry. A: Yes. Q: Okay. Do you real Œ hang on just for a moment, before we press on. A: Yeah. Q: Do you recall your very first engagement with the enemy? A: Personally? Q: Yes. A: I suppose it was when Œ when we captur ed a officer, and th Œ and the Œ the Œ my battalion commander asked me to interrogate the Œ he knew I was Œ he knew I was Jewish, and he thought maybe I had a Œ a Œ I was very versed in speaking German, Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 18which I wasn™t. So, I Œ I Œ I can™t tell you ho w I felt at the time. I think things lead up to what happens, and you take it as a matter of stride, I Œ I ge Œ I think. Q: Would you say retrospectively, lo oking back, when you™re there in Europe, the war in on proper, you™re part of it. A: Yes. Q: Did you feel that your training up to that point equipped you to deal with war? Did you feel as if you were prepared? A: Yes. Yes. As Œ as all the members of our division were. Q: Yes. A: Yes. Q: What Œ did you form an opinion of the enemy? Were they good soldiers, sloppy soldiers, were they Œ A: Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha Œ we set up a camp. I recall that we had some German soldiers that we made KP, and I-I-I was guarding Œ at one point I was Œ I was guarding Œ I Œ I did a various Œ various things. But one Œ at one time I Œ I was guarding prisoners, I reca ll telling this German that he wasn™t doing a good job of cleaning the large soup vats, and he tried to Œ he says, I™m doing the best I can. And Œ and that ended th at conversation. But I Œ I didn™t really have any direct contact, as such, with Œ with Œ with the German soldiers, other than, Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 19as I said, at one time I was there. O-Other times I would Œ I would go into a burnt out tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn™t want to leave any s-soldiers behind, so Œ Q: So these were Americans that you had to extract? A: These are Œ th-these are American, yeah. One of the tanks of Œ of one of our companies. So Œ Q: That had to have been extraordinarily traumatic. A: Yes. Yeah. Everything there was Œ it™s a Œ but we took things in stride. Soldiers did their job. We Œ we Œ we did well, and after Œ after we left bast Œ Bastogne, we Œ we traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany. Q: Were you engaging the en emy as you™re going along? A: Oh yes, of course. We™re all fighting, as i Œ as i Œ as Œ as I remember, the main force of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there™s still plenty of fighting going on, and we ge Œ our Œ our division fought and engaged the enemies as we went down. And then when we got down to Œ near Austria, as a Œ as I told you, General Patton was the Third Army commande r, and Œ and instructions were that we weren™t supposed to go into Austria . But Patton didn™t like Œ didn™t Œ didn™t like that, and so we went into austr Œ Austria also. And that™s where Œ okay, and as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the Œ Austria, and Œ and Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 20Patton didn™t like the Œ the Russians either. And so li Œ going down, one of our companies, one of the companies was making Œ was doing reconnaissance, and on the road Œ on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa Œ the commander of Œ of Œ of the Œ of Œ of the camp, was coming towards them, a Œ with a white flag, and they surrendered. And it turns out he was telling them of the Œ of the Œ of Mauthausen , that i-it was Œ it was five miles back. And the reason they Œ they wanted Œ they Œ they gave up to us, is they didn™t want the Russians, because the Russians would Œ would Œ would just kill them. And so that was how we learned of Œ of the concentration camp. The next morning, I went with the battalion commander and the adjutant in to the camp. That was my first seeing it. And of course, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of dead bodies. And then I went into the Œ into the camp, and I went into a particular Œ wait a minute, I™m Œ I™m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the survivors. And I asked, is there anything that Œ Q: Now, hang on just for a moment Œ A: Yeah, yeah. Q: You spoke with some of the survivors because you spoke Yiddish Œ A: Yes Q: Œ you were speaking in Yiddish Œ Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 21A: Yes. Q: Œ not Œ not Œ not English, correct? A: Yeah, English, yeah. Q: Okay, so tell me about yo ur conversations with them. A: And so, I said, is there anything I can do. And I recall several coming to me and saying, could you write a le tter to my relative in Chicago , if I remember that Œ that was Œ that particular situation. And so I to ok the information, and I did write a letter to I Œ I don™t recall having an-any copies, so I Œ I don™t know, bu-but this is my memory, that I wrote a letter and told of that Œ that this person was safe. And so that stood out in my mind. Q: What did you think as you were approaching the camp? Before you entered the camp proper, did you know what its purpose was? A: No. Q: Did you Œ A: No. Q: So as you™re approaching it, what do you see? A: Well, I saw Œ what Œ what happened was, the German Œ there was a big quarry, and the Germans got cement out of there. And what they Œ they used, they set up this Œ th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that Œ that had to work in Œ in the Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 22quarries. And that is Œ that is how the camp came about. And the Œ the prisoners worked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha Œ wi Œ wi Œ the Œ w-with Œ wi Œ which would be the cement that they would be making. So what was my first Œ I-I Œ this has been a long time, so I Œ I really Œ I really can™t remember how I felt in Œ in seeing it. Q: Were there still Germans Œ and then ba Œ by that I mean soldiers, inside the camp, or not? A: Well, what we did, wa Œ we Œ we Œ tho Œ our Œ our line companies went in, and of course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course. And of course our Œ our company Œ comp anies took them out, and we eventually took them back to headquarters. But as I said, I wa s in the headquarters of the battalion, and I didn™t physically get involved with Œ with the soldiers there. We Œ we had our other Œ you know, others that were doing it. Q: Once you and the battalion were inside the camp proper, what did you have to do? Did you have to start gi ving medical attention, did you start distributing food? A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. We have a Œ a medical battalion with us, and so they went in and did what they had to do, yes. Q: And did you feed the prisoners, or was that not in your Œ did you Œ did you give them food, did you give the prisoners food, or Œ Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 23A: I-I Œ I can™t tell you, but the Œ th-the company Œ the soldiers in the Œ in the various companies did what you had to do . So I didn™t Œ I personally wasn™t involved with that. Q: Okay. But you understood, if no Œ if for no other reason than language, that a very large number of them were Jewish? The prisoners. A: Y-Yes. Q: Did you Œ do you recall how you felt about that? A: Well, I was angry learning of what™s happened, but I Œ I can™t Œ I can™t tell you my feelings at the time. It™s Œ Q: You said in your written testimony Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ that at a certain point, as you are advancing through the camp, you came to the crematoria. A: Oh, yes, yes. Here™s a picture of Œ of the oven. Q: Now, this is the one that you saw. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: And as I said, when my father had this bread route, and Œ and Œ and breads and challahs and so forth, I used to go to the bakery and they had ovens. That™s where Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 24they made the challahs and so forth. And when I saw this, it it Œ it made it Œ it brought me back to mind of the ov ens in Œ in the bakery. And so Œ Q: Did you understand when you saw that, what it was used for, and why it was being used? A: Oh yes, yes. Q: Was it physical obvious? A: I Œ I learned Œ I learned as we went in what was Œ what was happening, and what they Œ what did Œ the Germans had done. Q: And was it the prisoners who you we Œ that were telling you this information? A: I don™t recall. Q: Okay. A: I don™t recall. Q: Do you recall how long you spent inside the camp itself? A: I was there maybe just several hours. Q: Okay. A: As I said, at the time, we were still fighting in Œ in Œ in Œ where was that? In Œ in Œ in Austria. Anyway, no, we Œ we had to leave. But we left behind soldiers that would be doing what they had to do, clean-up and so forth. Q: Mm. But you were still in pursuit of the enemy, so had to move out. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 25A: Oh yeah, we were fight Œ we were fighting in Œ in a town in Œ in Œ in Austria now. What Œ if Œ if you want to take these papers Œ Q: Sure, of course. Thank you. Did that experience, this experience of being in the camp Œ A: Yes? Q: Œ after leaving the camp, you had to, as you say, go in pursuit of the enemy Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ who was in a full retreat. A: Yes. Q: Did it change your understanding of why you were fighting the war? Did it change that at all? A: No, we knew we had to fight the German s. I did learn of Œ of what they were doing to the Jews. Of course, I didn™t know at the end of the year Œ at the end of the Œ how many Jews were killed, and I wasn™t Œ I wasn™t happy with Œ with what I™d learned. Q: Of course not. As you™re pursing the enemy deeper into Austria, at some point, relatively soon, you get word that the war is over. How and when did that happen? A: While we were still in that town. We stayed there until the Œ the war was Œ then we got news of the war ending. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 26Q: Do you recall how that news was tran smitted? How did you learn that the war was over? A: I™m sure my adjutant, my commander learned of it, and I don™t know how. I guess word of mouth. Q: Were you excited, happy, or relieved to Œ how would you describe your emotions? A: My emotions were Œ I was very happy, but we had already Œ we felt that we had captured the enemy in Œ in Œ in Austria, and just Œ just biding there until the war ended. Q: How much longer did you spend in Europe after the war was over? A: I don™t recall. I think Œ I think our division went ba ck Œ you know, I don™t recall Œ the last I remember is being in the Œ in this town in Austria and telling that the war is over, but I don™t remember how we Œ how I got home. Whether we Œ we went to England Œ I don™t know, ma Œ maybe Œ Q: Sure Œ A: Œ maybe that tells us Œ Q: It™s quite all right. A: Œ I don Œ I don™t know. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim January 13, 2015 27Q: It™s quite all right if you don™t remember. Do you remember returning to the United States? A: Yes. Q: How did you feel? A: Very happy to get back. Q: Where did you come in, do you remember what port Œ what port did you come into? A: I think Baltimore Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ where we Œ Q: So Œ so home.
