Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 12A: The town Œ we had Œ the town was not big, but it was a 90 percent Jewish town, with a lot of youth. We had our own Bürgermeister , which means the mayor was a Jew, a very rich Jew. And we had a city hall, we had a jail. No hospitals, we had doctors, we had pharmacists, and of course a lot of merchants. Q: So, it was a large Jewish community. A: A large Jewish community, yes. Q: Within a small town, would that Œ or was it a city? A: Well, the town was not big, but yo u cannot consider a very small town. Q: Okay. A: We had three shuls. Q: Okay. A: In the three, we had a Œ the very Orthodox shul; we had the Conservative, more or less, shul; and we had Œ and the rabbis, of course, had their own shuls. There were four rabbis in our town. There were two brothers, and they had their own shuls, with their own people wh o went to them, just there. Q: Did Œ A: To pray, I mean. Q: Yeah. Did everybody know each other, or not really? Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 13A: Well, mostly like families know Œ knew each other, because the families stuck together, like my mother™s family was quite a large family, and my father™s family was quite a large family. I mean, they were not so large, like there were six, and in my mother™s family there were six. And they all had children there Œ not married, they were still all young before the war. Q: Mm-hm. A: I mean, married age came during the war. Q: That™s right. A: But before the war they were still all like 16 - 15 - 14 years old. So mostly Œ especially you Œ you knew very much your neighbors, because we were like close knit and living very close to each other. So Œ Q: Which parent were you closer to? A: Which grandparents? Q: Parent. Parent. Your mother or your father, who did you feel closer to? A: I think there were times when I was very close with my mother as a child. My father didn™t have time for anything, cause he was always, always working Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ in order to provide for the family. And then Œ well, this was before the war. Q: Yeah. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 14A: It changed differently later on. Q: Uh-huh, okay. I-Is that it changed during the war? A: I-It Œ it changed Œ in 1938 my father was drafted to the Polish army. Q: Yes. A: And everybody was very stunned becaus e already he Œ that time he was in the 40s, and he was like the only Jew who was drafted to the Polish army, and nobody could understand why. So of course it was very hard for my mother with the three of us to make a living, or support us. We went to my grandfather, to my father™s father. He had a big house, he had room for us, and he told us to come there. So we lived together until the war. Q: I see. A: And we didn™t hear from my father if he™s alive or not, where he is. He was fighting. When the war started, he had to fight with the Polish army, the Germans. Q: That was Œ must have been very frightening. A: It was very frightening and when they start to bomb the city, we all escaped like to a village, not far from Rozwadow , and then we came back. And we never went home again. And my mother stayed with us, with my grandfather, my grandmother had died just before, a few years. We stayed, and also my aunt and uncle. And their Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 15children all stayed at the same house until the Germans march into Poland , to our city. Q: I want to stop there. I still want to talk a little bit about pre-war. A: Yeah. Q: Do you have an earliest memory? A: Excuse me? Q: Do you have an earliest memory? Do you have, you know, as a child growing up, one of your Œ the earliest th ings that Œ that you can remember? A: I could Œ I could remember that antiSemitism started. I felt Œ not only I, the whole family, that short before the war, the antemitism(ph) got much more Œ Q: Strong? A: Œ intensive, you know, and it was scary to go out, especially at night, especially before a Christmas holiday, my father never let us out in the street, because the Polish people, they are very, very susceptible to drinking. And whoever they saw they could have beat up or something, and it was scary to go out. So this I remember very well when I got older a little bit, not when I was very young. When I was very young, I was like very free to roam around, not the city, but near the house. We had the little park, you know, we had swings. So it wasn™t like I had to Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 16go far away that™s my mother couldn™t call me in when she felt it™s time to get into the house. So Œ Q: So Œ A: Œ I was Œ I was a happy child. Q: Yeah. A: And had very good friends. Q: Can we stop for a minute? I™d Œ [break] A: So Œ Q: You were talking about some ve ry close friends that you had. A: Yeah, I had friends, we Œ we were very happy, you know. I remember I had a friend, she was rich, and they had the telephone in the house, and also a doll Œ a doll and a carriage. We all got together and play with her dolls and with the carriage. It was like, even for a person who didn™t make a living for the family, but you couldn™t afforded those th ings. So if somebody was able to afford it, well, they had the beer factory, that friend of mine. She didn™t survive the war. Q: What was her name? A: Excuse me? Q: What was her name? A: The name was Sandrovich (ph). Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 17Q: And her first name? A: I don™t remember. Q: Oh, okay. And Œ A: I don™t remember. Q: Did sh Œ A: Bronya(ph) Bronya (ph). Q: Bronya(ph) Bronya (ph). A: Bronya(ph) Sandrovich (ph), yeah. Q: Did you meet an Œ A: It™s coming back. Q: It does, it does. A: Yeah. Q: So Œ A: So we used to play in their backyard with the carriage, with the doll. And then one time it came to my home, we went home . But we looked forward the next time again to meet. But I had three friends. One you met on my picture. Q: What™s her name? A: Sonya Olst(ph). Q: Okay. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 18A: She Œ she™s now Œ she™s very, very, very sick. She has cancer all over, she™s a doctor herself, but she™s very, very sick, hardly surviving, I do n™t know how much longer she will survive. I speak to her once in a while. And we were close, we went always together, skating, to school, to Œ to public school, to Hebrew school. We were like three of us always, always together, never separating. And on Shabbas we used to go for Œ they had for the kids , they had like little lectures, you know, singing. And this was also gathering everyt hing on religious basis, nothing out of the ordinary, which didn™t belong to us. But there were also kids who were like in different organizations. And we always belonged to the Mizrachi . Q: Mizrachi . A: And the Mizrachi is a working religious organization, and mine brothers were also Œ my father made sure that™s my brothers that every Shabbas go to the meetings, and so some learning for the Polon (ph) Mizrachi , which is working religious people. Course my father belonged to that organization. Q: So that meant for Œ A: So as children, we were raised like Œ with love to Israel, and that time Palestine, but that no Œ we knew that eventually, maybe, one day we™ll go to Israel, that time Palestine. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 19Q: And so that sense, that Œ that mission, was something that was very conscious for you, as you were growing up, that Israel is a pla Œ is the homeland. A: Palestine. Q: That Palestine is the homeland. A: Yeah, my father was a Zionist. He always attended his meeti ngs, and he always intend that™s one day he™s gonna be in Israel. But he never made it. Q: Yeah. You Œ who were Œ what was the na me of your other friend, you had three of you. A: Yeah, the Olst(ph) family, they also were Œ when the Germans came in, we were living with them for a couple of weeks. And one da y they announced that we should get a Œ then the bomb stops, becau se they had already occupied them. Q: Okay, excuse me, I don™t want to get to the war yet. A: Okay. Q: We™ll get to the war. I wanted to know the name of the other girl. You were three of you who were all Œ A: Shifka(ph) rose Œ Shifka(ph) Wiesenfeld(ph). Q: Shifka(ph) Wiesenfeld(ph). A: Yeah. Q: And do you know what happened to her? Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 20A: Yes, they perished by the Germans. Q: I see. A: The whole family. Q: So it was the three of you Œ A: Separated, yeah. Q: Œ sep Œ yeah, who event Œ yeah, were se parated, but as children, you were the closest friends. A: Yes, we were separated as children when the war Œ when the Germans came into the town. Q: Okay. A: And they occupied. Q: I have one more question before we come to that. A: Mm-hm? Q: And that is about your relations with local Polish people. I know you mentioned that anti-Semitism got very strong right before the war, but Œ A: Yeah, only good relation we had is with the Œ our teacher. Q: I see. A: Polish lady. She was very nice to Œ to all the kids, and that™s the only Polish person that I really knew at home. We didn ™t associate with any Polacks at all. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 21Q: I see. A: Even in school, we had our own Œ our own Jewish kids which we play together during the recesses and mostly we kept to ourselves. Q: Okay. So now let™ s come to the war. A: Okay. Q: How much talk was there in your home about Hitler, about what was going on in Germany? A: Nothing. Nothing. Q: Nothing? A: Nothing. It was like Œ it was like a bomb, you know, like an Œ where they were bombing us first, like I said , we had Œ my mother took us, we escaped to a village, maybe there would be less bombing. But they were so low in the planes, that™s Œ I remember like vividly I seeing them now. They could have killed everybody, but somehow Œ Q: Were you on the road? A: We were on the road. Q: Okay. A: Trying to escape the city. But then when the bombing stopped, we came back. Q: Okay. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 22A: Not to our house, like I said, to my grandfather™s house, and we stayed there until the Germans moved in. Nobody talked about Hitler, nobody talked about the Germans. We only heard Œ nobody had the radio in those years Œ we heard that France was occupied, Belgium was occupied, all these countries, and Poland was like the next on the road. They came in, it was just before the Jewish holidays, and they settled themselves to the best houses, which they occupy half of my zayde™s house, my grandfather™s. Course, he had like a double house. And they were very Œ those were young, very young Austrian soldiers. They were quiet, pleasant. They said don™t worry, we™re not going to do no thing to you. That™s how I remember it. And it was settled, you know, everything is going to be okay. Few weeks later when they took my older brother to work, he was th at time already 14 years old. Q: Pinchus (ph). A: Outside the town, I don™t know what to do, I have no idea. Oh, maybe I had an idea, but I don™t remember. Then he came hom e at night a few days later, we heard the loudspeakers in the market, you know, it the city hall, that all the Jewish people should gather at this and this time in the marketplace, and there will be an announcement made. So the announcement was that every Jew has to leave Rozwadow immediately. You could go home, take whatever you can, and leave the town. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 23Q: What a shock. A: It was Œ for my mother it wasn™t a shock, because she wanted to go and find my father. She didn™t know where he is, she never Œ we never heard from him. She had a feeling that he is someplace alive. So she gathered us, we put on like Œ I remember like Œ I put on like three dresses, or whatever and two coats, and hats. It was already September, October, something like this. And my brothers, whatever they had in a little bundle on the back. And my zayde went, my grandfather, my father™s father. My cante(ph) with her three kids and her husband. We went to the San. The San is the river which divided our city in half. Q: Ah, so Rozwadow was on the San river. A: Rozwadow was on the San, yeah. Q: Okay. A: And that™s what Œ the city wh ere my husband comes, also on the San, but they were on the Ukrainian side, we were on the Galician side, on the Polish side. So Œ Q: Were the cities far from each other? A: Yes, yes. Q: [indecipherable] far? A: Yes, because they were like, near the Ukraine. Q: I see. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 24A: And we were near Œ and we were in middle of Poland , that called Irlitsia(ph) in that time. Q: Okay. A: It still Œ it still is called Irlitsia(ph). Q: Irlitsia(ph) A: Œ I think, I Œ I™m not sure. So everybody who was able to work, the kids, the old people, the young people, and some people didn™t leave. Some people were hiding in their homes. We left. We got on the San , hurry across the San. The bridge was already bombard to pieces. So, of course if you have a little money, my grandfather got a Polish guy who had a little, like a fishing boat or something. So the family got into that boat, and many people drowned, because they were walking in the water. They didn™t think it™s that deep, but it was deep. Many, many people drowned. And we got to the other side. On the other side we had a small village, but it was prosperous village, where my father™s brot her lived, his wife and his father-in-law and his child. Q: Wait, what was the name of the village? A: [indecipherable] I™ll tell you in a minute. Justkowicz (ph). Q: Justkowicz (ph). A: Justkowicz (ph), yeah.

They said yes, he™s alive, but he™s in the German side, in Premisz(ph). Q: Okay. A: Premisz(ph) was also, one side was the Russian, and one side also was the zerc Œ I mean, the water in the middle Œ one side was the Russians occupied, one side was the Germans.

A: The Germans got much faster to the other side where we lived. So my mother said no, she™s gonna take her children, a nd she™s gonna go and walk to meet the Russians. And we were constant, constant , we saw Polish Œ Polish soldiers coming back from the army, which were already, you know, army that time was already Œ Q: What did they look like, these soldiers, as they were coming back? A: Tired, exhausted. And they were glad that they still were alive and coming home. Q: Did they say anything of what happened? A: N-No, didn™t say nothing. We stayed in Pishnison(ph), which was the je Œ which were the border of the Germans, and the border of the Russians. Q: Okay. A: This was a cousin of my uncle. Q: Okay. A: She let us stay there in one room, all of us, my aunt with the three kids, an uncle, my grandfather and my Œ a nd us, my mother and three kids. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 27Q: Oh my gosh. A: Yeah. One very dark room, but at least, after walking for miles and miles and miles with the bundle and all dressed up, we finally got to Pishnison(ph), and we stayed there. The Russians were already occupied that town. We stayed there for awhile, maybe a week or something, til we got our strength back. My mother picked herself up, she left us with my aunt and uncle, and she took the [indecipherable] to Lwów , because she had a feeling that maybe she™ll find my father. Q: Was Lwów under the Germans at that point? A: No, Lwów was under the Russians. Q: Okay. A: Under the Russians. Q: Even though she had been told he was in a prison in a town Œ A: Yeah, but we don™t know what happen ed after. Q: That™s right. A: After the war, or Œ Q: Right. A: Œ how he got out or Œ Q: Right.

I don™t know how she had the courage to go there, and she was walking around the whole city, asking people if they ever saw my father, if they know where he is, and if this Œ if he survived. Somehow, my father survived. He was kept in a camp, in a German camp for a while, and I don™t know how he escaped, and he crossed the border to Lwów. Q: So even though she didn™t know, and he didn™t kno w, they ended up in the same city. A: In the same city, and somehow all the refugees at tho Œ at that time they all stuck together, they Œ everybody was trying to find some body they know. Q: Sounds like huge chaos. A: In Lwów, yes, little Œ in 1939, yes, 1940. And she found him. And she came back, she said to my Œ to his father, my zayde and Œ and to his sister, she said, I™m taking my kids, I™m going to Lwów , I found my husband. So we were so happy, and took the train, we went to Lwów and they gave us the Œ like a committee, a Jewish committee. There still was a lot of Œ lot of Jews before the war there. They arranged something for us to sleep in a Polish cathedral, you know, we slept Œ Q: Was it the first time you were in a Polish church Œ in a Catholic church?

So they found not fa r from the marketplace, a big house, which perl Œ probably belonged to Jews, and they gave out floors for those people. Q: Yeah. A: Now it was empty, we slept on the floors. So there was I don™t know how many families. We had a little space, all fi ve slept together and had the little [indecipherable] or whatever they gave us to cook something. And we lived there and I started Russian schools. Q: You started to go to school in r Œ had you s Œ ah, one question I had, did you see Russian soldiers in Lwów? A: Of course. Q: Okay. A: In Lwów.

A: I Œ I saw Œ I saw the German soldiers. They were much cleaner looking than the Russian soldiers. Different outfits, different everything. But they didn™t bother us, they let us roam around free. If you can buy something on the bl ack market, if you had some money for food or something, you bought whatever you could. And that™s how we survived for 1940 Œ 1939 - 1940. And I started Russian school. I was that time going in the Œ in the fifth grade, maybe sixth grade. Q: So how old were you? A: I was that time by 11. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 32Q: So you Œ as a Œ you were a young child when this is all happening to you. A: When the war broke out, I was nine years old. Q: Yeah.

I was only nine years old. What do I know about the war? Q: Of course, of course. A: What do I think about the war. Q: Yeah. A: So after my father decided in 1940, a lot of people decided that™s they going. There was a committee to register who wants to go back to Poland, to the Œ to home. Q: Af Œ I want to ask a question, though. A: Yeah. Q: When you started school and you Œ i-it was Russian school, so you™re starting to learn Russian, yes?

Q: Do you have any me mories of the school? A: Not much. Q: What would you remember from it? A: I remember to learn Russian that time. You know, beginning. They didn™t last long, maybe a few months. After my father went to register that™s he want to go back to Poland , not only him, they were standing in the line for days. And then he came home happy that™s Œ who knew the war is going to be for six years, nobody Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 34knew. That™s eventually they will let us go back to Poland, you know, to the home. So instead of keeping the promise that they™re gonna let us go home, the Russians took over. All the people who registered to go home, they got them together from all over, no matter where you were, and that was on a Friday night, I remember like now. My mother had cooked something for Shabbas. The Russians came in, because they knew where all the refugees were living, the Russians came in and they said, get yourself together immediatel y. We didn™t know what happened, we were sleeping. My parents woke us up, we got dressed. Then my mother took whatever she cooked, you know, for Shabbas, and they took us to the trains. Not knowing where we going, not knowing no thing. Hungry and naked and everybody get up like they know how to do it, very rough. Q: So the manner was different from what you had ac Œ been experiencing up til then? The way the soldiers behaved was different than what you had experienced in Lwów until that time. Q: Well, this was Œ this was like a Œ they Œ they had a Œ they were told they have to do that, but first, in one night they got together, the whole refugee or whoever Œ wherever they were, if they knew who they were. And when we came those trains, we met already my aunt, with her kids, and my uncle, and my grandfather and a lot of other families from other people my parents knew. And they put us in cattle Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 35trains, hundreds of people in one train. You only have standing place. We stood like Œ worse than cattles. And then the Ukrainian, the goyim, they were the happiest in the world. They were clapping and they were dancing, and they were whatnot. Q: You saw that? A: Yes, we saw that before we even went to the trains. So they Œ they kn ew they™ll have plenty of what to Œ you know, take away whate Œ whatever the Jews left. But they didn™t take the people who did not re gister. They only took the people who registered they want go back. Which means you wanted to go back to Œ to Germany, to be in that Œ on the Hitler side, but Hitler wasn™t, you know, on the other side of Poland . Q: But here™s a question. If Œ knowing that, knowing that Œ that it™s on the German side, why did your father want to go home? A: They didn™t think it™s gonna take Œ the war was Œ God knows they Œ they thought after the pact, you know, when the Œ Hitler did the pact with Russia, it™s gonna be one, two, three and they™re gon na divide, and you can go home and be yourself like you were before. That™s what you thought. Q: So they knew about the pact. They knew Œ A: Oh yeah, we knew about the pact, you know. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 36Q: You knew the pact. A: There never gonna be a war with Russia and Germany. They™re gonna divide whatever they took, and that™s how it™s gonna be finished. So who didn™t want to go home to their places where they were born, raised and Œ and worked and everything? So Œ and they took us to the cattle trains, and then they were filled up with different families, we didn™t know who they were. We didn™t know none of them. Q: Were any refugees not Jewish? Are you saying all of the refugees were Jewish? A: All Jewish. Q: All Jewish. A: All Jewish, only Jews. Q: Only Jews, okay. A: So Œ and we traveled, we traveled for a whole month. They stopped in certain places, which they let us go out in case you had to go out. Otherwise there was nothing inside that you could relieve y ourself. That was crying and crying and getting sick and it was Œ I™ll never forget that. We were only kids. My oldest brother was 15, my middle brother was 13 and I was 10. Q: You didn™t know where you were going? A: No. Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 37Q: You knew it wasn™t home, however. A: No, no, we knew right away, yeah, we knew it. Because it didn™t go the side like to Poland, it was now the way we going my Œ th ey used to stop like maybe after few weeks of traveling, or a week, so that people came to the Œ to the trains, and they gave us like [indecipherable] like hot water to bring something.

Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 38A: No, we Œ when we came to the Urals, it was already winter, because they took us off the train with sleds, and they brought us to Œ in the Urals, which was camps and barracks, and Œ and the steppes, you know, steppes? I don™t know if you know what the steppes are in Russia. Q: Tell me, what does it Œ what does it look like, a steppe? A: It™s fields, empty, empty fields, around, around on the Ural mountains.

So you didn™t know why you were there. A: They Œ no. We Œ we assumed, because mo stly people had registered to go back, and that™s why they were there, probably. Q: Okay, but no speeches, no explanation? A: Nothing, nothing. We came Œ the one of the cities, I think it was Molotov that time, which is like a main city in the Urals. I™m reading now a book about it also, from dur-during the war, and when I saw Molotov I rem Œ or Kora Stalowka (ph), this was a place where we were, the Œ the little enclave like a few barracks and on one side were the woods, with lions or with tigers and whatever.

They took us, after six weeks being in Czechoslovakia, they took us to Strasbourg in France , and Aguda they took to Cassada(ph), which is on the Interview with Go ldie Buch Jonas May 5, 2013 64Spanish border in France . And in France already, we had Madrafeme (ph), which were organizing the kids; the younger kids , the older kids, the middle kids. And we stayed in France from 1946 to 1948.
