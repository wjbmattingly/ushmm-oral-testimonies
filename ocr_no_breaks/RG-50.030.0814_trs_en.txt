Even I Œ when they took my father to Theresienstadt , 1942? Forty -two, yeah, when my sister was born, he was already no more home. Forty -two somew here, it™s in the papers, we have it. My mother, my sister and I, we went to Plauen . He had to report to the Gestapo. In between, he did forced labor, when he came home from Buchenwald .

Because they told me it™s still there, Augusta Levy . Q: I see. Ok ay. [break] So, we™ve Œ earlier we spoke about your life, about the complications that came with being from a mixed marriage. About the extraordinary strength, as well as youth, that your parents had, to endure everything. I™d like to ask you now, is there something you would want your grandchildren to know, and other people™s grandchildren to know, about that time that you lived through. A: I would like them to know that they would never go through their life, what we went through. And sh -should respect people for their beliefs, and what they are. They [indecipherable] e verybody for that. Because life is hard enough without all the complication. Q: Now the Œ you know, you mentioned through your story, something that I find very unique, which Œ unique in the degree of loyalty that your parents had one Œ to one another, when all the pressures were on them, particularly on your mother, to renounce your father. What would you want of the values that they passed onto you, that your children and grandchildren woul d also know about? A: First of all, I was very against mixed marriages. Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18, 2015 134 Q: You were? A: Oh yeah. It™s very hard, not on the two people who got married, it™s for the children. They don™t belong. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for them. But now we live in a new world, and I hope it never gonna happen again, because everybody™s bleeding the same way. Q: Well, that™s true. That™s true. Is there something in your story, and in your life, that you would like to share, that you forgot to tell us about? A: I™m not even think of it, what I can te Œ Q: That you think is important for us to know. A: I know it, but I would Œ I can™t think of it. I don™t know. It™s Œ I think my childhood, I Œ I could think it™s Œ was hard, but still, I like to remember it, because we all had each other, and we worked for the common goal, and we were very loyal to each other, what it™s very important. And especially, I give my mother the greatest respect, because she did not have to suffer like anybody, because she had a choice. But she did it, and my father and mother, happy. And she stayed a widow for 42 years. That™s how loyal she was to her father, even she was not accepted from the beginning, by her in -laws. And I admire that so much. I admire that loyalty, and I think we have it as such, most of our children, or her children, have all that loyalty. Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18, 2015 135 Q: So that™s something that she modeled for them, and showed for them, and they took as a Œ A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Œ their own value. A: Yeah, my Œ my Œ my one sister is married 60 years. My other one was married in the 40 years, because her husband passed away. Now, my brother is married over 50 years. My other brother just lost his wife, and my other brother married very late, he has a young wife. His children is only as old as my children. But that™s my youngest brother, so we all have that value that marriage is very important, and loyalty that we learned from my mother, and my father. Q: Of your siblings, your brothers and sisters Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ did you talk amongst one another after the war, about everything that you had gone through, about your unusual family, that you came from a mixed marriage, and so on? A: We Œ we didn™t talk as much, but we just say it is so very hard, how you grow up in that, and suddenly you live this way. Because we choose the Jewish way of life. And Œ but still, we cannot forget that we lived in a Christian world. It™s something Œ Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18, 2015 136 so when some holidays come around, you think about it. But, the celebration, it comes right down, we are Jewish. And our kids are j e Œ always Jewish. Q: And that™s for all the siblings? A: Wait a minute. No, the one doesn™t keep [indecipherable] but all of them, yeah. Q: That™s quite a lot, yeah. A: Yeah, my Œ my sister here, this one, she couldn™t [indecipherable] she Œ like I told you, she even went to the mikveh .

She had kids, and then she married a da Œ a doctor, and Œ and she™s a widow a long time, and she™s so young, and she™s not healthy. R eally not. But otherwise, we all doing pretty good. Q: And do the Œ does the younger generation Œ it clearly sounds that, from your family, that is, your husband and yourself, your children are interested in your stories. Interview with Edith Weinstein May 18, 2015 137 A: Oh yes, my Œ my children know. My Œ matter of fact, my one grandson took me my tape away, and he lives in New York , and he says, Grandma, could I have it? But Grandma never saw it again. So I let him have it. I says, what do I want to Œ I don™t know. So yes, and there a re Œ and like I gave you the paper, the one is like [indecipherable] she™s very active, and then the one went to Israel , and he wanted to stay there, but his father was Œ they™re all very Œ and Œ and here, the little one has. They™re all very interested in it. They™re Œ we instilled that life, and they™re not that religious, but they know they are Jewish, and where they come from.
