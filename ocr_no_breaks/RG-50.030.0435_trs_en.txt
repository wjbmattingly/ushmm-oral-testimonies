ITKA ZYGMUNTOWICZ May 30, 1996 Question: This is an interview with Itka Zygmuntowicz recorded on May 30, 1996. Tape one, side one. Answer: This is one of my poems th at I have written. It's called 'The Silent Voice'. It is dedicated to all those who's voices have be en silenced forever in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1 945. I wrote this poem May 11, 1980. When ages of civilization crumble to dust And death is raging supreme When the Devil is crowne d by the power of deceit Then freedom is a far away dream. When all that you love d is taken from you And you are stripped to the bare bone When all moral boundaries and laws are broken Then you are in Hell with Satan alone. When Jews are depicted as sub-human, as vermin And brute force and evil prevail When Nazi doctors turn children to corpses Then all logic and reason fails. When the whole world remains dead silent With the exceptio n of just a few Then they grant Satan license and opportunity To murder in the gas chambers a God-loving Jew. When man and woma n are kept apart And new life is not conceived When there is no soun d of laughter or song How can God by man be perceived? When mass murder of the Jews becomes legal Under the banner of an ideolo gy or God's sacred name Then its not the victims but the nazi murderers who did not resist Satan and defi le God's name. When living skeletons are marching at gunpoint Through the gate of Auschwitz in long columns of five, cold, st arved, forced to hard labor What power on earth gave them the strength to survive? When all heads are shaved , all human rights denied And all wear the same kind of __________ striped dress When to worship God becomes a crime Then the whole world is in a very terrible mess. When Hitler's dreams become a reality And the nazi's send Jews to the left and to the right Then such men are not ruled by God's divine power But by their own burning am bition for power and might. When the so-called superior Arian nazi race used all their knowledge, technology and skill To murder 6 million Jews merely for being born Jewish That I don't believe was God, but Hitler's demonic will. 2 That explains a lot to us. Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begi n by having you tell me your name , date of birth and where you were born, and a little bit about your family. And you might tell me your name now and your name at birth. A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz. I wa s named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in Poland. And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph). My family __________ use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I like to be called. I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating _________. I was the oldest of three siblings. I was bor n in a small town, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland, located about 90 kilometers north of Warsaw . At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our hometown, Chair-han-off (ph) Poland was about 15,000. A little less than half of that was Jewish. My family consisted at that time of my parents, ___________ Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, ___________ __ ____________. My ancestors on my mother's side came to Poland from Germany around the 16 th century. Four generations were still alive and each one had a lot of children because they came from an orthodox background. So my gr andmother was one of seven siblings. My mother was one of seven sib lings. My Aunt who live d also in Chair-han-off (ph) had also seven children. My other Uncle had three children. They all had, the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children. So we had a very large family. I feel that both my parents and my gran dmother were my first teachers and my first role models. I reme mber when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an extremely religious woman, observant woman, at home we only spoke Yiddish. We observed the Jewish laws, customs and traditio ns. And my grandmother was wear ing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish its called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes. For my grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life whic h effected the way she behaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us. And I remember that every morning when I would get up my grandmother would say with me th e prayers and in the evening she would say with me the prayers. She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity box, and she would tell me, "Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah (ph), our commandment." I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one coin from another, and a poor man came to our do or and asked my grandmother for alms. And my grandmother gave me some change , some coins, I had no idea th e value of it but I looked in my hand and I said, "Grandma, so mu ch money?" And my grandmother said, "My child, you only have what you give away." I questio ned my grandmother's proverb be cause I couldn't understand it, being so little, how can you give away something and still have it? So my grandma began with a smile and says, "Yit-cola (ph), I only give what G od and my parents have given me. I'm not giving mine." This is how she felt. And she taught me lots of Yiddish song s, told me lots of stories. I came from a family of st ory-tellers. And since, at that time, technology was not de veloped so much so, and my grandmother had lots of children. In fact, when Germany invaded Poland, my grandmother had five married children, 21 great -children and one great-g randchild. Only one granddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her na me was also Yit-cola (ph). I was eight years old when she emigrate d to Palestine in 1934, to get married w ith somebody who was, without her boyfriend, that she met also in Poland, Check-han-off (p h), who was from the same city, the same, and he left a lit tle earlier, so she went there to marry him. And I rememb er that the whole family was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, "God knows if we will see each other 3 again." And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), ______ ______ _ ________, don't cry. With God all things are possible." I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One. She lost a brother, she lost her husband, sh e lost two of her child ren, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter. But she neve r lost her unshakable faith in Go d. And she always believed and she never questioned. And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wo nderful role model for me. And she lived wi th us from the day I was born. And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to di e a natural death shortly after Germany invaded Poland. From early childho od on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of _________ ________, which in English means humanness. Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardst ick of ________ ________, they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they wo uld say, "Yit-cola (ph), its not ______ _______." I use to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that yardstick. You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve? But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me. And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift. But they were strict with me. When I was alre ady a school girl, I remember in Poland was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like _________ you know and th e kids didn't like it. So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too. So I remember that I aske d my parents, can I put on the knee socks? And they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too cold". And I was naughty and I fi gured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, __________ ________, so what di d I do? I went in and I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to school. My father often used to come to the school yard because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the dairy business, like wholesale dairy business, but he was with a partner and obviously I do n't know why, whether they, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing. So he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come home, or before he left, if I wasn't home, the school wasn't fa r to drop in and sometimes even br ing me some good ies or something, just to see me. So that particular morning, I went to school and it was recess and some of the kids started to say, "Yit-cola (ph), your father is here." And I didn't know what to do. I was wearing the knee socks. And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he said, "Yit-cola (ph), I feel very __________ and disappoi nted in you. Because everybody can make a mistake, but when a pe rson lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not ____________ and I'm very disappointed." An d I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me up and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll ne ver forget it, "Yit-cola (ph), everybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same. And in everything there is a lesson. So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping other people." The reason I am sharing this stor y is because I found out la ter when the Nazis came in, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you know how justice is important. I remember one time I was walk ing home from sch ool alone and a bunch of kids that I didn't kn ow, and who did not know me, a ttacked me both verbally and physically. I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punche s coming all over. And I couldn't, it was both the phys ical pain and the emotional beca use that was my first encounter with an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism. And I couldn't understand why. Why are they 4 so angry with me? Why do they hate me so much? I was too yo ung to understand it and I came home crying bitterly. Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was home. A nd she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?" You'll see later why those things are impor tant, because of the values. Q: So your mother as ked you what happened? A: What happened. I related to her the whole story. And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comf ort me. After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and sh e asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?" And I was shocked. I said, "Nothing." A nd my mother looked __________ _________, she said, "Well my child, then you have nothing to cry about. Your ___ ___ _______ does not de pend on how others treat you but on how you treat others." And I re member my family taught me that my _______ _______ does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date. Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame or held others because its not _________ __________. But they never taught me, what should I do when I am held, how should I respond? So what I used to do, I use to cry. Because I knew I cannot held anybody and I cannot , and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my spirit as long as I don't do something evil. As lo ng as I don't do somethin g wrong. So they actually very much stressed __________ ________, Yiddish _______, ________ __________. I received both, like I said at home we spoke Yiddish but in school we spoke Polish a nd I had also, I went to Bant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school. My little brother actually started at age three. My parents we re both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox. But in those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like beca use we observed al l the holidays, we had ____________ in our home, and we lived accordingly to th e Jewish teachings and customs and traditions. Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a shaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person. She had a beautiful voice and I remember s till how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs. Because before my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the Yiddish Theater. And at that time, the Yiddish Theater used to be the ________ ________, like a regular theater but they had that in the fire house, you know? Wh ere the firemen lived, so they would allow them there. But after she was married an d she had a family sh e would do it only for charity. So my parents very often used to take me to the theater and my mother belonged to a literary group. She was more, she was very artistic. If she would have had the opportunity then she would have done much more, but unfortunately. And I think that she instilled in me a love for literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of grandchildren and children. Excep t for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in 1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I never knew him. I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from England, London. Because that's where he married and he lived. So the whole family lived in Poland and we used to be a very close-kn it family. So we got to gether and because there was not, as I had mentioned before , technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used to, the family used to sit and tell stories, remini sce, you know? And every body thought that I don't even pay attention and I was just si tting in a corner and listen and ta ke in all these stories. Another time also that I heard a lot of st ories is that in Poland, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was only one Synagogue. But there wa s the ___________, like they call it, like the study house and a lot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other cities so they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would alwa ys bring home, in the Hebrew its 5 called ____________, or guests. And then there would be conve rsation at the table and they used to ask him questions and he would tell adventures and st ories. So it was, and one thing also, that after my mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother home, which was a great influence. I re member another story which also had a very great influence on me, is that we didn't have running wa ter or electricity in our home. And winter, to h eat the house, we cooked on an iron stove, and to heat the house it used to be a tile oven, which reached from the floor, most people in Poland had those, and they us ed to, they were able to open wells, you put the wood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this would be the source of heat, th at heated the house. So when they came on the holidays and ___________, they would sit around the oven and tell these stories. And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life. And I was always, when I star ted to go to school, one of my worst subjects was history. Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates, long ago, and a lot of places. But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea before the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects people. And I was a creative child. I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing this. And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished public school, that I going to continue to have more formal education, that I'm going to become a writer. Even as a young girl I used to write a lot. And I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father used to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, "Yit-cola (ph), recite a poem." And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems and I learned lots of songs, both at home. And another source of, I re member that it's almost funny, that there used to peop le who would go in the courtyard and sing and play inst ruments and some had wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money. So I remember once I was going home, it was on a Friday, I was going home from school. And those people played in our yard and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song. I caught most of it but not all the words fo r the first time, so I figured they probably w ill not sing it again in the same courtyard so I followed them. And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its Friday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly. And I remember I came home, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot (ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, "Yitcola (ph), quickly. Go in and wash up. Come to sha-bot (ph)." And I was so grateful that she didn't scream at me or anything. An d I remember the holidays and shabot (ph), but like I mentioned before, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every year, we observed Passover. And it was so differen t than it is now because every single object of the house was taken out in the courtyard. Dishes were ch anged. And at that time, I remember, we didn't have regular mattresses like today, we had so me burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put in the, they changed th e straw. And paint the house and wa sh every object. It was more for cleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual cleansing and I remember, the reas on why I speak about Passover, is because it is very, it is coincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the liberation. And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the _________, and we'r e talking about slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't understand this here. Because up until then, I was never starved. I never had any personal tragedy. My faith in God was not te sted, it wasn't a _______, and I couldn't understa nd all those things. And I remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that pe ople do not understand what we suffered because only somebody who suffered can, ma ybe they can understand but not the same 6 way. They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible illness then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the he althy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees li fe differently, and this is here. So, in my, it never entered my mind that one da y I will suffer like this here. That my people w ill suffer like this here. And I remember also another incident, its like I star ted to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our home, so we . . . Q: Let me just ask here, you didn't have these but that was normal? Yo u were fairly middle income? A: Yeah, that was not because we were of pove rty. This was because in the small __________, nobody in the small _______ ___ had it at that time. So, in fact, when I went now back to Poland, they still have, some people have outhouses and things, you know? But its so much more modern, its more ____________ in the larger city. But at that time it was common, you didn't know anything different because I rememb er, my Aunt lived, my mother's sister, lived in Warsaw. When my family took me I came home and told all my friends, I was excited, she had a toilet and you pulled the string from the ceiling and I said, "It was like a miracle to me." So it was because this was, I'm describing the world th e way I knew it and this all infl uenced, you know? Because when there was not water in the house, so we had a wate r carrier who would bring in water. We didn't have like today ready-made foods and, or you co uld go into the kosher butcher like today and buy a chicken. At that time we used to go to the ma rket which was the market place was the place where Jews and Gentiles had the most relations, was the most involved, because they would bring livestock, chickens, turkey and cows and they wo uld bring vegetable and fruits. The Jewish people would bring what they made, shoes and boots and clothes. So that was the exchange because that was the most time when Jewish people intermingled with the Gentiles. And so those things were, the life was different and it influenced different ly also. But going back now to the not having electricity, even though we didn't have electricity we had a light, fr om a nuft (ph) its called in Polish, petroleum, you know? Q: Kerosene? A: Kerosene, yes, I forgot the word, kerosene. So we had a kerosene lamp. And still we would always sit and read and it was very, education was ex tremely important. And so I remember that we didn't have a refrigerator. We didn't have all the m odern appliances because at that time nobody had them in our ___________. [end of side 1 of tape 1] So of course we didn't have any, we di dn't have electricity, we didn't have any refrigerator. And we used to store food in the root cellar. We called it root because, besides holding the perishable food we woul d put in there for the winter, so metimes my father would go to the country and buy like a whole sack of potatoes, carrots, onions, for the winter. And we also would keep there in the winter the perishable food, you know , when we cooked something. Sometimes when it was very cold, I remember my mother used to put it on the window sill, outside on the window sill, but mostly in the root cellar. So one time, in the root cellar it was dark. You had to, you opened, there was a square in the kitc hen floor with a ring, you pulled up the ring and there was a long ladder. It wasn't built in, it was put in, and you had to walk this, this ladder down, it was dark. A dirt floor. No windows. Cold. It smelled wo nderful with all the different kinds of vegetable things. But it was dark and I was, as I mentioned before, I was only 13 when the war broke out and this was earlier, so I was afraid to go down . And my mother noticed that I am afraid. She said, "Lit a candle." She gave me the candle to my hand, and she tell me, she waved to me, for me, and she said, "Go Yit-co la (ph), go. God is in the root cella r too." And I loved her, I trusted her, and I knew. I understood that if there would be danger for me she wouldn't send me because 7 she was very protective of me. In fact, I was never away one single day in my, until the Nazis came in, alone. I was always with the family. So I walked down a nd I brought up the butter. And afterwards I wasn't so afra id anymore of the dark root cellar. For two reasons. First of all, because I remembered my mother's words, "Go, Yit-cola (ph) , God is in the root ce llar." And secondly, for myself I thought, if I could do it once I can do it again. And so at home it was warm, it was a wonderful world. My grandmother was, like I mentioned, she would not permit me to take a bite of food without saying _________ _, which means a special prayer . And always stressed the importance. Yiddish guide, the mental guide to her was _______ ___. And anothe r thing which I do really appreciate a lot about my grandmother is, that whenever I did for her a little added. She never took me for granted. Sh e would many times over say, "Oh my __________, God Bless you and thank you", and she would make me feel so good. And one time I said, "Grandma, its just a little thing." I didn't call her grandma, I called her ___________, ___________ for grandmother. And I said, "It's just a little thing." And my grandmother would smile and she would say, she always, when I asked her something she had such a beautiful, warm sm ile, she said, "Yes my child. But kindness and caring are not little things." And the reason why the _________ is later I found out how much those values helped to shape me. And also of cour se there was the influence from friends. In fact, I used to have one friend becaus e where we lived, we lived at two addresses. I was born in one house an d then we moved. And the first house, the entrance was fr om the back and I remember like today, ther e was a huge field and I us ed to play there. And one of my girlfriends was a Polish little girl, her name was Helenka (ph). I cannot remember any longer the last name, but we used to play a lot together. An d I remember that she used to co me like in the morning when it snowed, winters were cold, so I don't know how its called in English but I would go out and lay down on the snow and make a Q: An angel? A: An angel, you know? And with Helenka (ph) we would, you know? A nd then I remember like today, I was always very happy child and I was playing. And I remember when I was little and I went to the field and I felt such a sense of __________, so I would flop my hands like a feldas (ph) and pretend that I'm a bird and fly. And later, it ne ver entered my mind that one day all this going to be gone. That I will not have this anymore. And then, everything all of a sudden changed when the Nazis came in. Q: You mentione d this Polish girl . Did you have other friends or other neighbors who were not Jewish? A: We, there were not too man y, not too many. We had some non-Jewish, and we had a good relationship to them. Actually, I personally, the only serious incident of anti-Semitism was when I was walking home. And another thing which also, but that was not, it was verbal, it was not attacked. I once heard a non-Jewish child saying to me, "The houses are y ours but the streets are ours." And at that time it didn't reflect, but I could, also when I was thin king about it I said, "What do you mean? My family lives here already for, my ancestors came here in the 1600's. We are citizens. We do everything. And yet, we're not looked as equals?" You know, you sense a little bit. But I personally didn't sense it so much. I knew more about it from goi ng to Hebrew school, knowing about the poems from my gran dmother and my parents, use to tell how it was. I also knew good things also about some neighbors, but we had pretty decent relationships . It wasn't at that time, but that was after like, af ter Pew-suit-ski (ph), Mal-shall-vic Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, things started to change. And you know, we were not treated, we were treated like second-class citizens in many ways because when we wanted to go to higher studies, it started like a few years before the Holocaust, you couldn't go, Jewish people couldn't go to the unive rsity, we were not allowed. 8 Q: What year are you talking? A: What year? I would say like in 1937 or 1938 it started to get a little more because I don't remember the exact year that Pew-suit-ski (ph) died, but things were a lot better. Though the government officially didn't have any law against Jews, or sanctions, but there were many types of things I remember from the stories that I heard, the family tell and from other people, and from history. That I know that the Jewish people were, we were on the _____________. Q: Did you know about, or did your family talk about, wh at was happening in Germany prior to 1939? Did you know who Hitler was? A: At the time? No. I didn't know much of politics, ye s. I was like I said a creative child. I was more interested in writing and in playing with the kids and doing art work a nd singing, I loved to sing since I was a child. And my mother taught me, not just my mother but both my parents because they used to ta ke me to the theater, many songs and things. Q: So your family didn't talk about wh at was happening in neighboring Germany? A: Maybe they talked but I don't remember this in particular. That didn't, you know, like I said, I was only 13 years old when the war broke out. An d another thing when I was a child, here a 13 year old child knows a lot about her body, knows, you know? Beca use I wasn't brought up in the environment and my grandmother was so orthod ox, so it was more modest and you didn't know much about sex, you know? And we didn't talk too much about those things at that time. And I remember that in our city there was a girl, her name was Rosa L oberta (ph) and she was a leader from __________ _________ __. And because some of my frie nds who were somewhat older along there, to tell you the truth, I knew it™s a Zionistic organization. I didn't understand yet exactly the, I didn't know too much about politics to be very honest with you. So I wanted to belong too. And in Poland everybody belongs to orthod ox, to some different organizati ons, but practically everybody belonged to the organizations, so I wanted to belong to ________ ___ ___________. And I remember she took me to one meet ing and Rosa Loberta (ph) was th ere and I met her and I said to her, "Rosa, I would like to belong to the meeting." And this was about a year before the Nazis came in. And she said, "Yit-cola (p h), you have to wait __________ _____ because it starts from ______________." And when ___________ came I no longer could do it. And later, I don't know if you know about Rosa Loberta (ph), she was . . . Q: Did she impress you at the time? A: Yes. She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader. Very, very much for Israel. Sh e was very much involved in Zion ist and she was hoping that, very much involved. You know, the olde r children, because I was ______ ___ and I think because of my grandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all other influence from my parents who took me to the the aters, who took me to Jewish plays and every summer we would go to th e country and ________ ____, cousins, from Warsaw, because I had cousins there, I had ________ ___ cousins, the ____ ___________, so we w ould get together. And I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very affectionate, she was very warm. And I remember , I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also made a great influen ce, that she instilled in me a love for literature and fo r singing and everything. Is that when we lived in Poland, we didn't have closets like we have now. We had what they called a French amour' (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the floor to the ceiling and it had two doors. Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was us ed for the wardrobe, and the left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandm other's and my mother's, hats lying there. And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was always locked, this side of the wardrobe. And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I 9 used to try to play all kinds of games to try to gu ess what is in that chest. And I used to think, maybe a treasure, mayb e a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to thin k that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know th at I am adopted and they are hidi ng the papers. It was a whole source of curiosity for me. And I remember one day my mother sa id, "Yit-cola (ph), please come. Come here. I want to show you something." She took out the key and she opene d the chest. And I had like two kinds of emotions. In one way, I was burning with curios ity to see what is in the chest that was constantly closed. And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there? What is there? And she opened the chest and she said, "Look Yit-cola (ph)." And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books. And she took out a book, point ed to the closet, she said, "Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds. You can sit right here in Chair-hon-off (p h), you will see the world throug h great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world." And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read. And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward. And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mo ther never read to me little children's stories, sh e started with this grown up stuff. And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by _______________ ______________, a Yiddish writer, it was called _____________ _____________, Buncho s (ph) of the Silent. I reme mber many stories, but this story I'm relating to you because I've been thinki ng about it most of th e time when I was in Auschwitz. And the story is ab out a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos (ph), ___________ ___________ which means silent. And this man, when he was a little child, lost his mother and became an orphan, only had his fath er. At the age of 13, the father remarried and took a very cruel woman who abused the little boy. She would eat well but she would starve him. She made him chop wood barefoot in the winter. He never had a new chan ge of clothes. They didn't send him to school. Didn't ha ve a friend. But no matter what she, he was co nstantly lonely, but he never complained, not even to his father. And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a drunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair. He picked himself up and he left and he was going from place to place. He wandered into a big city and for no reason known to him he was put in jail. And then he was, for th e same unknown reason to him, he was let go. But he was still silent. Never complained. Then the story relates how he suffered also, starvation, looking for job, a nd worse than the job was looking for th e job, and then people wouldn't pay him. He wa s constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent. And then he married a woman who already ha d a child. And it was a little boy, a baby. An d she left him with the child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 y ears old, he threw him out from the house. But Buncho (ph) was again silent. And it relates the whole story, a beauti ful story. It kept me so in suspense. I remember it today. Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read well, I read many of the books whic h my mother had in that chest. And the reason why she kept it locked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little ch ildren might damage her books. Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it. But its just the values that she had. So this man was constantly abused and la ter somebody run him over with a horse and wagon. And even in the hospital where people are allowed to complain, he was still silent. And in silence he lived and in silence he died. And after he was buried they put a piece of wood and a marker on his grave and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife found it and used it to light the, to heat the stove. So he didn't ev en have a grave or anything. And then, but it was different, the write r says, in the other world, the worl d where there is justice. And when he came up, they told him, "Buncho (ph), here in heaven everyt hing is yours. Whatever you want. Pick, choose." And he couldn't believe it. Why would somebody be so good to him in the 10 other world where they were so cruel to him her e? And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain. Not to man, not to God, never, he was en vious that somebody had more. So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?" And he couldn't believe it. And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for br eakfast a hot roll with butter." And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent. He had no choice. And al so, what would we give for a piece of bread. So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this st ory, is that Paris (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has be come a Yiddish classic. This book is in English still and its beautiful. I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty. And when he says here that they look, why was he silent? He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out. But when the Nazi s came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent. When Germany invaded Poland, the first thing of the hometown, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other ho use already. And our house was strict _____________, which was near Warsaw Street, whic h was the main street. And as soon as we came out, this was almost in the corner, was a large house and they had a cellar, they had like big cellars. So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding. And even there, sitting there, my mother tried to calm us down with telling us stories. She was such a wonderful story-teller and she knew so much literature and so many plays. And then, when they just came in, we were still allowed to move from place to place, so people started to ru n. People from Warsaw came to small towns. Other people came to different places. And my father's entire fa mily, his sisters, three sisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and my father was born in Pull-tos (ph), Poland. So they still lived with the children and, I think, their nieces and nephews, they lived in Pull-tos (ph). And we didn't know what's happ ened to them because, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conv ersation between my parents, he said, "Let's go to Pull-tos (ph). My sisters are gone." Because both parents, like, I never knew my grandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of them. But we didn't know, we didn 't go. And then, when they to ok Warsaw, we could no longer go from place to place. That's when the Na zis begun their systematic destruction. Q: Did the Germans come into your town? Were there bombings? Did the soldiers actually come in? A: The soldiers came in. There was bombing. And, I just told you, we went into hiding. And then when the bombing stopped, I'll tell you what my grandmother did. It's almost ironic. My grandmother lived through World War One, so sh e remembered a differen t kind of Germany. Because she remembered a Germ any not at war against civilian people, women and children especially targets, and Jewish peop le. So she baked a cake and sh e said, "Yit-cola (ph), take it out to the poor soldiers that are away from home." She was a ve ry compassionate woman. She had nothing to do with political _____ ____, and she asked me to bring it ou t. So later when they, I think it was towards the end of, they came in Octobe r, I mean September 1, 1939. At that time was about 3,300,000 Jews in Polan d. Ninety-percent have perished. And most of those, the ten percent who survived, mostly survived in the USSR Because there were no ghettos. There was no concentration, no gas chambers, you know, concen tration camps with gas chambers. They also have suffered. Q: Okay, tell me your story. A: So, anyhow. When the Nazis came in to the other cities, that was the last time that I saw my relatives. All the other relatives that lived in the other towns because we could no longer travel from place to place. They star ted by taking up the spiritual and the community leaders, the 11 intelligencia (ph). Some Polish people too. And they took them away some, they shot, the ones they took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witn ess for what I saw. And they started to destroy the Synago gues, the Holy Scriptures. They confiscated all ou r businesses. We didn't have, in Check-hon-off (p h) a business. My father was, like I said, I told you before. And they started to put on curfews. We were not allowed to congregate in large groups. I could no longer, we could no longer go to school, all schools were closed. All social Temples were closed. We had to wear a yellow star. We were not allowed to walk on the pavement, just in the street. And we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened. Everyday they made new laws. And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws because they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding. Q: How soon did this ha ppen after they came in? A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books. I told you, my mother valued so much book and its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Hol y, all the books that was from the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and a ll the books from the Synagogue, in the Synagogue, they burned down everything. So they starte d to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not allowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ___________, which is you have to have 10 pe ople to have for the prayers. So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most . They started to, wh en they saw elderly me n, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did. So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard. They started to torture, to mock. Because to, they did whatev er they wanted. They had all legal rights to do those things. And then they confiscated the busi ness, they looted the merchandise. They started to ration the food and started starvation. And also we had to, they would grab people to do th e work in the street. And after a whole day's work, they would come home and w ould have to stay in long lines to get a small ration, a very small ration. So right away we started to starve. Couldn' t go to school. And in other __________ country the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up. But you couldn't. So that's when I was thinking a lot abou t starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent. That we had to be silent, you know, in order to surviv e. And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother. They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor. So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was ____________ because they singled us out as an inferior race. And we were not allowed to have any transactions, not business, not social, not sexual , because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would happen, it would be punished. And we had a big _________ and one time a man, a civilian, until this day I don't know his name, but I reme mber the incident ve ry clearly because I was also involved in it. A man came in and he was selling household articles. Since people, most people gave up the money because they didn't want to ris k, if they are caught for whatever you did against the law, it was punishable by death. And even with out any reason they shot and they killed and they tortured. But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked. And one man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph). He was the owner of the building where I went to school. And he walked by too and he came in. And my mother all of a sudden realized that if somebody is going to see us standing and having any business transactio n with somebody who is not Jewish, and we didn't know wh ether he was Polish or whethe r he was German, because there was a lot of __________ __ ________, that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live in Poland. So she said, she was afraid, so she said, "Please come into my house." She invited everybody. And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money. So he 12 bought maybe 90 percent of the me rchandise. My mother didn't bu y anything. We gave up the merchandise, you know? Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but befo re we came to the ghetto I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled th is out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them , so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or what ever. But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who wa s selling the merchandise. But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our hous e and denounced my mother. An d they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he to ld us." And that is th e first time in my life that I heard my mother lie. She said she didn't know. But she did know who he was. He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we kn ew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to school there. So after . . . End of Tape 1. 13 Tape 2 A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our house and they interrogated my mother. They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was. And, I' m not sure whether I mentioned this , that this was the first time I heard my mother lying. That she sa id she didn't know, she denied it. So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything. They took her away. The Gestapo took her away. I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured. So I was afraid to be separated from my mother. So I run after her. And I was determin ed, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone. So they kept on chasing me aw ay. And finally, one of them said, "Take her too." And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her. And they brought us to the Gestapo, the station, and they separated us. They took my mother in to a separa te room. This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness. And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her a nd she was screaming. Th e shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent. That's when my heart al most stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive. But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious. And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the doors swung open. Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, draggi ng her across the floor. And to ok me in, to be next. And I wanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she is still alive. So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same place. And she didn't say anything, but sh e gave me a sign not to say anyt hing. And I l oved my mother because she always loved me so mu ch and I knew what kind of a pe rson she was. So I was, when they started to ask me questions I said, "I don't know it." I lied too. Deliberately. And they started to beat me and I was screaming, a nd my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything. And after I was beaten quite well, th ey, because we spoke Yiddish at home, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin -nook (ph)". Enough . _______ _________ _________ _________, which means maybe we don™t know. Maybe _______ we don't know. And that's when they released us. This story beg un in 1939, shortly after Ge rmany invaded Poland. I didn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph). I di dn't know what's happen ed to him. At that time, the Nazis used all kinds of techniques. Th ey reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws. We, in Judaism, in home and in Hebrew school, they taught us that we ar e all responsible for one another. What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all. Group punishment for individual action. So, and ironically, what was legall y ours they took away by force and we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it. So I didn't know what's happened to the Cal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we w ould have told they would have killed the whole family , not just the father. And I'm going to stop here because I don't want to lose the end of this st ory because this story had a tremendous impact on me. And I'm going to skip and come back later to 1939. I'm going now to 1981 when I went to th e world gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors, okay? Q: Okay. A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people be fore I left that they wanted me to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a doc umentary. And I told them that story. Anyhow, when we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us got a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygm untowicz USA. That was all. And as I was 14 standing, this was the last date when we were marched into the courtyard, you know? And Menachem Bacon was the President there. And I was overwhelmed with em otion to think from the gates of Auschwitz, to come now to the gates of Jerusalem and af ter so many, more than 2,000 years, to have our homeland, a nd then I understood already what it means to have our homeland, then people cannot tell you, "The houses ar e yours but the streets are ours." And I was overwhelmed. And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew, but they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask questions. And as the people are ma rching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself, "Can I have a marker or a pen?" And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (p h), Check-hon-off (ph), Poland and Auschwitz. I figured in case somebody recognized, y ou know, walks by, they do not recognize me. I was 13 when th e war broke out and now I am an adult. My name has changed. Who will know me? And as I st and there, Kentel Vee-che-nya (ph) from Lindstrom, Pennsylvania (ph) was bringing the American flag as a gift to Menachem Bacon. And he looked at my badge, he said, "You're from Chair-h on-off (ph)?" And I said, "Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph)." And with him walked another man and he said, "I'm from Chair-h on-off (ph) too." And I said, "Who are you?" And he said, "Cal-hus (ph)." And I went berserk. I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited and he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, "Ask him for the address." So I asked hi m for the address and before he gave __________ I said, "Are you the son or the father?" Because he looked too young to be the father. He said, "I'm Cal-hus's (ph) son." And he gave us a card, he lives in Natan-a lia (ph), Israel because after the war he went to Israel, and he married an IsraeliJewish ________. And we went th ere to interview him too. And I found out his father, unfortunately, died in Ausc hwitz, was murdered in Auschwitz. But he and another brother survived. And both are married a nd have children and grandchildren. And that's when I was understood, my grandmot her's saying, that you only ha ve what you give away. And that you don™t have to be rich or famous an d you can give away ______, good deed and your _______ ________, and three generations. When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice. And that's when I learned spiritual resistance, from my mother. And I learned what ________ _________ is. What to do with humanness. And now you underst and why I was sharing with you the lessons, what my mother said. ________ _________ doesn't de pend, and then I'm going back to 1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know. Actually, Cal-fus (ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion. They took him and made him a part of the, you know, the interv iew. Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939. After they took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions. In the meantime, my grandmother died. That was before we went to the ghetto. My grandmother was no longer alive. And I was heartbroken because, ex cept for my parents, I have never had as a close relationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my gr andmother. And she had such a great influence in this, I was heartbroken. But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to go to what we went through and sh e died in her own bed and she wa s buried in Chair-hon-off (ph) and is there still. That was already, it was not as open, another kind of funeral that would be otherwise. Q: I wanted to ask, in this period where the Synagogue was burned , you weren't allowed to go to school, there were all kinds of rest rictions. Did you pray at home? Did you try to continue to . . .? A: Yes, yes. I still said every, in fact, even today, so many years, I still have the _________________, it's like in-bred in me. Because I said it every morn ing when I was a child. And then, it just . . . Q: Were you able to try to observe holidays and things like that? 15 A: We couldn't observe holidays anym ore because, first of all, Jews were not allowed often to pray or to go among the Synagogues. We couldn't make a traditional sha-but (ph), there was no food. We lived in constant fear . And I saw, for instance, I think that I mentioned it, th e religious people suffered more because th ey couldn't often _____________ and th ere was starvation. When you, we tried as much as we could. I still knew what day it is and we tried as much as we could to keep the sha-but (ph), but that was when we were still living in Chair-hon-off (ph). An d I actually didn't say good-bye to any of my relatives. Only, from all the family, from all the members, the only person on my mother's side that I said good-bye was to my grandmother. Because my moth er and I was at her bed side when she di ed. And she was clear, her mind was so clear. And I reme mber that I was terribly upset and my mother said something that also was to be a lesson. She said, "Yit-cola (ph), (she said that in Yiddish, of course, because as I said I spoke Yiddish), death teaches us not to take for granted life." And we still had, usually you know, according to tradition, the Jewish burial was very important. But later we co uldn't have, people couldn't ultima tely go and bury so we still, she was still buried in Chair-hon-off (ph). Q: You were able to bury her properly? A: We did, we were able to bury her properly but it was not like a big funeral that she would have had because the children from Wa rsaw, the children from __________ and all of them, they couldn't come. We just, our family, and the people who were involved. Because from everything, from birth to death, our lives was differ ent than it is now, how it was during the Holocaust. Because, for instance, there was not funeral pyres. There was not , you didn't bury people the same way that is here. And everything was differe nt, on the way the customs were do ne. Our whole lives changed. Before the Nazis came in, the longest that I ever didn't eat was from one me al to the other. And being that we have a kosher home and familiar, after meat, eating, you wait six hours. So the religion taught me a lot of discipline too. And later the people who kept kosher could not keep kosher, they didn't have food at al l. They were starving. So then in the middle of the night . . . Q: Did you break thos e rules? Did you eat whatev er you could at that point? A: At that point there was no meat . There was no meat and we tried as much to keep as we could. But eventually when the hunger to ol over you no longer could do it anymore because I remember a young pupil once of a Rabbi, when I was in Chair-hon-off (ph). Some body was sick so he said that you're allowed, you don't have to fa st if you don't feel good becaus e to preserve your health, that was the first obligation. So all th e laws, all the rules that applied before into othe r times that no longer could be applied here. Because here was ju st one thing, survival. Q: How long were you able to live i n your own home? A: This is where I'm coming to now. I remember exac tly. It was in the mi ddle of the night. October 15, 1941. We were asleep and we heard, they broke in, th e middle of the night. "All youden rouse." All Jews out. And at that point we only, we couldn 't, you wake up and you are tired, oh, the first thing with my mother, grab what she wa s mostly interested of c ourse, the family should get out alive. She took the candlesticks, books, her books. A few books and a couple of bundles because everybody was constantly ha ving, like a few things, we didn't know from day to day. And we didn't know, where are they taki ng us? And when I wa s a child, we use to, I use to play a lot at, you know they have, ________ it was called, a river. I' m trying to, is this a river or a lake? Which is larger? A lake? A river. A lake is larger, I think, but this wa s a river. And in th is river, we used to play as children, I use to go, and there were big trees. In fact, I remember a story when I talk about the river and, I don't know, should I tell it? Which is reall y, okay. But anyhow, since people in this river, people used to bathe and there wa s like a special, like a place where on sha-but (ph) we used to go, ___________ they use to call it, you know, to go for a walk. And we would go to the 16 river. And had beautiful moments. And then was a big castle near the river, there was a castle. When I lived there, it was empty, nobo dy lived in there. But a beautiful castle. In fact, I was now in Poland, it's still there, the castle is still there. I have a photograph of it. S o, in the middle of the night, "All you-den rouse." With do gs, rifles, and they chased us ou t and they took us to the castle near the river. Lee-din-ya (ph) was called the river. And from there they pu t us on trucks and they took us to the ghetto, Nove' Mesto, Poland. Q: Now who was with you at this place? Your entire immediate family? A: My parents, my little brother and my little sister. That was all. My Aunt and Uncle and their children, they were the only ones that I saw still in the beginning, but when they chased us out they were not with us. So like I said, the only person th at I said good-bye was my grandmother. The rest of the family we didn't know because to the other cities we couldn't even go , but them we would see occasionally. But when th ey chased us out, not until after the war I found out that wh en they chased us out they didn't chase out the whole city, they just chased out part. I don't know whether it was the larger or the smaller but the rest they chased out later, so my Aunt must have been, and her family with them. Q: Did you have any sense of wh y you were chosen to go at th at point verses another family? A: I didn't even know that we were, that somebo dy was left. Because they chased us out in the middle of the night. We didn't have a chance to talk to anybo dy. Not until after the war did I find this out. Q: So they sent you to this other town? A: They sent us to other town which was called Nove' Mesto, they change d the names, everything was changed. And Nove' Mesto, where previously lived one famil y, they put in six, seven and eight families. And the ghetto, you know, I don't have to explain to you what a ghetto is, we were isolated from the whole city. A nd it was so terribly crowded. A nd there, where we lived in was a family, the family which lived there was called Yat-rack (ph), and when we came there the facilities were not much better, like in ours. And so many families with little childr en, and everybody wanted to be able to go to the stove or use the faciliti es and everything. So, it was already horrible just being so crowded. And one time, my mother and father said to us , "Kindle-left (p h) children, get together the few belongings, we are leaving." And I thought to myself, are they loosing, have they lost their minds? Where are we le aving? It's a ghetto. We cann ot go out. But we were, knew to respect our parents so we obeyed. And we went to a place where was before a storage for grains. And it was empty, it was a dirt floor and nothing th ere, just a small window and a door. And my parents went, there were many ruins and they got together some bric ks and by themselves they built a little stove. But what they said is still clear and vivid in my mind. They said, "At least here we'll have, it's enough that the Nazis dest roy us from the outside. Here at least we'll have a little bit more peace and we'll be together . But it won't be because the fighting, the screaming, the children crying. So we'll live there, right here, in this storage ro om." Exactly, and the co nditions of the ghetto, I don't think I need to go in because its very clear at this point. Q: Well how bad was it? I mean, there are ma ny kinds of ghettos. A: Okay. This ghetto, to my knowledge, was not like the Warsaw ghetto where there was physical resistance, of fighting. In fact , there was some ghetto, it was not as large a ghetto. What I remember is that we were constantly hungry. And my mother tried from the little meal that we had, she tried to make meals and many times what she did, she would take a little of hers, she would give to the smaller children because they couldn't endure so much. We wanted the parents, if the parents wanted to protect the children, she still was trying to read poetry and to sing songs, she still had the books, and she says, "We must, as long as we live, we must go on like a cloc k. We cannot stop. 17 We have to go on." And she tried to teach my little sister who didn 't have a chance to go to school, so she tries to teach her at home , _________ and to write a little bi t. And my brother never had a chance to become barmitzvah. I do n't know the exact age of them but I know th at before, that he was not yet barmitzvah. And barmitzvah was alwa ys a very, very important thing for a Jewish child. So we lived in constant, and there was a lot of sicknesses. Because the sanitary, there was no medication, there wasn't a sanitary. A lot of parents died. You saw little orphaned children in the street begging for food. It was just horrible. Why I don't go in so much detail from the ghetto, because remember like I said before, that each time we thought it's the worst, something worse came. So after Auschwitz, this was like paradise. And for the main reas on, because I still had my family. Q: Okay, but then let me ask you a few questions. A: Okay. Q: Because we know a lot more ab out some of the larger ghettos, but I don't know too much about this one. Was there an organizat ion within it? Was there a yudde n-rot (ph)? Where there Jewish policemen? Or did the Germans patrol the ghetto? A: The Germans patrolled, I don't know why I don't have so much knowledge of how it was in the ghetto. Because I know one thing, that most of the time we stayed inside so much. I know there was a lot of sickness. I kn ow that they tried to help, there were people who tried to help each other. But the problem is that everybody was starved. Everybody was hungr y. You couldn't go, it's just that sometimes the parents like made sacrifices. Th ey would give a little of their ration to a younger child and the starvation. The kids couldn't anymor e go to school. But if they would discover that we teach the children, we could be shot. They didn't want us to be educated. They wanted to destroy everything else. So still, the parents tried to teach and there were groups and we tried, like there was a group and if somebody got sick they tried to help. But the exact conditions that I should remember so clearly, I don't rememb er. I didn't know, I was too yo ung still to know everything. Q: So you didn't know how it was organized or run? A: No. Q: Was there a soup kitchen? Do you remember that? A: I don't. No, I don't. Q: It's okay. If you don't mind, ask you a few questions. A: No, no, you can ask me. But I don't know. I know that, yeah, there must have been a soup kitchen because I remember that we used to go to get some food, because we didn 't have the food at home. We got rations. But I don't remember ex actly how it was organized. Q: Did people work in the ghetto ? Did either of your parents, were they forced to work? A: I don™t think too much, no. Q: Okay. Did you play with other children? A: Yes. In fact, there was one girl that I got to know in the ghetto. We stayed friends. So yes, I did have friends, tried to as much as we could to go on and to talk, but the cond itions were so horrible. Because hunger and no place to wash, no place to, if somebody got sick there was no medication. So there was a lot of illne sses, like typhus was a lot, also, goi ng in. Some people died of starvation. Some people died, that's what I remember most, is little kids crying a lot and begging. And older people sitting outside because there is already a lot of orphans. Q: Were bodies burie d when people died? A: This I don't know. Q: Did you, were you able to sort of, you were, wa s the ghetto fenced in? Were you able to go out of it? 18 A: Yes. Yes, it was fenced in. Q: But you could wander freely on the streets in the ghetto? A: In the ghetto, people tried not to wander around too much beca use they didn't want to, they wanted to avoid to be visible. Not to get hit be cause the Nazis had a tendency to torture, to mock us. In fact, for that reason, we tr ied as much to stay out of sight . I remember that I was mostly trying to be inside, like I felt safer to be inside. Q: Did the Nazis come in to the ghetto? Do you remember seeing people in uniform inside the ghetto? A: Yes. But not constantly. I don't know why I have so little recollection of the ghetto. That is not too much, I was a whole year in th e ghetto. It was exactly October 15, 1941. They chased us from home. And the ghetto, the entire gh etto was liquidated on November 17, 1942. About a year later. What I remember is that when, again in the middle of the nigh t, I don't know wh y, but when we were chased off it was in the middl e of the night. But this time we were told, they got us all together, and we were told that we're going to be resettled to a fami ly camp where we are going to have better conditions. Where we are going to have food and medications and where the families are going to be together and work . And people were happy that we 're going to have better medical conditions and better food. And then they took us all and they put us in the cattle cars. I still had . . . Q: How did you get this information? A: From the __________ b ecause I went there too. Q: No, how did you get th e information that you were going to be moved supposedly to these family camps? A: Because a Nazi say this. Q: So they came and they told you that? A: They told us that we are going to be resettled to a family camp and we are going to have better conditions. We're going to have medicine, because a lot of pe ople died because they got sick, they didn't have any medication. And that we're going to have more food, that we 're going to have good conditions. We're going to work but we're goin g to have good condition s. And it made sense because they want us well, that's what we thought. So they are goi ng to feed us better, they are going to give us medication, and we didn't put any resistance because we didn't know. We believed it. I was brought up to trust people, to believe. Y ou know, in my life, my family didn't ever betray me. Like I said, the only time I heard my moth er lying is this, so I had no reason why not to believe. Q: Let me ask you one qu estion. Did your family ta lk about what was happening or you just got by day to day? A: I didn™t hear much discussion , I don't know whether my parents wa nted to shield us. Believe it or not, in the worst conditions, they were telling us stories, they were teaching us . . . [end of side 1 of tape 2] Q: So you and your fa mily were put on cattle cars? A: Yes. Q: Tell me about th e trip, the journey. A: Oh that was a time I will never forget. They closed, they closed, we were put in the cattle cars, they pushed in, it was so tight that you hardly had place to sit down. There was nothing to sit on. And there was no place to relieve yourself. They locked us in with just a small window that you looked out, and they locked us, you know, hermetically sealed cattle trains. And when the journey 19 begun, there was so many people pack ed in this here, and we traveled with this here, the train, from November 17, 1942 , when we arrived in Auschwitz was Nove mber 22, 1942. So five days, right? Q: What was happen ing in the cars? A: What was happening in the cars ? It was hot. We were hungry. We were thirsty. People were crying. People were praying. Pe ople were screaming, going crazy. We had no choice, we had to relieve ourselves in front of other people. Starva tion. Fear. Where are we going? How long are we going to go? Where they are taking us? They promised better conditions, when is it going to be? And I remember parents tried to comfort, when we arrive there things are going to get better. And in the meantime, people were fainting. People got sick. It was just a living Hell. Q: As a young girl do you remember what wa s going on in your mind, wh at you were thinking about? A: What was going on, I was clinging to my parents. And I was wondering, what's going to happen? And I was crying because I saw my little brother and sister so hungry and I had nothing to give them. The parents wanted to protect us, we want to protect the parents. And we saw older people, we were always told by my parents and my grandmother, may she rest in peace, that we always help those who are less fortunate but here we were all less fortunat e. And the worst thing was that we couldn't help each other too much. We we re all in the same condition. There was no relief, no relief. And just, I kept on thinking about, I want ed to turn my mind off so I was trying to think of stories but the hunger took over. We were sleepy, there was no place to lay down. It was the most horrible journey. It was a horrible journey. And then, afte r five days like this, the stench, the tiredness, you know? The Holo caust for me, it was not, _______ ___________ was nothing to compar e to what we suffered. But th e worst suffering was that we, I saw the people I loved and I couldn' t help them, and they couldn't he lp us. We lost control of our lives. And that was even before we came to Auschwit z. And when we arrived, this train stopped all of a sudden, the door fl ung open, people who looked very strange to us in striped gray and blue stripes, wearing, with hats, ____ ______. And then the Gestapo ca me and said, "All rouse, schnell, schnell, schnell." Always schnell, always rouse. And they told us to leave everything, to leave our bundles there. We didn't have too much to begin with. And everything went so fast. And then the Gestapo were chasing us and I remember I saw a gate. It said All-might-muck-fry (ph). All-mightmuck-fry (ph) means work makes you free. But as I found out later, th e only dead was only when they liberate us. Only a few survived. Wh en we came they started to make selections. And Mengelia, at that time I didn't know that this is Mengelia, some very well fed, good looking Nazis, with the Nazis uniforms, with th e swastika, stood so, they were, you couldn't tell from their faces anything. Expression was like mo ck ing and everything. And late r I found out that the one who made the selection when we were there was Mengelia. And they started to separate male from females and make selection. To the right and to th e left. I had no idea. And all of a sudden, when we came there facing the gate where it said All-might-muck-fry (ph), this is the gate. On the righthand side, which would be the left, but on my side facing, was a Red Cross truck with a sign, Red Cross. And I remember I pointed it out to my parents. I said, "See , they kept their promise. The Red Cross stands for help." And then they said, they started to tear apart the families. Separate the families. Pulled out children from the hands of their parents. Little infants away fr om the mother. And they started to make the sel ection. To the left and to the ri ght. Immediately they took away my father. My father wa s a young man, maybe early 40's or 40 or so. And they took away my little brother and sister. My mother and I they put togeth er in the line, we were selected to go each. And at that point . . . Q: How old were your brothe r and sister at that time? 20 A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I ju st go by because I know that my little sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet school. And my brother wasn't yet barmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age. It was, at home we didn't celebrate birthdays like here because for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe in the evil eye and things like this. I don't know, superstitious. But anyhow, they were still young. So when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everythi ng went so fast that I didn't even have time to think. And then my mother turned to me and she sa id, "Yit-cola (ph), you™re a big girl. I have to go with the little children. But remember my child, no matter what's going to happen to you, don't become hateful and bitter. Don't let them destroy you." That was her last words. And all of a sudden I was a ll alone. And that's it, everythi ng that I had, everything, because I was became dead. And I didn't even have a chan ce to say good-bye because I didn't know that we are parting forever. I didn't know about gas chambers, nothing. My personal experience, nothing can historically, I never knew about gas chambers. When you saw that we were deceived. Deceived, we didn't know. So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way. And they left for the barracks. And they took them aw ay. I didn't know at that time where, I had no idea. Now when I know what's ha ppened, but I mean, at th e time when they took us away we didn't know. And they took away all ol der people, young children, pregnant woman. So I talk to myself, I remember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be together. So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated ve ry much. I figured the little children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever. Who c ould know that doctors who were trained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health. In fact, I wrote a poem ab out Mengelia. Would yo u like me to say it? Q: I think I'd like you to conti nue now and then we'll see if yo u feel like re ading it later. A: Yes. Anyhow, when they took us away all of a sudden they brought us into a place and we were, they shaved, first of all they ma de their number. We had to give up everything. I remember I was clutching a little picture, a photograph of my family, and I ha d to give it up. At first I didn't want to so they started to beat me so I figured its not wo rth it to, you know? I knew that I'm not going to be able to keep it so I gave it up. And we had to . . . Q: What is your number? A: My number? Q: They gave you a number? A: Yes. 2-5-6-7-3. Not everyone got numbers. The ones who they took away to the gas chambers, they didn't get numbers. And also, I don't know whether you ar e aware, Auschwitz was Auschwitz I, II. I was taken to Birkenau and Birkenau was where the gas chambers were, all the gas chambers. Q: Were your brother and sister still with you at this point? A: When they took away . . . Q: When they took you into the shaved and tattooing . . . A: Oh, no, no, no. They immediately had the selections. Ma ngelia sent them to the trucks. And I remember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister. My brother was protecting my little sister, they took them away. And then my mother saw them going away. I don't know how much she know, what sh e knew, but again her ___________, she made a fatal choice and she went with the children. She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl. So that was the last time I ever saw them. The whole family for four generations. And I had no idea where my Aunt, who lived in Warsaw , she was married with children, my Aunt in the __ ______. Another __________, all the relatives. I never said good-bye, I don't kn ow what's happened to them. Whether my Aunt in Warsaw died in the Warsaw ghetto, whether she was, this we will never know. 21 We don't even have, you understand why this stor y of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking. Because, I don't know whet her it was just coincidental that this story had su ch an effect on me and why I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the stor y was 13 years old, when the stepmother came. And also I was many times thinking th at we live for so lon g, since about the 1600 century my ancestors came to Po land. And yet, we had to leav e everything. Everything that was ours they inherited, they took away everything. Nothing was ours. And, you know? And then when we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads. The guys, it was done too. And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad fortune can only be understood in retrospect. So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the number. At least I'm alive with the number. And then we really got a bath, we didn't get gassed, but obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this . But we got a bath, wh ich we welcomed because a shower was, you know? And then we went out for, a whole full of the floor was laying uniforms. And they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the train. And, not from the Nazis, this wa s also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewi sh people who were interred there. And then they gave us those uniforms and they t ook away our shoes. Everything was taken. Our clothes, our shoes, our hair, our name. Everything. And all of a su dden, I realized that to them I was just a number. And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called us by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up. They always would call my number, which was 2-5-6-73 [in German], and when ever they say that I always would say under my breath , "Yit-cola (ph)". Because I thought to my self, how can I be a number? I can feel, I can think, I can laugh. Of course I didn't ha ve freedom but I had freedom of mind, freedom of thoughts. And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance. That I refused to see myself through their minds. And af ter they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair of shoes too, they gave us wood en clogs. And mine, unfortunatel y, were not matching. And we got an enamel bowl. And this was all our worldly po ssessions. In one day our entire past was wiped out. And we had no future. We di dn't know it then yet. I didn't know about gas cham bers yet. And they marched us into a barrack. Q: Let me ask you one question he re. Was there anyone in this group you knew from before? Did you know some people from your town? A: Sure. We came with people from our town who were in the ghetto. Q: Did any of the older people try to protect you because your mother wasn't with you? A: The older people didn't come in with me. Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or? A: In the ghetto, I mean, in the concentration camp there was pretty much solidarity. However, I had one bad experience. And I'll come to it. So when they gave us , and we always had to march to line up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until Auschwitz was resolved, until January 18, 1945, I had no longer freedom. No freedom. We were, everyt hing, because from the morning we woke up, we came _ _______ in the barrack, it was a real big, long barracks. And was three layer bunk beds. And crowded on the bunk beds with one blanket. And they were so low that you couldn't sit up. We couldn't sit up. The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept. There was no night clothes. From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth. I never saw myself in a mirror. Nobody ever embraced me. Nobody ever said, after having so much love. So when I'm looking back from an environment where I wa s free like a bird, to come to a pl ace where I felt like in a cage. And you know, you can put a bird in a cage but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly. They took away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free. Th ey took away my loved ones but they could not take away my desire to live. And I guess there were many horrible things 22 but probably the most horrible wa s losing everyone I loved. An d not only experiencing my own suffering, but witnessing the suffer ing of others and have to be sile nt like Buncho (ph) the Silent. And I couldn't say anything. And in the barrack s, where I could say so mething when the Nazis were not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel. Because everyone spoke a different language. And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning. So when we came in, so many people were crowded in this barrack. And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving home to be thrown into an environment like this. And everybody was su ffering. My firs t concern was, when is our family going to come? But I still was naive enough to believe what the Nazis told us, that we are going to get united. So I'm waiting. And I don't see them. So I start asking questions. And there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent. Whether they didn't want to tell us because they didn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to ? This I don't know, but whoever I asked nobody answered anything. They didn't say yes or no, nothi ng. Finally, after constantly badgering and repeating, one of the girls said, "You might as well tell her. We are all here condemned to die." And she points at the smoke and she said, "You see that chim ney? This is where your parents are." And tells me the story about the gas chambers. She said, "This is where we're all going to be." Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral, my parents took me to the funeral a nd they told me that, to take your own life is a sin. It's like spitting God and your parents in th eir face because they gave you a gi ft and its against the Jewish law. So I did not for once think about committing suicide. But at that moment, if I would have been able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grie f was. And I just was ready to give up. I was not trying to thin k about committing suicide, but I became oblivious. I didn't care what's happening. And anyhow . . . Q: Can I ask you a question here? A: Yes. Q: How long do you think yo u were there before you realized this? Or befo re you were told this? A: I didn't know the first day. Q: Was it a few months? A: No, no, not months. It was in a few days. The exact day I don't know. Not very long, not very long. Because I was constantly asking and badge ring the girls. And I'm going to go in later to describe what a day in Auschwitz wa s, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its like a funeral for me. I lost everybody. So I di dn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat. So I took the bread and left it. In the morning my bread wa s gone. And one of th e girls there, I don't remember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Ch air-ta-hoff (ph) and she actually came from a prison. I don't know whet her the prison was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than our laws. For keeping _ _______ on, for wanting to practic e our religion, for wanting to live. To kill you was legal. But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death. To survive was to them, everything that was our th ey have taken away, if we would try to keep something, we were treated like criminals. So anyhow, in the morn ing Esther says to me, "Oh poo Yit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread." And I said, "My gosh, what place is this? Stealing somebody's piece of bread." And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again. Even though I was, like my throat was locked. And I left the bread. In the nigh t for some reason we slept so many people on one bunk, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other, we had to wake the others, so somebody woke up. And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me was eating my bread. And that was almost like the last straw for me. And at that point I just didn't care what's happening. And I was sitting and crying. And I didn't know it at th e time, in Auschwitz 23 if you didn't get up for th e _________ or the countin g, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you would right away be killed, taken to the gas chambers. So a girl walks over and she ask me, "Why are you crying?" And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying. I just didn't even want to answer. Finall y she, it was something in her voic e, that I felt that like she's caring, which I started to understa nd and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, "Yes my child, but kindness and caring cannot be little things." Like when I did the ____________. And what's happened? And finally I tell her. And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread, I cried of the whole situation, of losing the fami ly and everything. So she took a piece of her bread and she broke it off and she said, "T ake it." And I didn't want to take it. Because I already knew that we are all there to be killed, that it's just a ma tter of time. So I figure d I cannot afford to get involved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes, there's going to be additional pai n, to protect myself fro m the pain. But there was something in her voice and her face and everything. Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph), Yanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call hersel f Yanka. And finally I took the bread and I said, "No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone. It 's not even worth living. I'm all alone." I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend. And from that day on, she became like my sister. We cared for each other. We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other. In Auschwitz, a piece of bread mean t life. Meant winning in the game of su rvival. So I just felt that she was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast. Here, Esther stole my piece of bread. And this girl gave away a piece of bread. I didn't even know until this day, I don't know when she came, I didn't know at that time anything. Now I kn ow that she was born in Warsaw, but I didn't know. At that time we didn't think of it. And I took th e bread and with it something in my spirit started to soar again and we made a commitme nt, Binna and I. We di dn't know if we were going to get out of there, but to live or to die with ______________, with humanness. Not to lose our dignity. And this is important to know, that in Auschwitz there were two kinds of laws. If somebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron wi th soup, people would lift up the lid and put in their bowl and grab and run. If they were lucky they could run away. If they caught them, they would get 25 on their bare behi nd. And sometimes even wo rse. But one inmate from the other, that was a no law. Would not take, because we know this meant survival. And from 1942 to 1945 I was in Au schwitz, nobody ever stole from me a nything. You know ? And we felt like we had no freedom at all. No freedom of m ovement, only in our soul and our mind could we be free. And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make. We use to switch, you know, like to share. I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or vis-a-ver sa. One day wh en she had the _________. And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if they were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure when they divided. You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so great. Binna and I trusted each othe r and we kept together our bread. We didn't keep it separate and she never betrayed me, or vice-aversa. And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my family, she became th e friend that I kept with. When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I were more like friends, under such circumstances. And when the day that th ey usually begun, when the whistle would blow, get up. And we would always, it was still dark. I didn't have a clock because as I said, my only worldl y possession was the shift, th e wooden clog and the bowl. Nothing else. So I didn't have a watch, I didn™t kn ow what day it is, I didn't have a calendar. We didn't have anything. People say, did you have this? So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn™t have more than this . . . End of Tape 2. 24 Tape 3 Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in Auschwitz was like for you. A: We didn't wake up by the cloc k. We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark. We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day. We didn't have any ex tra clothes. This was al l that we had. And there was water but we were told that th is is not good drinking water. So water was very scarce. We didn't have, we couldn't go to the ba throom when we wanted. It wa s like a collective bathroom, like the latrines you know? And it was just a wooden board and in it like cut out a piece. So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink. And therefore they got diarrhea. And because the cond itions, we couldn't wash up. We didn't have anywhere to wash. So it wasn't clea n. And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work. And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the se lections, then you would go now. So it was important. And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretendi ng that I'm washing my self, just to have some, to feel some freedom. So when I got up in th e morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the __________, I would still say the prayers, even in Auschwitz. And we would start, go to the ________ where we are co unted. Alive or dead, we had to be _________. And they used the matter that one was responsible for all. So if one person would not be found because he's si ck or wouldn't come out, or wh atever, we all had to stand no matter how long. Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, wi thout anything. If we didn't have, and we would stay, freeze. So we used to try to warm each other, one in th e back, you know somebody would stand, you st ay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each other. And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted. And sometimes we would be lucky, that everybod y was accounted for. Other times we would stay for hours. And then they would give us something, even though we didn't have enou gh of it and we wish we would have had more, but its s uppose to be coffee, it re sembled muddy water. A little beet. A piece of bread. Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Li mburger cheese, it was smelly. But we didn't get enough of it. We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat anything almost. In fact we had to restrain ours elves , sometimes not to eat things which could harm us. And in the winter, because th ere was lack of water and no place to wash, we would pick up the snow. And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that. They tried to torture us. And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear, "Links." Line up and go march. And on both sides big, long lines with the prisoners marching, with the inmates marching. And I don't know how to ca ll ourselves because wh en they talk about slavery in Egypt or _________ was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves. So prisoners, I don't know what, bu t I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not condemned to die, you know? Not that way, they used them for so mething. And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and th e Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work . And then we had to go through the gates, and at the gates many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out somebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good. Other time s we were just called, 1-2-3, 5-6-7, the 8 th out, sometimes the 10 th out, we never know. So you could not plan from one second to the other because you don™t k now whether you come back, would you be alive the next day. That's when I realized how a person was condem ned to death, you know, who has a family illness 25 must feel. And I found ou t pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the outside line so we tried to be in the inside line and not to be the very first or the very last. The less visible you could make yourself. And we marche d. When I came I was assigned to Block 8 and a Turkish woman was our Block Elster (ph). A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsibl e. And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of ti me or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter. And then we came to work. And we always worked outside the camp. And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked outside, outer-commando (ph). And what I started to realize is that th e work we were doing at that time was not usual work. We would take ston es or gravel and carry it from place to place and the Nazis used to mock us. And point to the gas chambers and ____________ th ey said, "See? That's where you™re all going to come out." And then he said, "Where is your God now?" And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the root cellar. "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. God is in the root cellar too." And I said to myself , "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go. You™re the last one of your family. If you don™t survive, the world will not know and it will be the last. It's like your family will not have existed. Go. God is he re too. But man is not here. _______________ [humanness] is not here." And I started to understand what _______ ______ means, why my parents stressed it so much. And I never for once felt like God has fail ed me. I felt the people failed me. Because God gives men choices to do good or evil. But they have chosen and they were the educated people. My family always stressed education. ____________ . In fact, my family used to say that _____________ is the highest form of religion, scie nce and achievement. And in Auschwitz, I had a chance to find out that this was true. Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees. And he's responsible for the deat h of 400,000 people including my own family. So I did not doubt God. In spite of what was happening, that I sti ll pray to God and I still believed in God and I remembered other things, which I didn™t mentioned this story and I think I will now because I thought of that story often. You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-sh ona (ph) every year, regardless of how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes. It didn't matter whether you had a lot. And most, and there was not big department stores like this here, so mostly we would go to the dressmaker to make a dress. That particular su mmer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember my mother ordered for me navy blue ___________. An d the dressmaker made me a dress, a twopiece dress, a sailor dress, a pleat ed skirt with the collar like this. And when we went to try on first the measurements and everything. And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and look in the mirror and it fit well. And I felt so proud, so happy wit h this dress. The sailor dress. And I came home and it was early Passover, before Passover. So, like a child, I wanted to put on the dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it. And when I was going to put on the dress, my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now." I said, "Oh Mom, it's gonna . . ." She said, "It might get tore and it might get stains and then you won't have it for Passover." And I said, "Oh Mom, its going to be okay." So I remember my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (p h), please. Don't take chances on something you can't afford to lose." But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please. So finally my mother said, she says, "Well, you learn about responsibility. That's the only way you™re going to learn." And I promised I won't, I'll be careful. And I had every intentions of doing it, it was not out of mischief or not caring. And I put on the dress and I came ou t. And I was very, a co mbination. In one way I could be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you that we had the ________, the rive r. And we use to go there, it had beautiful trees. And the kids came and somebody challenged, they said, "Who can climb up highest on the tree?" And I was 26 pretty good at that, you know? I was never heavy, which actually in Poland that was not looked at favorably. They use to say that she has consum ption if you were thin. People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this tree, the tree, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me. And all of a sudde n I hear somebody say, "Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother is coming." And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wear ing the good dress. And I went to get off the tree fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a branch and I tore the skirt. I came down. My mother wasn't ev en there, it was just a prank they played on me. And I was in tears. And I said, "My God. My mother begged me not to take ch ances. Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn." A nd I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a bi g tear. And when I came into the house with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much. All she said, "Take of the skirt." Beca use she saw the way I held it with tear s in my eyes, so she put two and two together. "And I'll fix it for you." But she said, "Remember one thing. It's up to you. You can wear your old dress or the dress th at I'll fix for you. But you™re going to go to services." I was crying my eyes out because I didn' t want to wear my old dress an d I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress. But I remembered the lesson. Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson. In every expe rience. And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose. And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in Auschwitz , is to lose my life. So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no. I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away. And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had. And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the th ings, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had. And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a Jewish community, without the ____________, we were always Jewish there, but we were not, Jewish people were not the only people who were in Auschwitz. There were Gypsies, there were Jehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all countries. However, the Jewish, we, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the sa me camp. The Polish girls were not together in the same barracks with us. We were separated. So in all the years that I was there, I never had any contact with a man. I'm not talking in a sexual way, bu t I mean even to be friends or to be in the company of men. And here, this is my teen-age years. The pr ice of going to _______, the price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal educatio n. The price of all the things, of liberty, which I started to realize ho w im portant freedom is. Ou r liberty. And this is when, when I felt all this here, th en I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down how I feel. But I didn't ha ve. And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run away from the harsh reality. So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt and it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this earth by invisible strings, chained to a destiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the sky with a heavy sigh, but my wings have been clip ped and I no longer can fly. An d I was looking out and seeing the physical surroundings. Arou nd us was the barbed wi res, the watch towers, the crematories. The smoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud. There was so much mud there that when we wore those wooden clog s, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and on cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the ________ bite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on th e job they would mock us, they would beat us. We could not, we were not allowed to help each other. And the useless 27 words. And I was thinking to myself , my gosh, if this is, if this is our _______, I don™t even have the word to express it, its like a different planet. It's in the same world like a different planet, a planet of destruction, of death. The dead we re not buried and was mountains, everything was mountains. Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them. And constant living under the fear of maybe today they are going to take you away, an d if you got sick you ha d no luck, there was no medication. Everything that they promised was not. And once I found out what they do with the people who come, that they take away, and I hear d music playing. And I asked somebody, "Where is the music?" And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing. When the transport was coming and they ma de selections, sending away peopl e to the gas chamber, the music was playing. Classical music. A nd later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I knew that my people are burning, th e music is playing. And you know, even after the Holocaust I always loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry because the visions of the little child ren, of everything sepa rated and how they tore apart. And then, after a long day, again, walking through the gate, the selections. Some people got beaten to death. Other people from working were injured, some peopl e got sick. And every day there became lesser and lesser of us. And the bodies, more skeletal. And we didn't, couldn't take a shower or anything and we started to accumulate lice. So a big treat was when we coul d take off that dress and try to ________ to expose of the lice. And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a comedy comparing to what it was. That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to describe everything. So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole day, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say app eal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are there. And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread. It wasn't enough to live and not enou gh to die. And many people, many, constantly people died. And seeing, here you was with someb ody, a few minutes later they we re gone. And constantly new transports, and you couldn't speak. So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness. Like I started before to tell you, is all this ti me not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush. They tried to dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarra ssed to talk about it, but when I remember what my parents taught me, that my ______ _____ does not depend on how other treat me but how I treat others, than I'm not ashame d because I haven't done anyt hing to deserve it. We didn't even have a piece of toilet tissue. All the time I was in Auschwitz, I couldn 't have a piece of toilet tissue. This is how they deprived us. Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing. You know, they tried to reduce us to be like non-huma ns. And t he mocking constantly and everything. So again, each day the same thing, over and over, starting the ______ and just hanging on another day. Just if you could get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the gas chambe r, go through the day and come home together with Binna, that's _____________. And many times, people would go in the evening and somebody would say, "Liste n, I'm going to give you a little of my soup. You want to give me a piece of your bread?" Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread. And the starvation. And then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are goin g to give us extra bread, who wants to have extra bread? And I learned very quickly, whenever they ca lled for volunteers for something, I never wanted to volunteer. I felt, others suffered but I don™t want to get involved to do something which wouldn't be __ ______, you know? And what I found out one time, they took, they made a selection. They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they took away the girls and not until after the war, on e who was taken away and survived, I found out that they took them for experiments. And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia. You know, they castrated some men and some women, the operations, so they could never bear children anymore. And some people, one wo man, she is already dead now, but a few years ago she was still 28 alive, I don't know what they did to her but hair was growing on her face so she had to go Electrosomething, I forget how th is is called, they had to take it off from her face. Hair grew like a man, you know? And different things. There were plenty, I know certain people who I personally know who got married but never could ha ve children because of those expe riments. And some got sick. But the majority died, they didn't survive this here. Yes, and anothe r thing. There was a ______________, you know? So, and they sometimes Menge lia or other doctors would come and we had to strip and, which is __ _______. He would lo ok us over and thos e who looked already skinny or they are too sick or, away to, but at that point, away to the gas chambers. There was a block where they would send away, and sometimes they didn't have en ough time to get them out, so they would put them, put them in this block and they no longe r gave them food or anything. And then they take them away. If you got sick, it wa s tough luck. Then you were a goner. Until this day, I cannot, I'm thinking and I'm amazed myself that I didn 't, wasn't able to be clean there. I didn't have medications, a few times I got sick. Not like real serious . Without an aspirin, without medication, everything else. And yet to survive. And then constantly transports. And then was one day, we were called _______, they asked us to stay longer and th ere was a girl and her name was _____________, someth ing with a "Z" begins, I forget her last name, Zit-a-emir (ph), something like this here. I didn't know he r personally but I knew of her. She was a messenger, you know? And I don™t know the exact story b ecause I don't, I'm not, I was not a witness when she run away, I didn't see her run away. But I know that one day we were all called together and we were, they prepared a gallow and they were going to hang he r because she run away and they brought her back, they found her. And she, when they found her, I don't know from where because in Auschwitz I couldn't get anything more than what I got, the bowl and the clot hes. She had a razor someplace hidden. And before they hang he r, she cut her wrists in my pres cence. Then there was another hanging. This hanging I did no t witness because Rosa Loberta (p h), my __________, the beautiful Rosa, this story I just know fr om my __________, the fe w to have survived. That she was also hanged in Auschwitz because she wasn't dead and they destroyed one of the crematoriums. And when the Nazis started to lose th e war, of course I didn't know about it because we had no outside communication. Completely cut off. That's why I say, its in this world but a planet like a different world because we were isolated completely. They started to speed up the gassing and they wanted to destroy everybody because even though he is losing the war but he still was carrying on with the plan of destroying the Jewish people. So the girl s made to destroy the ga s chambers. And anyhow, there is somebody who's na me is Noy-ia Zub-o-dal-vich (ph), he lives in Israel. And he was able, because they kept him in solitary, and they tortured her. And from him I know this story. That they hang her. And before they hand her, she said, "Ha-zak viv-lots (ph)", the strong and brave. And what they wanted from her is th at she should denounce, they inte rrogated her too and they wanted her that she should tell who the others were. The resistance , you know, she was involved with other people. She, from the story th at I've heard, that she was smuggling pieces of ammunition or something, but as I said, I'm not a witness to that but I heard. So there was resist ance but very, not speaking for the Warsaw ghetto we know that resi stance, but this I'm not going to speak because I wasn't in those ghettos, I wasn't th ere. But the very fact, to want it to go on knowing that nobody is left anymore. There is no place to go back or anything. So surviving, and we didn't know how others, what's going on, wh at are they doing with the war or anyt hing. But I kept constantly asking myself, the German people at that time were the most educated people an d yet they did the most horrible things. A doctor who takes the Hippocratic oath to heal sick people is murdering healthy? And everything, it seemed to me li ke ironical. The youngster he considered too young to live and the old were too old to live and the teen-agers, from teen-a ge years to older a little bit, they were just 29 right to go to Hell and live and to suffer and to di e there. So it was extrem ely, constantly living with pain to see that everyday there is less and less. And there was the son-day-commander (ph). And the son-day-commander (ph) was a group of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz who were operating the involvement with gassing the people. And I didn™t know it then but now, afterwards I found out, and almost I was in there. I returned to Poland and I went to the gas chambers now because I never saw a gas chamber inside. And what I, so we saw, I have photograp hs and I saw it by myself. The process that they had, that to tell the people that they are going to take a bath but instead to put on gas, this was out complete ly of my experience both historically and privately. I never heard this. And not only that, everything that they took away that was ours became theirs . . .[end of side 1 of tape 3]... You know, all the values , all the many beliefs th at I've been taught and many things, I had to tell them everything. It was not just the physically, but to tell them becaus e I started to ask questions of myself. I said, what is education for if it leads to Auschw itz, to gas chambers? Imagine. Not only did they took away our possessions, our homes, our tr aditions and everything, but a lot in Poland, gold teeth was our status symbol. Plus people did it to fix their teeth, but those who were wealthier used to make the crowns for the teet h, they put in gold teeth. So when the people were dead, before they went in they cut th eir hair and this was used for German economy, it was for mattress stuffing and everything. And I was thinking, we had straw mattresses. My parents didn't go to college, and my grandmot her. But how did they live? I started to compare the values. And then, is another thing, from the teeth they took away everything and they selected, the glasses, and every single thing they took away from every part of the body. From the skin, lamp shades and everything. So everything was, again, what is te chnology for? And this is why, when I got out, I could no longer have the same values. I had to te ar down everything and to compare. What did my parents teach me? What did my grandmother teach me? What does my re ligion teach me? That the most important thing was a human life, to save one life, the Talmud teaches us, is like to save the whole world. And here was my mother who didn't have college degrees, was a extremely intelligent woman, well-red and intelligent and very artistic, but she didn't have college degree. And yet she resisted. She resisted both physically and sp iritually. She did not gi ve up Cal-fus (ph). And from one person that is now seve ral generations of people. Can you imagine how many generations would be if they wouldn't have killed the six million? How many people? And one Mengelia could do so much damage. And that's when I started to realize, by going back. Not everything that I reflect while being there. Many things I reflected upon until this day. And I started to say, so I realized something very important. That four groups of people ac tually influenced my destiny. Because the Nazis, the only reason why the Nazis did this to us is because we were born Jewish. I did not choose my parents and my parents didn't choose to die in th e gas chambers, to be murdered. They didn't die. They didn't die. They were murdered. Th ose who starved of starvation, those who were killed or those from diseases , they were murdered because they put us in those conditions. And everything that was ours became their by brute force, by terror an d by deception. And this is why I start about honesty. And then I started to re alize, when I look back now, I realized also that there are some things you cannot buy without money but there are al so some things we cannot buy for money. And those are the things that I miss the most. No money in the world can replace the six million Jewish people and five million non-Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazis. Q: I want to ask you some specifi c questions about Auschwitz. You' ve told me quite a bit but I'd like to learn a little bit more about who the guards were? How they treated you? Who were the people you lived with? Wh ere were they from and did that keep changing? A: Well in Auschwitz ev erything kept changing constantly. Because people were dying very fast, okay? And people were coming constantly. So the turnover wa s very quick. People came. The 30 people in Auschwitz, we were in the same barrack but as I told you , we could not speak each other's language. Some could. The people who spoke Yiddish came very handy for me. Because in Europe not everybody, but those who came from re ligious homes, they could speak Yiddish. So it, as far as the guard, the people in the barracks I couldn't speak with everybody, nor did I have the energy, nor was there enough time. We came home, we were dead tired. And once we gave us the piece of bread we were lucky that we could lay down our heads because before we knew it, it was morning again. Q: How many people slept on your bed with you? A: I think it was like about six people or something like this here. Q: In that one-third of the bunk? A: Yes. And the bunks were so low you couldn't sit up. You couldn't sit up. And sometimes it happened that somebody died in the middle of the ni ght. Couldn't do anything about it. The corpse. Q: Were you aware, I mean at certain periods be cause you were there a long time, you were there two years? A: I was from 1942 to 1945. Q: Yeah, the end of 1942? A: In November. Q: Yes. Were you aware of period s when there were less people ther e or all of a sudden there was a huge new transport coming in? A: Towards the end when they started to lose th e war, there was more transport. They were bringing more people. It's like, it seemed to me from looking back now, that Hitler was determined to destroy everybody. He was al so determined that there shouldn't be any traces. And another thing, which, see somebody would run away. Everything is relevant to conditions I've learned. For instance, if one girl would run away, there were a lo t of obstacles. The first obstacle was that if one would run away the others would stay in ______ __ until they found _______ of that, we all would be punished. So those who had a conscious and wh o cared said, how can I save my life at the expense of others? Secondly, they evacuated, Auschwitz was called before Oswiecim, it was a town. In fact there is a survivor who is from Oswiecim. That was her hometown. So it was a town like any other towns in Poland. So they cleare d, they evacuated all the people from there because they didn't want to have witnes ses. Plus for miles and miles aw ay there were no people so you couldn't hide. And Auschwitz, Birkenau was the only concentratio n camp to my knowledge, but I don't know everything, so as far as I know until this day Birkenau was the only co ncentration camp where they made, they put on number s. So you had the nu mbers. Your head was shaved. You had no, you were wearing the cl othes. And the same nu mber that you had on th e arm was also put on the dress, shift. Where could you go? And there was barbed wires, guards, watch towers. So it's one of the two, she would want to go to the barbed wires because, so two things happened. Either you get electrocuted or you get shot from the guards. So it was impo ssible almost to run away from Auschwitz. Q: Did people try? A: Not too many tried fo r the reason that I told you, because there was no place to go. Who would take you in? Where would you go ? So not too many people. Some people might have jumped the train, but I don't know of any. Q: Were there many suicides? A: Relatively very fe w. That I am surprised. Very few. For me, its like, when I told you, at the point when Binna and I decided to accept it, I accepted her piece of bread but I also accepted what she offered more, her friendship. At that point, I made a decisio n. I will, first of all, of my 31 upbringing, I told you what my, this here had a very great influence. Plus I said, I will not collaborate in my own destruction. I did everything to try to keep myself clean, to keep myself, under the conditions. I even went through like the motions of washing myself just to feel and try to think, its ironic we were thinking, I remember that Binna and I was talking, said, if we're going to go out from here, once in my lifetime I want to s till have a whole loaf of bread. That was my dreams. Dreams change. It wa s one of my dreams. When I wa s, before the Holocaust, I was dreaming of getting a good formal education, become a writer. When I wa s in Auschwitz, I was dreaming about once in my life, before I die, on ce to have the feeling of not going, my stomach should not turn from hunger, have cramps, hunger cramps. And the ot her dream was still to be free. To be able to walk once in my lifetime still without th e guards walking with me, with the guns and having to march. I-spy-dry-links (ph) , I-spy-dry-links (ph), I still hear that in my head , the columns. And to see people dying and sufferi ng in a world of destruction wh en I was brought up to respect life. This was, and another thing that we were na ive, and I see now that its not so, is that whoever goes out, if I have one dress, ju st a clean dress and someplace to put my head I will not ask for anything more, but if I have a lo af of bread, a clean dress. We wa nted so little. But we still have not faced reality then because in concentration camp, in Auschwitz, I was with other people. And actually, even though the conditions were so horrible, somebody still took care, I still have someplace to, even that was the horrible conditions, but I had where to put my head down. And even though there was so little, hardly enough to get through the day, food, I still had somebody. So after age 13 I was never on my own. I never, I was protectiv e, loving environment. Here completely alone except for Binna, which became my frie nd from, in Auschwitz. I didn't know her from before. And then, to go out in the world, I didn 't face it because at that time all we had, all we were thinking about is of surviving. Of having the things, the things that I want. So at that time I wasn't thinking of other things. It's not until I came out __________ that everything hit me. And so we were in Auschwitz and with all this here, constantly dead around us. No separation between life and death. The dead people were no t buried there. They put them, th ey took them in, they had like a little wagon and they would pull them away. And if somebody died when we were at work or was killed, we had to carry them back to the concentr ation camp to be counted, because we knew we are accountable. They made us responsible, one for the other. And this was going on for years. And not having, loneliness, cold, starvation. Q: You had to carry bodies, you personally carried bodies back? A: I personally was fortunate that I didn't have to , but there were many ti mes that our commanders, you know, it was a commander, you were assigned to a specific group, we had to carry home, somebody was killed or died on the way, we had to carry them home. Dead or alive they had to be accounted for. Q: Do you remember other things that you and your frie nd talked about? A: We was talking about how, that when we going to ge t out we are going to be grateful. And you know, I'll tell you someth ing. You know, intuition has nothing to do with logic, right? But you know, I once read that the heart knows of the reason, that reason doesn't know heart. But actually, one time, its like, I don't know, it was not at night, its not what I was dreaming. Its just like a, its like a vision that I see that I am free and people are standing around me a nd asking me what the number is. I didn't know whether th e outside world knows. I didn't kn ow at all what it was. I was isolated. Imagine, in older years, not only did th ey take away everything from me but they stole three, six years, nearly six year s of my life. They stole the ch ance of education. They stole the chance, I never could go to proms, to dates. So fr om one thing to the other. And still they didn't finish in Auschwitz. In 1945, it was January 8. 32 Q: Okay, but I want to still ask you a few more questions before we move on? A: Yes. Q: When it started getting, more tran sports would come in. Did the conditions get worse or did they stay pretty much the same? A: The condition got constantly wo rse for me because I became weaker. My body was almost like a skeleton. And the longe r you suffer the harder it gets. And to see the constant destruction. Because I, I cannot praise myself and say, but I had, it was helping me to see the people suffer. It is helping me when I see that, I want ed to help somebody. They didn' t allow us to help each other. We had to do it in hiding. Let's say if somebody fell and you were to lift up and to help you got beaten. Sometimes you both could get killed. Q: So you got weaker but you didn't get less food or trea ted worse or anything like that? A: Well personally it didn't ch ange that much, but the only thin g is that there was more, the transport was so constantly, the smoke coming and th e music playing. And more people, we lost more people. So that was the worst thing. Q: Did the music playing when you went in and out of work too? When you left for work every day? A: Basically the music plays mos tly when a new transport came. Q: Did you pass by or did yo u live near the crematorium? A: I have, I was never in the building where the crematorium b ecause if I would be there I wouldn't be here speaking to you. Q: No, I'm saying were you nearby there? A: No, not so near. Q: So you didn't see the people being taken there, that kind of thing? A: No. Even my own fami ly. When they took away, I just saw them taking them on the trucks, but I didn't see them taking th is here. But what they did with them and the conditions there, this I found out afterwards. I also found out that the people who worked in the crematorium, every three months they would gas them too. Because they were mo st anxious that nobody sh ould know. They wanted to wipe out every trace of the crime. Q: Who were the guards? Who were your guards? A: I didn™t know them personally. Q: Were they Germans? Were they Po lish? Were there Jewish guards too? A: No. No Jewish guards. Mo stly I heard German. There wa s also like somebody who watched over us. We were watched consta ntly. Back breaking labor, wh ich was not useful, starvation, isolation, all those things you know, any, this is why if there is a pl ague we experienced it. If there is a plague we experienced this. Q: So your guards and the work commandos. Your ________ __, all of these people you really didn't have any contact with, other than them watching you? A: Yes. Q: Were they mean to you? A: The guards were terribly mean because if you for one second to stop to say something you got beaten. If you wanted to help so mebody you could get beaten or shot . They teased us, they mocked us deliberately. You know, and constantly lived under the fear that you can be taken away. The fear of getting sick. So constantly. And then af ter a while if you, like I made up my mind, live or die. Because everybody has to di e. But it was important to, I was grateful each day I __________ they did not assign me some kind of duties or things to do which would dehumanize me really. Because what they said about the dead didn' t de humanize me. That dehumanized them. 33 Q: What about corruption? Were you aware of other prisoners trying to get stuff or being able to kind of manipulate the situation? A: From whom to get stuff? W: From whom ever they coul d get, I don't know, guards or? A: The thing is, the guard s, those who were there were already sadistic and cruel, otherwise they wouldn't be there. An d with the guards we couldn't, I told you from the beginning, it was ____________, they, we were, th e dogs. A dog should also be treated with respect because everything that God created should, but the dogs had better than we had. They loved all their dogs. Sometimes they would let their dogs bite some people. And a lot of mo ckery. That I felt, okay, they say that they had to carry out their duty. But they really didn't. They could resist. They could say no. They couldn't maybe, when Hitler became so powerful, but they could have done that in the beginning. My mother risks my life and hers and she wouldn't do because she would rather have died than to turn in another person and to surviv e on somebody else's expense. Q: Were all the prisoner s in your block Jewish? A: Yes. Only Jewish people. In our barracks were only Jewish. I didn't have contact with non Jewish people. I didn™t have any contact, there was no men. The me n were separated. In all those years that I, in all the time I was there th e only people that I sa w is Jewish people. Q: You came from a very loving family? A: Yes. Q: A very affectionate, loving fami ly. Were you able to recreate some of that warmth and affection with your friend there? A: Yes. We were very, very nice to each other. We tried to help ea ch other. Like I said, we would share, when she had her worse day she would give me a little of her food and we always tried to encourage, not to give up. We used to say, and we spoke always Yiddish with each other, and I used to say to her, "They want to kill us. We must not help them." We really make a conscious effort. Physically I had no choice because they coul d take us away anytime. They didn't need a reason. They had complete control of our lives. But at least we tried not to destroy, we tried to encourage each other. Maybe tomorrow something will happen. _______________. And I didn't realize it but I must have had always a very deep faith, very deep faith. I'll tell you something, which is not, it didn't happen then . . . Q: Let me just, I just want to fi nish this. As I'm trying to get a sense of how all of the prisoners related to each other, the, you mostly related to this one girl? The older people didn't try to take care of the younger people or any of that? A: There wasn't so many older . . . Q: Well, but there were people older than you? A: Yes, there were people older. No. People were helpful to each other because we knew that we are, we share the same circumstances, the same destiny. Th ere were, I talk mostly about Binna because I was closest with her. With her I beco me, we shared such a traumatic, such an extreme experience. And that's when you really get to know people . That's where the weaknesses, and when I saw the cont rast of Esther to her. With Esther I ne ver hounded, I never, I wish if she is alive until today, I don™t even hold that against her because under those circumstances not everybody was strong, to resist. But the point it, she didn't want to do me harm , she just c ouldn't resist the hunger so I, this was my only experi ence where somebody from the girls were mean to me. I never suffered any cruelties from the Jewish girls there. Q: Did you share physical affection? I don™t mean necessa rily sexual, but just that sort of warmth that people need from each other? 34 A: There wasn't to o much of this here. We were dirty, we were cold, we were tir ed constantly. On the job you were this, but I could f eel for instance that Binna cared for me. Because as I went to the gate, we were going to go through the gate, and wh en she knows that they always looked how you look, not that they needed __________ because they took away my family and they were Nazi, so she would say, "Yit-cola (ph), you ar e pale." She pinched my cheeks. I would do the same for her. If we stood in the pen or where we stood, she said, "Get into this light." She was three years older than I, so it was like, in fact, after the liberation when we were together so me people said, "Well, she's acting like she's your mother." She just felt about me lik e I'm her younger sister. But affection, hugging, kissing? There was not, no, th ere was not affection. Yo u feel, you don™t have just __________, okay, physical affection is very important b ecause at home I could not walk by my parents or my grandmother with out a hug and a kiss. But this was not the place, it was not the time. If you would see, we were so thin, so skeletal , so dirty, so lonely, so terrible, so full of pain, that those things wasn't even on the mind. You know, the hug. It wasn't because we hug each other, there was not, you came home from work. I don't rememb er it, special hugging each other. The only time was like if one of us broke down, the other would embr ace and say, try to comfort and say, especially like this. No, I felt deprived and I missed this a lot because I was always an affectionate person. Q: That's why I was asking you. A: Yes, I missed it terribly. Q: Were you at all aware of when Jewish holidays were? A: No. Q: Did you have much information about the rest , what was going on in the rest of the camp? A: Not at all. Very isolated, not knowing what, just this world. Getting cup, coming to the barrack, waiting, and by the time you got your piece, little food, and everything and the _________ finished, especially in the cold, you were so glad, you were so tired that you laid down. Sometimes you were too tired to talk even. Q: When you first got there, we re there prisoners who had been there longer who would give you advice? A: When I came in the beginning, I described to y ou the conditions. I was very, very down, very worried to what's happened to my family. But when I found out I was so, felt betrayed, I felt shocked, I felt grieved, I felt so many emotions. An d I was just, I don't know if it wouldn't be for Binna, whether I would have even su rvived. Just knowing that we ne ed each other for support, that she is already an orphan and alone. And you can't im agine how many times I told her about the story, Buncho (ph) the Silent. Because I rememb er that, when my mother finished reading this story and I asked her, I'll never fo rget this, and I said, "How could Buncho (ph) the Silent endure so much suffering and pain?" And my mother answ ered me, "My child, some times are many stronger than iron and other times we can't enough lie, but no one know s their own strength until they are ever tested." And that's when I found out, if somebody would tell me , this I remember this thing. That the very first time when I came and I saw the conditions, I saw everything. And for the first time I was isolated from my famil y, I said to myself, at that time I was not in contact with anybody yet, I'm not going to survive here one day. And you know something? It was ironic. When I went on the March of the Living, there was a girl and the first day she said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), I'm not going to make it." And I sa id, "Survivors don't give up, honey." And I told her, that when I was in concentration camp, that I' m not going to make it, an d I made it. You're going to make it, I'm going to help you. And she called me, y ou know, what kind of award I go t. It was funny. At the end, when we were going already from the airport to Philadelphia, two kids who were very creative, they 35 observed everyone. So so mebody, they took a napkin and they tore it in pieces and they wrote down, one got the award for the be st dancer, one for the best whatever, and I got the Bobbie (ph) award. I was to them the Bobbie (ph), the grandmother. And she even introduced me to her father by saying, "Yit-cola's (ph) my adopted grandmother." And all the kids say, I'm like a Bobbie (ph) to her. Q: Did you toward the en d do different work assi gnments or did you stay mostly on that one? A: No. Toward the end of it almo st, toward the end of 1944 I got a lucky stroke. I was given a job to the ___________, the __________ they called it, the _____________. _________ they were called because we were wearing red kerchiefs. Q: How did you get this assignment? A: Just was lucky. Somebody must have died or something or maybe they needed more. I don't know. But one day, instead of taking me out, they took me to the commander. And that was, I wish it would have happened earlier then I would not have lost so much weight and so much suffering. Because this was better, for several reasons. First of all, you didn 't have to work outside. The outside work was a killer. Many , many people died. I was youn g and maybe that helped me to survive, I don't know. But anyh ow, in the ____________ we would go, we work inside. Our work consisted of selecting, you know the people who arrived they to ok away everything from them. It came from the, and all the bundles were brought to the ___________ __, they called it. Why they called it Canada (ph) I cannot tell you, I don™t know. But this is what it was called. And my job, and the jobs of those who were there, was to take apart the bundles and to select and to put in bundles the towels with towels, and all this went to Germans fo r their economy. Everything that was ours became theirs. Q: Was it strange goi ng through other pe ople's belongings? A: It was very strange. But we had no choice. We had to obey or ders. At least, it was not hurting people. Those were things. End of Tape 3. 36 Tape 4 Q: You were telling me about the work commando at Canada. A: Yes. In Canada we had to work also ever y day. My work consisted, and everybody's work actually consisted, we took apart the bundles and we had to select them. Put each item of the same kind in bundles and in places. Now, let me start with the advantage for me. The advantage was that I didn't have to work outs ide. I was shielded a little from the cold and from the heat. The work was easier than it was to drag the stones and everythi ng else. And also I couldn't take anything from there but there were Nazis that were watching us too. But what I could do, occasionally but not always, nobody could see. Let's say if I found a piece of bread, I coul dn't take it out but I could take a piece of it and eat it. So that provided a little extra food for me. Then there was something that they did that if it wouldn't be for what my mother taught me, th at my ___________ does not depend on how others treat me but how I trea t others, I would feel ashamed to tell this here. It's just like a woman who is raped, and it doesn't have a good self and she doesn't understand that it™s the victimizer not the victim who is suppose to feel ashamed, then I would feel ashamed to tell you this here. But I don't. I feel pained. When we were leaving, every si ngle day, the most humiliating, the most painful thing, they would search us intern ally so we wouldn't smug gle out any diamonds, any gold, because sometimes you did find those things ther e. So we couldn't take out anything. And that was so humiliating for me. A girl who was modest, who wouldn't even undress in front of her parents. And you know I was lik e a budding teen-ager when the Holo caust begun. And here, to go through, that sometimes I wish I would have still walked in the outside commando because each time they did this, I felt like I was dying by inches . It was so humiliating and so disgusting to have these Nazis to search me. So as far as this, if you heard stories th at somebody smuggled out, that's not true. _________, maybe they didn't tell you, but they searched us. They searched us every inch, all over, even internally so what, how can you smuggle something out? Q: Were you searched by men or women? A: Sometimes were men, sometime s women. It was not, and eith er way it was disgusting, it was horrible. I feel, I cannot tell y ou how much, how I felt. Because I was never, until I came to _____________ I never had a internal examination. And this wa s my experience, it was horrible. And also the horrible thing was to see, to know that, seeing all the things from some families brought beautiful thin gs because they were not in ghetto, they came in and many people were rich. And knowing that the peopl e are dead and that these clothes ar e going to go away for the German economy, that for the Jewish child ren who were wearing the clothes, Jewish mothers and fathers and grandfathers. I shed plenty of tears. The only ad vantage was that I was warm and had a little bit of extra food. That was th e only advantage of this job. Q: So in your two years plus in Auschwitz, basi cally you had this job and you had that outside work? A: That's all. It started physically and emotiona lly and spiritually in every single way. That's why I related to you the story about go ing to ___________ because I thought, how could a writer stand so much suffering and abuse, and I don't know ________ because at that time, it was almost like it felt, why was Buncho (ph) the Silent silent, why didn't he say someth ing? But I had to find out that I had to be silent to survive because even when they called me number, tr ied to reduce me to a number, I couldn't say loudly or anything, but und er my breath I said, Yit-cola (ph). You know what I called my number? My ba dge of honor. And somebody aske d me once, a reporter, why do you call it your badge of honor? And I told him. I got the number merely for being born Jewish. To be born Jewish or Gentile is not a choice, but to murder people because they are different, because they are Jewish or Gentile and because somebody gets a crazy idea that somebody is 37 superior to somebody else, which is a figment of Hitler's imagination, then this is something which made me even more proud to be Jewish. Q: Toward the end, did you have a sense that you might get out of th ere? That the war was shifting, that there was a possibility you would be free? A: I had no, I didn't ha ve any knowledge what was going outsi de. There was no paper, no ______ of communication, no meeting with anyb ody else. I didn't have any contact. Q: No rumors? A: No rumors. Nothing. I didn't hear anything. I don' t know, it seemed to me like all I did was work, come home, just waited. C ouldn't wait to get, to lay down, to put down your head, it was so exhausted and cold. And sometime s, you know what was our, but that was not done deliberately, we slept so many on one bunk bed. So out of ne cessity of the overcrowded ness we slept on the side like I told you, close one another. So that was our, you know bo dy gives out heat too. So we had one blanket, everybody was pulling in different direction. So layi ng, whoever was lu cky was laying in the middle, felt less co ld. So it was not, its an existence, not knowing. Can you imagine? All those years, not having the things which you take for granted. Like a piece of toilet tissue? How degrading. Q: So you had no idea what was going on? A: I didn't know anything what was going on. I was living, each day was the same from day to day. Just knew inwardly, emotionall y, spiritually that I need to hold on. But that's all. Q: And by saying that, I need to hold on, th ere obviously was some h ope that you would get through it? A: No, I don't. But you know what ? I remembered the upbringing I had, that we never, we don't give up hope. We don't give up hope. In fact, I re member saying, from my family, __ _________ ______________, which means as long as one vein is still moving there is hope. So we were hoping. I had even after th e Holocaust situations where everybody gave up h ope. I didn't. I'm not this kind of a person. Q: So how did you happen to leav e Auschwitz? A: I didn't, again, I didn't make any choice. In Auschwitz, the only choi ce I made is, you cannot always pick circumstances but you can pick responses . So the only choice I made, to live or to die, with dignity, with Menschlichkeit, and to hold on as long as I ca n. So I didn't make any choice, but one morning we woke up and I didn't even know what's happ ened. We didn't have the ______________. They started to chase us out. And we star ted on the death march. And that was the most horrible thing because yo u survive for so long and here we had to march because the Nazis wanted to make sure that we should not get into the hands of the Ru ssians. They wanted, they blew up some, I didn't see them do that, but later I wa s, now I know how many things they blew up. They tried to destroy all the evidence of the crimes that they committed. So we had to march. Q: What did they say to you? What happened? A: They didn't say anything. They said, "Just go. Go." And what happ ened, and we even in concentration camp we were not allowed ultimately to help each other, in their presence. But here was even worse. Because if one, we had to walk. It was, imagine Poland is very, very cold. We were now in April and it was still pretty cold. Q: January. A: No, no. I was . . . Q: The march? A: No, the march of the living wa s in January but when I was now in Auschwitz, when I went to visit now . . . 38 Q: Okay. But I'm talking about, I'm confusing this. Let's stay with 1945 because it's getting confusing. A: Right. I'm just trying to tell you the truth, very cold. Q: It was in January? A: In January, January 18 th we were chased out. I didn't know at the time if everybody was left or not because there was no time to find out. And what they did or didn't do, once I wasn't there I couldn't see. But we had to march on foot. If you stoppe d, if you fell, they shot you. If somebody fell or couldn't go you were not allowed to help them. So many people, ther e were plenty people who I saw on the way who was layi ng dead. And we could not do anything about it. This is the most, this probably, besides my own experience from my own sufferi ng, this was the most horrible thing for me. To be human and no t to be able to help another human being, if somebody falls. Lived for so many years and then in that way to die? A lot of people died on the way. A lot of people died on the way. And we started to march on January 18, 1945 and we came to Ravensbruck. I'm thinking ____ _______, I wrote down the date someplace. It escapes me now because I'm so, I'm going to give you the dates I wrote it down but not right now. Q: January 24? A: I think. Six day march, after six days, okay? Q: Were there people from a lot of different barracks or was it ju st your group on this march? A: There was lots of people. I don't know whether the whole camp or not because I don't know, what the case was. But there was, you could see like marching very, very long. And not until we were almost German, and then they took us to this , to Revensbruck. We arrived to Ravensbruck. Q: Okay. On the march, did they give you any food? Did you stay someplace at night? Did you sleep? A: We had to walk. Walk and walk. Not until we were already on the German soil, and I don't know exactly what spot it was, then there was like some trucks that picked us up. And on the truck on the way we fell asleep, standing, sitting, in anyplace. But while you walked you had to stay alive and to be silent, to be Buncho (ph) the Silent. Q: Did they give you any bread or anything? A: Not while we were walking. Some pe ople had a little piece, people died of thirst, of cold. It was so cold and with the clogs, with th e frozen feet. And by that time we were skeletons. Most of us was more dead than alive. If it would take a little longer we probably would not have made it. Q: Was it all wome n on the march? A: I marched with all women. Maybe there were me n too but when they chas ed us out of the camp from the rest it was, I mostly sa w women. Maybe men came too but wh en they took us out we were all women. Q: And you were wi th your friend? A: Yes. Fortunately she made the march. And then we came to Ravensbruck. Q: Oh I know, there was one other question I did want to ask you. As you were marching did you notice any of the local people along the way? A: I didn't notice anything. I was just having one th ing in mind, the only thin g I looked if Binna is still walking with me. That was my concern and if they other girl s, if nobody is, and I knew with the last strength, I don't know w ith what strength I, I remembered my mother's words, "Sometimes a man is stronger than I am." Q: I just wondered if people saw you marching? A: This I don't know. I was too involved, to make sure that I can make it, you know, when you went so long. 39 Q: So what happened when you arrived at Ravensbruck? A: We arrived at Ravensbruck, that's a date that I also wrote but right now I'm so upset, when I'm thinking about this Canada, the ___________, the search. Q: I think you've said that you we re there about two to three weeks? A: Yes. I think February 24 I think? Q: January 24 to February 11? A: February 11 th, right. January 18 th we were chased and then we ca me six days later, the six-day march, and then we came in February 11th. And there was also, this was the only concentration camp, death camp, on German soil that has also gas chambers. Q: Ravensbruck? A: Ravensbruck. Q: And you were there for two or three weeks? A: Yes. Q: What was it like? A: What was it like? Same kind of suffering, same kind of su ffering still. They still didn't let go. And I made a stew and Esth er dead. They took us, this time we didn't have to walk already, they took us with trucks. And they brought us to another concentrati on camp in Malchow, Germany. In the Malchow, Germany they had no gas chambers. Q: You didn't work in Ravensbruck did you? A: Not very much. It wa s not a long time. It wa s already confusion. Did some work but it was not already as extensive as it was in Auschwitz. Q: So in the daytime? A: We did work but, yes we did work. I'm trying to think because I know I worked in an ammunition factory, but that was in Malchow. Because I remember we sabotaged a lot of the things there. Q: So, in Ravensbruck during the day . . .? A: We did work. I don't remember exactly what t ype of work we did there. To an ammunition factory or something. There was not any Canada or anything like this here anymore. I don't remember. I don't have that many because Ausc hwitz, other towers, everything ___________, this is why I, the others is, but I know that there wa s crematoriums. I was less shielded. Q: Do you remember any striking differe nces between Ravensbruck and Auschwitz? A: It wasn't as huge. I didn't hear the orchestra playing so that was the, and there wasn't so many people. And I didn't stay so long so there I have , when I speak even though I was there but I must not speak of Auschwitz because that's where, it was the last day when I came with family, that was the last day on earth for my en tire family. Thousands of Jews from the ghetto Nove Mesto including my friends and relatives . And the first day of ______ ________, that's why Auschwitz was the worst of it, Birkenau, that was the worst. Q: Well of course, and you also were there much longer. I was just trying to get a picture. A: Yes, we did work but I don't, I remember that after th at, after Auschwitz, I no longer worked on the outside commando. So it must either an ammun ition factory or something. To be very honest with you I don't remember because I didn't stay that long there. But I know that there was gas chambers and I know th ey wouldn't just sit and not do anything. Q: And the people, the other prison ers who were there when you arri ved, they looked pretty much like the people at Auschwitz? They were thin and sick? A: Not everybody, not ever ybody because it depended on the length of time. That ha d a lot to do, it depended on the physical strength of a person. Some were , not just _______ pe ople but they were 40 fortunate they didn't get sick because if you got sick it's the end. I don't remember Ravensbruk (ph) in as many details but I know it was, the people there was more Polish people in Ravensbruk (ph). A lot of Polish people an d some were a little older too. So it seems like they allowed older people maybe more there to come. Q: So then they took you to Malchow? A: And they took and brought me to Malchow. And I came there with Binna too. A nd there, to my recollection, there was no gas chambers anymore. We still were treated badly, we still had little food. The only good better thi ng was, and we went every day to work, and the conditions were horrible. The only better thing was for me pers onally, for Binna, that we didn't work outside. Because outside, winter or summer, without clothes, the proper clothes without. That was, and we worked inside and we, there I re member exactly what, an ammunition factory. And I know that they gonna use this ammunition maybe against us or other people so whenever we could sabotage something we did. Q: How? A: How? You know, like if you™re suppose to put it on this way you put it in the opposite. I didn't have any tools or anything to sabotage it but not to do it. And if you could work slower we worked slower, you know, the productions. And we knew, whatever we can we didn't want to do to help the Nazis. To help them to succeed. Q: Was anybody, of the prisoners, kind of organizing this? Sort of advising people what to do? Or you just thought this up on your own? A: With what? Q: With the sabotage. A: That was a pretty veiled conception. We all wanted all the time but what could we do? We couldn't. In Auschwitz I coul dn't, what could I sabotage? Q: But here did people talk about it? Did they , when you were new ther e did people who were already there make suggestions or you just figured it out? A: Some word would get out and some we saw othe r people doing it. It wa s not discussed, we were afraid to talk. You know, some body, you never knew who can hear us or something. But we saw that whenever we could, not to do properly or something, then we did it. If it would be, I don't know. Knowing myself, I don't know , if I had opportunity to damage the Nazis, that I don't know if I could do. But the things that helped them to kill people, that I did with good conscious. Q: And enjoyed doing it? A: Not a question enjoyed, but almost felt like a responsibility. It fe lt that, they used everything for destruction, you know? People can be creators or destroyers of life. Ever ything can be used for good and evil. That is the education, I was dreamin g about a formal educatio n but I tell you, there is no substitute for personal experience. And what th is experience in the concentration camp taught me no professor, no text books, no school could teac h me. Because there you had the consequences of your action. When, l earning, book learning is important but it doesn't have consequences. It's not the same thing. It's one thing to read about slavery than being a slave. It's one thing about losing, if somebody lost a family, than losing your own. Same thin g about suffering, about believing from that my ancestors were in Egypt, its different when you go _________ on yours. Then you know. And then some thing happens inside you. De pending on your attitude. You become either bitter or better. My mother's last words were not to become bitter and hateful and not to let them destroy, and I realize this now. Th at hate is the most destructive thing. Q: What else can you tell me about Malchow? 41 A: Well I can tell that Malchow? I just felt everyday, everyday wa s like you want another lease on life. I know that the worse the condition got the longer it took. We tried to enco urage each other again, maybe tomorrow, don't give up, hold on. That was like a __ _________, don't give up. Don't give them the victory, don't give them the final victory. And we just went, we knew we were trapped and we were hoping for a mi racle. And not knowing if its going to happen. It just went on. Worked and another day, another day, not knowin g what's going to happen. Q: Now at this point did you have a little bit more information about the war? A: No. Q: Still? A: We didn't have contacts with anyone. From 1942, until I came to concentration camp. Actually from the ghettos we knew nothing, until I came to the ghetto, before the ghetto I could still hear rumors or something but nobody, we didn't have, who could tell us ? The only people that we saw when I was in concentr ation camp is the in mates and the Nazis. Q: I just figured that maybe at this point you might have some se nse that you had been moved into Germany . . .? A: No I didn't because I didn't know. Because, I had been told not to build, not to assume. An assumption is different from a fact. So I didn™t kno w, so I didn't make any a ssumption. I just hoped and prayed and trie d to hold on for as long as I could. That's all. Q: How long were you there? A: I was there until I was liberated on, during Passover, April 26, 1945. Q: What happened? A: What happened? That's an interesting story. I woke up one morning. No __________. Commotion. And then the Swedish Red Cross came to save us. Not ever ybody. They took out mostly those who were sick and by that time I was pretty sic k. And Binna and I, and a few other people, there was a girl, Franya Gilman (ph), sh e was also on our truck. And ironically, being deceived by the Nazis about this, Red Cross. When I saw this Red Cross I was afraid to go up. But you know, people convey messages by words, by their em otion, by their body language. And those people didn't seem like Nazis. Firs t of all, they didn't wear the unifo rms. And I felt th at this is not, but at first there was fear to go up. But, so they took us on the trucks. From on the date that I gave you and the war was still going on because it didn't fini sh officially. So a bomb, a part of a bomb fell in our truck and it hit Fran ya Gilman (ph) and Franya Gilm an (ph) had to have her foot amputated. That was already towa rd the end, on the way. A nd from there we traveled from Germany to via Copenhagen. Q: I want to ask you a questio n before you continue. When you say you saw the Swedish Red Cross, where were the Nazi guards? Where were the Germans at this point? A: I didn't see the Nazis. I don' t know what's happened to them. I didn't se e anybody. All of a sudden I didn't see, in the commotion, we didn't know, something ______ _______. And frankly I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know if I should be happy or should be unhappy, I didn't know what was going on. But then they came and they helped me. By that time I was pretty sick. And they helped me to come to a truck, they helped me up. And we came to, we traveled. It took a whole day. At night I rememb er we were in a barn, in Co penhagen, Denmark, Copenhagen. Q: Did you take a boat? A: No, no. By bus. Not bus, by trucks. Trucks also. But not such a, not with Nazis anymore. And I didn't know what to think, I fe lt sick and I didn't know alr eady but I saw from the way they touched us because the Nazis never would t ouch us because we were full of lice and ________________. And those people seemed to be kind and we came Denmark. So we stayed 42 over night in a barn. And after th at they brought us to Lund, Sw eden. A univers ity city, to a hospital. And I was alive but I ha d no home to live in so the hospital, they gave me my first home after liberation. But before we went in we had to strip again, naked, throw away the tattered concentration camp shift, and we got a bed. And after all those years, nearly six years, I saw myself in front of the mirror. I couldn't speak a lot of Swedish, or unders tand. I was stateless, homeless, penniless, jobless. Unlike my non-Jewish fellow su rvivors, I couldn't go ba ck home to my family, to my relatives, to my friends be cause Jewish home, Jewish famili es and Jewish communities were destroyed. I had no one left, to he lp me, to love me, to wait for me, or to miss me. But I missed terrible, everybody. And I remember the shock I got when I saw myself for the first time in the mirror. I didn't know myself. I didn't see myself all those y ears. And it was no sign of womanhood. Another thing, during this Auschwitz I didn't get my period. Until this day, I don't know the reasons why. That was malnutrition or wh ether they were putting something in the food? I would suspect its malnutrition. And I didn't know if I am going to be like a normal woman. And when I saw myself in the mirror, I started to scream. The nurses di dn't know what's happened. And I didn't know how to explain. [end of side 1 of tape 4] Anyhow , I, it was a coin cidence because I was born during Passover and I was liberated during Passover. And I had less, I had more on the day when I was born than the day of liberation. Not a tangible shred was left of my pre-war childhood world. Not a single do cument, not a family an nual, not a photograph, nothing. And the Swedish people in the hosp ital were very kind. Very, very kin d, very caring. And to me, if I didn't get beaten that was already a luc ky day. Because then I started to realize I didn't know anything what was happen, with Hitler, I didn't know what's Germany, I didn' t know how the war is. I was away from the war for nearly six y ears, not having any contact, isol ated from the whole world. Not reading, not knowing anything. I only knew what I sensed, what I felt and what I, by comparison. And I talked to myself and I started to realize how one person can make a difference. This was Gentile people and this was Gentile people. One destroyed so many of my people, the other saved them. And I started to understan d many, many things. Not immediat ely, because in the beginning I was too sick to think and it was lonely. Binna fort unately survived too. At what point I realized . . . Q: That you were actually free? A: When I was with the Swedish Re d Cross. Then I started to real ize, when we were going, when we came to Copenhagen and I saw that they treat us , it was like between night and day, the contrast. They treat us kindly, the others treate d us cruel. They took care of us. Q: And you felt you were able to trust them? A: At first I was afraid to go because I didn't know . What th e Red Cross represented to me destruction of so many people at first. But then I didn't see any Nazis. I wasn't, I was naive, I was young but I wasn't completely stupid. And I could see that, the di fference of the wa y they treated us and, you know? They fed us. Q: What did it feel like, being liberated? A: It was a tremendous shock, a tremendous, the transiti on was not, I didn't, all the time I dreamt about being free but the every day struggle to survive, to get through the day, not to be put to the gas chambers, not to be maimed, not to be, health, and to live. It was the struggle to survive so that you couldn't think about all the other things. You were with everybody together. Many people together, we were on the same boat like we used to say. Bu t when we were liberated, and when I came there, I couldn't speak the language. I was 19 years old. I couldn't understand a word of anything. A stranger in a strange world. Not having anyone. And all of a sudden, in the beginning right away I didn't even think so much. I was too sick, too tired, the shock was very much. But then the very 43 first time, I will ne ver forget, but this was late r, but I'm sharing now an experience when I was the first time, or maybe I should go when I come to it. Q: Okay. A: I was in the hospital there. I was getting good care. The contrast was a sharp contrast from the way the Nazis treated us here. An d I remember one thing I was thin king, if this is, I remember I was seeing the differences because I always had th e ability because I was crea tive to compare. I said, "This is Gentiles and this is Gentiles." So good and evil, no one has a mono poly on it. It has more to do with th e _____________. With who you are as a human being. What you believe about yourself, about God and about others . That effects your behavior. And therefore, I realized even more what my mother's last words, don't become hateful and bitter, don't let them destroy you, I realized what tragedies and hatred is. And the more the Nazis tortur ed me, the more I was determined never to become like them, to view myself through their eyes . And here I saw kind people. I had a very, very wonder ful memories. Very, very grateful to the Swedish people, the way they helped me. They helped me to get on my feet. I have nothi ng. I came in, like I said, I had more on the day I was born. Here I went in the hosp ital, I came in nude because they couldn't allow this filthy dress to come in this here, the firs t thing, we came in and took the showers and they helped me to bathe, covered, nurse me back to health. And for this I will be always grateful because I learned not to take anyone or anything for granted. Because its very easy to lose everything. And we stayed in the hospital and then, I think I gave you all the dates, right? Q: Well I don't know . . . A: Otherwise I have everything, I have it all written down. Q: I don't know how lo ng you were in the hospita l, I just know that you arrived in Lund on April 28th. A: Right. Because on the 26 th I was liberated. On the 27 th I was in Copenhagen. The 28 th I arrived. And at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything. What is it? Who is responsible? And basically what I was interested is, in the beginning, to regain my health. I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth, health is important because if yo u™re sick and you are alone, you ca nnot do very much. And I was very much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me. So I needed to become my own parent and start taking car e of myself. Of course, Binna and I were still very devoted and very loyal to e ach other and we were each other's family at the time. And I was there in the hospital, I got very good care. I al so was always fortunately a good student and always loved language, words. I always r ealized the power of word s, so I was very eage r to learn Swedish. So while there, I started, they were very kind to me , they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn a little bit. And to recover. And I was in Lund, Sweden until May 7, 1945. From there I was sent to Dod-ug-stup (ph) in Sweden. It's called Do d-ug-stup (ph), it's ____ ________ you know? And this was DP Camp, which in Swedish is called _________ _____. On Rinks-vagen (ph) 20 B, that was the address. Now there we were in a quarantine, we still couldn't go out because the people were afraid, if we are, if we d on't carry any diseases or, so we we re not treated badly, in fact we were treated very nice. However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 __ ______, which is like 50 cents here, for pocket money. And we started, the pe ople from the town came to the, there was also a fence, but was not barbed wires, it was not electrocuted wires, and we would come to the fence and they looked. Some came and we would give them someti mes the money and ask them to buy little trinkets for us. And there was a couple with a young son, must have been ma ybe early 20's, and with the few words that I coul d speak we made contact. I already recovered a little bit, looked a little better. And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of 44 me that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that when I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with him. And that was the firs t date of my life, okay? So I was very excited and anxious. I didn't know how I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years. I didn't have any experience in dating an d mating. I went out with him. It was a very, very painful experience for me. Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a compliment, you don't look Jewish. And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart. Here I suffered so much an d I'm not Jewish? And again, he doesn't s ee me as a human bei ng. Yes, I'm not denying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who I am. Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to be Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this. It hit me so hard, and I don™t believe he meant it in a bad way, in a malicious way. He wa s a kind person. But fo r somehow he reminded me who I am, not that I ever for got it. And I said, "Good-bye." Excuse myself with tears in my eyes and I left. And I made a decision. Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish because I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family. I cannot do it to my family or to my people or to myself. And in our camp there, in the DP Ca mp, was a woman which was called, we called her ____________ _____, means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is the Rabbi's wife. So sh e was the Rabbi's wife and she was orth odox and she took a great interest, she wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish. So she took us, she told us there is a camp that she wanted to take us. Also, we were not still comp letely free to go. A kosher, a camp. It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much the kosher because in the concentrat ion camp I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be with Jewish people. Q: The DP Camp was mixed? A: The DP Camp was only Jewish, but when I we nt out, and he tells me this here, I was too wounded yet from the whol e experience. Maybe if he would say today I would laugh it off, it wouldn't even have mattered to me this much. But at that time, I wanted to be accepted for who I am because I realized by that time , if I cannot be accepted for who I am surely I will not be accepted for what I am not. So I wanted somebody to a ccept me for, it's not that I had anything about a Gentile or anything, but I wanted to be, I needed to be among my people who are Jewish in order to know that I don't, shouldn't be to ld you don™t look Jewi sh, or be accepted for who I am. So I volunteered to go to the camp. An d on July 10, 1945 I le ft ____________ and I went to Hel-shinfel-hol-it (ph), this is what the place called. However, there was something which was troubling me. I wanted Binna to come too. I didn't want to separate. I t hought of Binna as my extended family. The Rabbi's wife said, "I tka, I don't want to sepa rate you from your friend, but I can't take her. Not now at least. Because I cannot make exceptions." And she was three years older so she could no longer go. But sh e said, "I give you my word that afte r a few weeks, I will bring her too. But not right now because then I ca nnot give __________ about this." So I decided to go and I told Binna that I'm going to tr y to make sure that she comes later. And the Rabbi's wife certainly kept her promise and she brought Binna there too. Q: Now I have a question about actually both of these camps. A: The DP Camps? Q: Right. Because I'm curious wh o organized them and supported them? And also, what sort of activity went on in them? They were trying to, I think, restore people. Were there family tracing services? Did they have religious services? In these DP camps? A: In the first camp there was ha rdly anything. There was just th e emphasis on restoring us to health. Even when I came there, I was not physically that strong yet. So the emphasis was on 45 restoring, to get us used to a normal life, if you can call it nor mal. And so there was not much, we rested basically. We didn't do very much. It wa s more recuperating. It was like a convalescent home you would go from a hospital, that sense, except better becau se we were already, we were not invalids. Q: Any religi ous services? A: No. Not at that point. Nothing yet. At that point it was just plain start putting us a little in the, now when I came to Hemshed (ph), we observed strictly the Sh abbat. In fact, Mr. Pound (ph) was the name of the __________ and he could only speak Swedish. He was the, in Swedish was the ____________. This was like the manger, like the, whatever you call it, when somebody is in charge of. He couldn't sp eak a single word of other language, ju st Swedish. So he asked, "Is there anyone who can speak Swedish a little?" _______ __________________. I learned quickly the language. While I was there, I wa s always with the dictionary and trying to learn the language. So he, I became his helper in the office. I had no traini ng to be in an office and I wasn't asked to do any office work. My job consisted ba sically, translating. If somebody came in an d needed something. We got sheets and pillow cases and things like this from there, so we needed to change them, I would be in charge of this here. If somebody, basically helping him translate and do duties like this but no office work because I had no training in this here. Q: Who supported these camps? A: I have no idea. At that time I didn't know, I was still not having, I was in the world already, in the normal world but it wasn't yet a normal life for me, it was not. So I would rather not say and tell you something which I have no kn owledge. But I know it must have been, I don't know. Now I'm asking, I'm glad you™re asking t hose question because maybe I'm goin g to ask around to find out. Q: It may be _______ ___, it may be International Red Cross. A: Yeah, it could be somebo dy, maybe the Red Cross or maybe the Swedish . . . Q: Or the World Jewish Congress, or . . . A: Yeah, somebody. Bu t who? I don't know at th at time. But we had good meals. It was in a very nice place, physically it wa s a nice place, nice surroundings. A lot of nice gr eens and it felt good. When we came there we didn't have anything. Everybody got a suit case, the same kind, and a change of clothes next to what we were wearing. And sheets, pillow cases, soaps, towels, this we got from there. And I was working th ere and then at one point, I start to feel that I no longer want to be in collective life. I want to start a life on my own because when its co llective, it has advantages, but it has the disadvantage. You don't develop an id entity as much. I needed to start a field, build a life. So Binna and another girl, Regina Shapiro (ph), who was there also, we were assigned to go, we got our first job. And this, I didn't have any, I was 19 years old. I had no marketable skills and only seven grade of public school and a few grades of Hebrew school. So I didn't have, I had to take whatever job they would gi ve me as long as it wa s respectable. And on November 18, 1945 I left, Binna Gold-gramp (ph) and Regina Shapiro (p h) and I left and we we nt to a _____________, it called Redland-da (ph) , _________________ _______________, you know, not so far from Bar-oss (ph). At that time I didn't know where its located. And Binna saw that we we re, I mean Regina saw that we we re like sisters and she was all alone so she asked us if she want s to be with us. And I said of course. So we went to work. Q: You had complete freedom to leave when you wanted to? A: Yes, at that ti me we could leave. That was because when I came there in __________ was in July and we went on November 18 th, so by that time, yes, we could leave. Of course, a lot was still lacking to my complete health and everything el se, but I was ready, I wa nted to assume a job. 46 Q: Let me ask you something, did you think ther e was a chance that maybe some of your family members had survived? And did you think about going back to Poland? A: Not once. I knew that they didn't. I knew th at my immediate, when you say immediate family, doesn't . . . Q: Not immediate family but you had a lot of cousins and . . . A: I didn't go to Poland. I didn't have the means, I didn™t have the strength, I didn't have the knowhow, I didn't have the money, I didn' t have anything. I just stayed, this is why later, towards the end, I'm going to just make a su mmation and you are going to see wh y I realized that, I'll talk about this later because then its going to make more sense than now. Any how, so when we went to work here, we came, that was my first job. Free dom by choice. Until that date, whatever I did is where they sent me, even to go into _____________, to the kosher _ __________, the DP camp. I don't know if we didn't call it, we called it ______________ . I didn™t even know th at it exist, DP camp, so I was still cut off of the wo rld. I had no communication because I wasn't on my own, I didn't have any radio, I didn't have, you know those things, papers and things. I couldn't read too well yet to be able to understand, so it was pretty tough still. And when I came to _____________, on my first job I had a very traumatic experience. I came willing to except any job providing its respectable. I was determined, if I survived Auschwitz with dignity I will not, I was determined on three things not to give up, on my life, on my ________ ___ and on my freedom. Because I realized without it life is not worth living fo r me. And I came there, there wa s basically a very tiny village. There was a sanatorium for children with TB. And most of the inhabitants there, I don't know how much the population, were people who were elderly people. Single, elderly people. There was very, I don't think there was anyb ody my age there. But at that time I didn't think about those things. I was just grateful a nd why I accepted the j ob also because it was room and board and I would still get paid a little. And I need that to have because that was, I didn't have a home still. I didn't have an apartment or anything on my own yet. Q: How did you find out about this job? A: Mr. Pound helped me out. Mr. Pound liked me a lot. In fact, he said to me, we got to know each other and he liked me a lot and he said, "Itka, if th is doesn't work out you come back to me. I have a wife and children a nd we'll take you in until you get on your feet." He was very nice. He was not interested in me as a woman, he was interested as a human be ing, to help me. He saw me as a homeless child. And he offered, but I was determined to make it on my own. And we went there, and the general boss was a very nice woman. She would some times invite me for a walk, to go with her, she would help me a little with Swedish. Anyone who didn't help me was nice to me then, you know? The comparisons, you know? Tha t's what I said, when you heard me saying a reference with which to compare. And she took me into the kitchen, assigned me to work in the kitchen. In contrast, the woman who was the manager of the kitchen, she was the general manager. The woman who was in the kitchen for no apparent reason hated me with a passion. From the moment she brought me in. Why? I have no idea and it doesn't surprise me . Half of the world hated me, that I didn't care and I survived, so I didn't worry about it anymore. However, she assigned me to her and one day the general boss said to me, "Make the sandwiches." As soon as she left, she would say, "Scrub the floor", or do something that was not as easy or as good as the other job. But I figured, I came here to work and I'm going to do what they tell me until I'm able to get on my feet and then I'll see. And I worked there and I got pa id, not too much. And Bi nna, Regina and I shared one room and we got room and boar d. One day was my half a day off and I was going to leave and they burst from the kitchen, made like "Don't go!" And all of a sudden I had a flashback from concentration camp and I was getting nervous. And I very politely ask, "Why not?" "There are still 47 dishes", she answered. And I said, "There will always be dishes in our hospital, but it's my half a day off." Because I was thinking, if she would have asked me I would have gladly stayed. Because then I have a choice. But when I'm ordered I have no choice. And if I acce pt it once, the beginning is the most important, than I'm going to have to do it all the time. And I'll lose my freedom and I'm not ready to, after Auschwitz , never again will I give up my freedom willingly. Q: Were you afraid to say no? A: Nope. And I marched out. Afte r Auschwitz I'm not afraid of anyt hing. Just to do something to disgrace myself or my fa mily. Other things I'm not afraid. What can scare me after Auschwitz? And as soon as I walked out, and I came to my room, this so-ca lled good manager comes in and she says to me, "Itka, I heard what's happened. But would you do it for me? Go back?" And I had mixed feelings. The heart said one thing, the head said another. But I went back. Walking on the way, everything in me revolted. I said, "I'm sorry, I can't do it." I started to cry and I run back in and I didn't go in. I had been ta ught as a child that ne ver make serious decision, long range decision when you™re under emotional strain . So I told myself, I said, suppose I left? Where am I going to go? I have no home. The only option is to go to Mr. Pound and I don't want to do that. To be a burden for them. What future is ther e for me? It also mean t to leave Binna, to se parate from Binna. Because I didn't dare ask her, co me with me, when I have nothing to offer. Not a place, not an apartment, not a job. So I said, no, I can't do it. So I went to the go od boss and I told her how I feel about it, and I said, "Listen. I have no home and no place to go. But I am a survivor of a concentration camp. I got so much abuse that I promised that I will never allow anybody to abuse me again or give up my freedom. So I will gladly stay because I don™t have any other place to go. Give me any job. I d on't mind scrubbing toilet. Job doesn't sc are me. I was working carrying stone and things. But I want to be tr eated with dignity. If somebody wants something from me, let them ask. And if I can I will gladly gi ve, but I don't take orders anymor e." And she said, "I'm sorry. I would gladly do it but she has been working for me for 36 ye ars. I can't afford to lose her." After that I had no longer to think. So I figured, so again not justice. It 's just for conven ient for me. At that point I said, whatever is involved, whatever risk, I must take it. I went in with tears in my eyes, I said good-bye to both my friends. They didn't offer to come and I didn't ask them. At that time I didn't even consider, I didn't even, now I am thin king, how come I didn't offer to come Binna? I wouldn't let them anyhow, but they didn't. You know, everything went so fast. And I picked myself up and I went. Like Buncho (ph) the Silent. Went to the world with no one, an orphan, with no one to care. And when I ca me to the train, they asked me where do you want to go? End of Tape 4. 48 Tape 5 Q: At the last tape you were getting ready to get on a train for somewhere. A: Somewhere. And when I came to the train, running not wa lking, because I want to make the train. I didn't have too many belongings to take with me, I didn't have very much. And I didn't even have time to buy the ticket at the office, at the st ation, but I boarded on the train. And the conductor asked me, "Where are you going?" I said, "To the nearest, largest city." Because I didn't know Sweden at that time, I ha dn't been around yet. So he said, "Boss (ph)? Boss (ph), Sweden? You know Boss (ph)?" I said, "Okay." And that's where I learned. When I came into Boss (ph), Sweden, I did not know a single s oul. I had no home. And all of a sudden it dawned on me. Where am I going now? Now I am completely alone. No family, and not even frie nds. My two friends are also without me. Where am I goin g to sleep? What am I going to do? And I walked quite a while, mostly I was completely oblivious of time, I didn't know, and in desperation, when I started to realize my situation, that I have nothing. I have no money. I have no home. I'm a homeless person and I'm all alone. Even as bad as it was in concen tration camp, I knew this is where I'm going to sleep at night. Here, I don't have anything. And I must admit I was concerned. And all of a sudden I looked up to Heaven and I found myself praying. And I remember exactly what I said, inside myself. Dear God, I am all alone and I am helpless. I'm in your hands. Guide me. I don't want to do something to disgrace myself or my family. And I had been walking, I don't know how long, and then all of a sudden I though t that I hear somebody saying, "Yit-cola." I said, am I losing my mind? I'm hearing voices? And again I hear rep eating, "Yit-cola." And I look around and a girl from concentration camp recogniz ed me. She lived in Boss (ph). And I tell her my story and she said, "Don't worry. We are concentration camp survivors. We can share whatever we have. Come up." And I stayed overnight. She directed me how to go to the unemployment office, the next day, and I went. They asked me, did you work before? I told them, yes. Why did you leave? I said, "I tell you the truth, there's no young people. And I wa nted to start a new life. There was nobody for me to associate with." Which was not a lie. But that was not the only reas on because eventually I would have left anyhow. But it didn't dawn on me. She asked me to come back, that she's going to check out my story. Because I wasn't used to telephones yet because I didn't have a telephone. And she checked out the story and when I came back, she asked me, "Why did you try to protect her?" And I said, "Listen. I didn't leav e, I'm not going to gain anything by making her look bad." You know, my manager from the kitchen. "I just don't have a future there. And I left for this reason, but I also eventually would have left anyhow because there is no life for me." And I told her a little bit, not much, but I told her that I have two friends who stayed there and I want to be with them, can she find a job for me, for them too? And she did f ind me a job. Howe ver, in Sweden was a custom. That you only, if you worked for somebody they provided you with an apartment. You paid for it but if you stopped working you no longer could use that apartment. So I went to work and, when I had already a job for the three of us, and an apartm ent, I got in touch with my friends and I brought them over. With Regina it didn't work out too well because there was, two is okay, four is okay, three is a little part in our relationship. Because Binna and I, except for underwear, shared everything. Even after we were liberated. It wa sn't mine and yours. Mo ney, time, work. She felt better if she did for me, if I did be tter I did for her. So we were like sisters. Regina wasn't, she was more, she was a nice girl but, like, this is mine, this is yours, and we we re not accustom because even in Auschwitz we shared. So we decided that she's going to have for hersel f a room. So we were on the second floor, ______ _____ was also a little room. So Binna and I shared one room, she shared another room. In Sweden, the custom was the dinner wa s not in the evenin g, it was during lunchtime. Since I was brought up in Poland and there was no ready-made foods and everything, so 49 I was still accustom to do, I knew a little bit how to cook because when I was at home I used to help my __________ and my parent s, you know? Chop this and . . . so I knew th at my mother tried to teach me everything , what she could, and I would, we woul d make meals togeth er. And every day somebody would go take turns, one day Binna would go and warm up the food a little early and I did, I had a day when I didn't feel so good she would help. We were really devoted to each other. And one day, I was walking home from work and I was rushing. I was always very fast and energetic. And bingo, I'm on the ground. And I fe el that from the el bow, from the back, somebody's helping me up. I turn around. And it was a man. I thanked him and he starts talking to me and he notices that I have an accent. And we start talking and he had an accent too and we found out that we are both survivors of the Holocaus t. And he tells me that he lives on the same street, he asked me where I lived, I told him, the same str eet. But he lives in a hotel and I was, I got a small apartment. He helped me home and he tells me that his father was, not a ___________, but you know like a self-mad e _____________, ____________. There used to be a lot of people like home-made remedies and he was going to clean up my knees and bandage, I was still, even though I went through Auschwitz, but I sti ll was not the kind of girl that would let him see my knees, you know? So I said, no thank you. And I warmed up the food and offered him some food. And he said it smelled nice and everything, and he said, "Oh, I would gladly pay to have a meal like this." And I said, "I don™t run a restau rant. However, if you want to have a home-made meal, during the week we work, I don't have the ti me, but on Sunday you're welcome. Binna and I is going to be home. You can come up and have dinner with us." His name is in Yiddish, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph), now he called himself Abe. And Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) started to come. I don™t know how I should call it, to date me? But he would come constantly visiting. Showed a great interest in me. I liked him very much as a friend. Very lo yal, well devoted, caring. But I didn't have any feelings for him otherwise. And he was coming to our hom e for almost a year. Now, at that time, they sent to Sweden, when we came to Sweden, all the women were there. ____________. There were other women from Swed en too, that were surviv ors. But the men they sent in other places. So there were only two men in our city. So there was no prospect for somebody to fi nd, you know? So everybody, Binna and everybody else is saying, "Itka, you're so lu cky. You have a man who likes you so much." And, I don™t know, I never talk ed with him about love because I certainly didn't love him. I loved him as a human being, as a good pe rson, but no otherwise. And I remember that Binna said, "Oh, I would be luck y to find a man like this." And, "Why don't you marry him?" And I said, "You like him, you marry him." Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we actually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters who live in America, who survived. I don™t know where, I don't know too much abou t those things. And they send him a visa. And I co uld have gone with him to Amer ica but I did not want to go. Because I said, I'm not going to nega te myself in any way. If I'm going to marry someone it's going to be somebody who I have deep feelings for. Love not only as a friend but as a ______________. And anyhow, one time, Avru m Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to our apartment and he tells me, he invites me to come to his apartment. I got so angry. I said, "After knowing me so long don't you know I'm not the kind of girl that doesn't go to a man's apartment?" You know, we were brought up, you had to be a virgin when you got married, it's not like toda y, you know? And he said, "Shasha, I'm not just inviting you. I'm inviting Binna too and there are going to be other people." And I didn't know at that time yet what 's, and I came. And this was ei ther June 24, 19 46, yes, it was already 1946. June 26 or, I think it was June the 24th in 1946, and I come to the party and as I come in with Binna, there are lots of guests, and I didn 't know that this was the party for his, farewell party, good-bye party, bon voyage party. He was leaving for America. And as I come in a man sits 50 there and as soon as I look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes room and says to me in Polish, "Please sit here." And I sit down next to hi m, and from the first moment, I care deeply about him. And I started to get worried, wh at about Binna? And he, I found out later that Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from the same hometown and the man that this man came with was also from the same hometown. From Bell-hot-off (ph), Poland. They'r e all survivors and they knew each other from home, they went from __________. And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men. And he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am no t going to get involved with him so he said to his friend, "If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you." Because he considered me to be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man. And the person that I met there was Rockmi el Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband . And after, and he ask me can he take us home. So I said to him, "You came with your friend. Why do n't you invite him too and we'll go together?" Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make ______________, you know how _______________is, to be the matchmaker. And he sai d, "Okay." And they want to go upstairs and I said, "No, it's too late. After a certain hour nob ody comes to our apartment." So he said, "Promise me that you're going to wait fo r me." He worked in sh ifts from morning until 2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00. That I'm going to wait. He got a job and the other man was _____________ ____________, which turned out later to be Binna's husband. And he said to come, will we wait for him? And I agreed. Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and ___________ ____________ started to date Binna too. And on e time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, "Do you know a girl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?" And I said, "By sight I don't kno w much about her. I just know she's a pretty girl. That's all I know ab out her, from sight. Why are you asking?" And he tells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another city in Sweden, and he asked him to meet his sister. He wanted to make a match. He didn' t tell me at the time though that he gave him a letter, he really wa s trying to make a match. So I said, "Why don't you go?" And Binna kicks me under the table, she said, "Are you crazy? You're going to send a cat for __________. You like him so much and you' re going to send him to anothe r girl?" I said. "Yes. If he likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later." And she didn't like that so she sent ____________________. He came back and he said, "Now we can get engaged." So a week later, after I met him, I was engaged. And on Ju ly 13, 1946, before Avrum Sc hmol-lev-itz (ph) left to go to America, we had a do uble weddi ng. Binna married Me ndal Crook (ph) and I married Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph). That was the happiest and the most tragic day of my life. Happy because obviously I love my husband, we loved each other. But he is the sole survivor of a large family. He was one of seven. Only one sister died before the Holocaust and the rest of his family didn't survive. And I was the sole survivor of my family . At least he had three __________ at his wedding. I didn't have one single person from my hometown. One singl e person who knew me. My family. And I remembered that when my, when we lived in Check-hon-o ff (ph), we used to, I mentioned before that we were kosher, so we would buy chickens, ducks, geese. And from the chicken feathers we took to the r itual slaughter and then they would pluck, it wasn't ready-made like here, so all the other feathers they threw away. But from the geese and from the ducks, they would save it. The down. And this was suppose to be for a trousseau, for Yit-cola (ph), when she's going to get married. And whenever th ey had a wish, they said they should live to see me under the __________, which means under the canopy. And here I was all alone. I had no one. And it hit me. The only person I had is my husband, Bi nna and _________ , who was my dear friend. ___________, bless his memo ry, he is no longer aliv e, he died several years ago. And at our wedding, I had a borrowed dress. I didn't have an ything. We married deliberately during vacation, 51 the week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week. And on our honeymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup. And for a whole week, the four of us shared. This was our condition in the be ginning. And yet, I've tried to make a go of it and Binna and I made a switch. I shared with her my apartment and Ma ndle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) shared a little apartment when they came from the other city. So Binna went to live where Rockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (p h) and Mendle (ph) mo ved in with me and Binna moved out, in that little apartment. You don't understand? I had an apartment where I shared with Binna before I was married. Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another city and they had a little apartment. So when we got marri ed, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband. And I lived with Rock miel (ph). But there is something that, it™s a curious thing, because I learn a lot from people. When an engage ment we made, I didn't know too many people. So there was only Binna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil ( ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I didn't know from before. One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at that time, I don't know what's he r, she was married, and she was ve ry anxious to get married. She was a lot older and there wa sn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried th at they won't find, and not everybody wanted to marry out of their religion. So anyhow, we had a tiny room. All there was in the room is two single beds, a table and a couple of chairs. I di dn't even have a stove in the room so we went to going from the steps, to go up to the first floor, I took a little, made a little curtain or drape and I bought a hot pl ate. And that's how I cooked. And from the sink that we used. But I was satisfied. So I went out to bring in the food. Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my fiancée when we got engaged, and she says to me, "Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you." And I said, "Why?" And she said, "He's too big a flirt." And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with facts. How would she know what he is, she just met him? She would say he's not attractive, she can see, but how can she kno w he's a flirt? He's never, she neve r met him before. So I just ignored. After we were married, my husband asked me, "Are you good friends?" And I said, "Just met her." But I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement. So he said, "Did you know that when you went out to ________, she invited me to come to her apartment without you?" I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this. And I thought to myself, you see how important is the thing for yourself. To think wh at people say and use your own common sense. This is why I'm telling you the story. Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was working very hard. And Mendle ( ph) told me how hard he's working so I wa s upset about it so I went and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get a better job. And I should get apartment, to get a little bigger apartment. And we were in Sweden and we didn't have anything, we started without anything. But we understo od that it™s a beginning and we worked hard. And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whet her I'll be able to bear a child. Because I didn't ge t the period yet for so long. Fina lly I got the period. And anyhow, we got an apartment. And you know, I'm telling y ou those stories because I'm seeing that all over, in every country and in every religion, and even in every home, ther e can be people who are good or not so good. So anyhow, we ha d an apartment and this, in this house where I had the apartment from this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any children in that home, in that place. Because there were only living people wit hout children. Mostly elderly people. And she pu t in our apartment two beds, singl e beds. And one time, at night, I hear somebody is opening the door. She came to check if we ar e sleeping together, and here I am married. And I always, I don™t kn ow so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as I can remember, I was taught to thi nk for myself and to tr ust myself. And my parents always gave me confidence, you know, that I ha d that, that I was able to trust myself. So I figured, let her say 52 what she wants. I didn't argue, I didn't talk back. And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant, in that place. But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me misera ble. So again, I had to switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were murdered. And here, I had worried for so long, if I' ll be able to bear a child. Here I'm pregnant and somebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child. I need her permission? So I started to look for an apartment to get, to keep the moving again. Anyh ow, when, before, when I moved into another, wh en I was pregnant I moved to anot her apartment. And I didn't know anything about how the human body wo rks. A woman's body. And the doctor just told me the date, when to expect. And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come. All the time my husband and I wa s rehearsing. Where we going to go? How we going to go? Everything. It so happened he had still shift work. And he left in the morning and I woke up and my water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a wate r bag and I didn't know what it was. I just saw it's not somethin g that's, not, that I never had befo re. So I go in, I don't have a friend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask. So I go into a neighbor, to ask her, what does that mean? She said, "I don't know. Go ask the doctor." So she's advising me to go ask the doctor. My husband is not home, I don™t have a telephone number. And here I see something is not right and I don't know what it is. So I take my bicycle and I'm going on a bicycle to ask the doctor. And here my water ba g is broken. And I came to the doctor and they don't let me go home anymore. In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one thing influences the other. An d in the meantime, my husband m eets somebody in the street and they ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby. And here I was a little bit _________. Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the bike to the hospital, that the water bag broke. And he tells he r the story. So she says , "Well, if the water bag broke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live." In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy boy and my husband comes to the hospital and he comes in, I s ee the uncertainty on his face. He holds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion. I said, "What's going on here?" And I was wondering. No congratu lations, no nothing. So distant and co ld? I said, that's not my husband. That's not the man I know. And I said to him, "M istletov, we have a son." And he get so excited and tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouqu et of flowers but he wa s afraid to show them because she told him the baby mi ght not live, and he thought ma ybe it was a mistake. So I'm showing you, why am I telling you this story? I had no experience. I was alone. That when I needed somebody, a mother, I need ed relatives to help me, I had nobody. You know ? And my son was born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born. Two miracles in my life. A son and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream th at my people prayed, the State of Israel. But unfortunately I didn't have relatives to share ________________. And ever since I've been liberated, I couldn't even tell you the time because usually I know, that I feel, I told you ___________ I want to do so mething, but I couldn't put it in word s. I knew that I had to go back one day to Auschwitz. I never said good-bye to my family. I just knew that something is still not finished yet. Anyhow, and I stayed in there. Then after that I was, started to work, no, the first year we had no choice so we had to take, after my son was about a year, we took him to a nursery because we had nothing. We needed to work and I was su ffering tremendously because I was brought up with two loving women at home and a father. And, but I had no choice. And my little boy had an accident. He was acci dentally, you know in Sweden we still didn't have the modern conveniences so we had a stove, a wood-burning st ove, and I was use from Poland, so we washed the diapers and we boiled them. And I even ironed them. And one day, by accident, and I always caution him don't go to the stove, and the hot water sp illed on him. And I t hought that I'm going to 53 lose him so I went with him to th e hospital. I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day she didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's _________. And she tells me, "Your personal life is of no concern of mine." I didn™t say anyt hing and I thought to myself, I'm free physically. Now I have to be independent fi nancially too. And since my husband had shift and got my child with others, and I started to go to fashion design school. And I'll show you, I have the diploma. And I started to work. And when my second so n was born, I no longer had to take him to the nursery. I could be home with him. Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double wedding. She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and sh e miscarried. So she got pregnant again. I was early, she was, it tu rned out that we were, both sh e and I gave birth in the same hospital. Her first child was born on October 1, 1948. My son was born October 10, 1948. And since in Sweden, so many adjustments. In Europe, we didn't know about formulas. So we used to nurse each others children. We were very close wi th each other. Anyhow, then in November 29, 1951 my second son was born, _____ ____. And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work outside but it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewe d everything, from little suits for the children, to draperies, to slip covers, to custom ___________ and I worked ve ry, very hard. But I was happy because I could be home with the family. Then I receive d information that, fr om the _______, that we can go to America if we want to. And I decided that I'm going to talk with my husband, find out how he feels. And we both decided. We're going to go to America. Q: Why did you want to come to America and leave Sweden ? Or not go to Israel? A: They didn't give me a choice to go to Israel. If they would give me a choice I would go. Because they would take care of it, so I had to go again where I was, the reason why I was leaving Sweden is because there wa s no synagogue. There wa s, the few Jews that were there, if any, were assimilated. And I felt I survived as a Jew, I suffered as a Jew, I lost my family because we were Jewish. And orthodox or not or thodox, but I want to give my children a Jewish education. A ___________ education, not just the secular but a Jewish education too. I wanted to be, for instance, when my son had to be circumcised we had to bring a Rabbi from Stockholm. When we want to have kosher meat we had to send it, by the time it comes after three days its no longer kosher if you know the laws of __________. Q: But you could have moved to Stockholm? A: No, we felt there is no, that there, we could have moved, it's not so easy to mo ve. You have to have a job, you have to move, an d you have the circumstances. We had nothing, we started with nothing. So we decided, plus, I ju st felt that too many, you know, in Europe there were too many painful memories. If they would ha ve given me a choice I surely woul d have gone to Israel and that time, but I didn't have a choice. They assigned me to come Philad elphia, so on February 15, 1953 we arrived to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, and we've lived there ever since. During the time when we came here, I knew that we wanted to have a larger family. And we had to make a choice. And I knew that all life, from the morn ing you wake up until the time you go to sleep, you make choices. And I was also taught that every, in every c hoice there are conseq uences and there are lessons. So I had to put my value system to wo rk. And I said one thing, if I have children I don't want them somebody el se to take, I want to be with them. I want to, I didn't have that privilege because it was not of my choice, my mo ther would have wanted me, because one of the things which I remembered, very di stinctly, is that my mother put aside her, she wanted to be an actress but she put away. And the family was always firs t. And other things which I heard when I was home is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriag e and I was very much the child that she wanted so much and I wa s loved unconditionally by my parents. And I felt I don't want to deprive my children of that. So we decided, my husband and I, as long as we can pay our bills, we'll 54 forego luxuries. I would never accept a handout from anyone. We worked hard work. And I will stay home with the children ____ ______. And then in 1956, Nove mber 24, 1956, our son Samuel was born. Again, I rememb er that when I was going to go to America people said, where you going to go with a baby? Or the seas , and how are you going to make out? I always had faith. I said, listen, I'm nursing the baby. So at least until I nurse him he's not going to starve. And then somehow its going to work. You cannot have ever ything mapped out every inch of the way. And we went. It was difficult. I came here. I didn't know a single person in th is country. I didn't know a single word of English. Again we had to adjust, to start anew, to make adju stment, to make work. _____________, I was already skill ed, I was already a fashion desi gner but my husband had no marketable skills. He was working in a knitting factory making nylon st ockings. But he was willing to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a jo b here when we came to Philadelphia, he worked in ___________. By the time he came, the _______ the children were asleep. By the time he came home, they were already, they were still asleep, they were already asleep. And I said, no, this won't do. Because I will never put material possessions above spiritual things, which we need. So I encouraged him to change the job. There was an advertisement. After he worked a few days, they just had a few ________, they let him go. So he was taking any kind of job, th ree, four jobs. But he would never, we never took anything from anyone. And we struggled and th en on February 21, 1964 our younge st son, Michael, was born. And I knew that I made the right de cision, to stay with the kids at home. Because, first of all, it would cost a fortune, four children you have to camp, and I didn't want to send them to camp because I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the country, pi cking mushrooms and my mother showing, making crowns an d put on your head, and singing, and I don™t want them to miss all this here. I felt that to give them love, because I started to re alize that it's the love that I received that I can give to others now. And that you can survive with very little because in Auschwitz I didn't have anything. And after I was married. Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to become barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest in peace, that we're going to go to Israel instead. And to celebrate his ba rmitzvah there. And since I'm an intuitive person, and we decided this al ready, I wake up one morn ing and I said to my husband, "Honey, let's go now." An d he said, "When was this born? Why?" And I said, "I don't know why. I just now feel we should go now." And he agreed. And it was a very good decision. And we went. And for the fi rst time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay? I was eight years old in 1934 when she left. I came there in 1974, with my y oungest son. Ours was always a very close knit family and Uta ( ph) was thrilled. We cried in each others arms. Because she was the sole survivor of her family. She always felt bad that she left. She never coul d come back. An d I remembered my grandmother saying, ___________________. So I was ab le to go back with my son, to meet my cousin Uta (ph). An d there is Israel, there is a coun try now. And she gave him for his barmitzvah a ___________ an d a ___________. And she asked him, just li ke my parents called me affectionate, I called my children affectionate, "Michael, what would you like besides this." He said, "Nothing, I'm just happy to se e you." She says, "No, tell me." He said, "Okay." He wants a little chain, Michael. And I went to Israel, it didn't take long. I rece ive a call. My cousin Uta (ph) went to the doctor, her check up, and either on the way there or on the way home, got a heart attack and died. If I wouldn't have gone then, I already told you what I, my intuition and that I listen to my intuition. And I would not have seen her. Anyhow, Michael was a beautiful young man. He was very successful because he was loved and he had a talent to laugh, a full measure. I remember when he was a little boy. He used to ask me, "How come that we don ™t have family? How come you have a number?" And I told him, and the conversations, I wrote it down and then I made a poem 55 from it. And I remember that when we moved into our first ho me, this is my second home in America. He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother , an elderly lady. He sa id, "Lady, I don't have any grandparents. Would you be my grandmother?" I'm telling you thos e things, that it effected not only us, it effected the children. And she became like his adopted gr andmother. She was very good to him. She lived to be 96. Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was more than fifteen years between him and my older son. So he al most grew up like an only child because they were already in coll ege, ___________. And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely and I said, "Michael, I need a little medicine." And I'll never forget his scared look. And he said, "Ma, are you sick?" And I said, "Oh, not that kind of medicine. I need a hug and a kiss." And he came over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many ti mes, he would say, "Want a little medicine?" And that became our _________ between us, medicine meant a hug and a kiss. And when he was already in college, he would al ways, when I would write to him or call him, I'd say, "Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine." And he said, "I can™t wait to give it to you." And he was very successful because he was loved by many people. He was successful in college. He graduated from the University of Rochester. At age 25 he was already in a wonderful position and he owned his own home and he was successful in every way. He was dating a beautiful girl. And it was, my son Jerry was s uppose to graduate in 19 90, from University of Cornell. And Michael was here Thursday and he said, "Mom, Dad. Be ready. I'm going to come and pick you up. We're going to go to my brother's graduation." That was Thursday. Friday, the police came and told me that I have no longer a son. My son, Michael, was killed. And instead of a graduation party I had a fune ral. He was killed instantly in an automobile. . . [end of side 1 of tape 5] Michael was loved. Hundreds and hundreds of people came to his funeral. Hundreds of trees were planted. He has a garden in Eastside from all the trees that was planted. My cousin, _____________, my son is gone, my family is gone. And I alwa ys wear this, this is my most precious piece of jewelry. Michael. And in my lifetime, I see the de struction of European jewelry. The ________ and defeat of Nazi Ge rmany. And the rebirt h of the State of Isr ael. I remember one time, Michael and I were very, very close because he was the youngest. And he was the longest home. And he was very, very affect ionate and he gave me back what I gave him. And when I lost him I was thinking , at least I was always for him. And his cards, in ou r home we have a tradition, we write home-made cards. And in each card he said, Mom you we re always there for me and you loved me unconditionally. And the kids, when I went now to where they are living, I mean to the World Holocaust Survivors, Michael is no longer with me. He is still with me because he died late. He didn't go with me to the gather ing. And now when I went to th e March of the Living, and I saw the trees and I was thinking. Wh en I went the first time I went for Mich ael's barmitzvah. My husband was still a healthy man, now he's not. How many changes in our lives and how quickly, from good fortune to bad fortune, life can change. And how many times, if we don't have a, if we don't say good-bye to the ones we loved. And becau se of that, I never leave anyone without giving a hug and a kiss, and giving the love and affection. And I feel I did make the right decision, that I gave up everything and was a fulltime mother, wife and friend to those who needed me. After Michael started college and I said to myself, when I can close th e door and nobody will wait for me and depend on me, then I can start paying back the community. In the 1970's I got involved in speaking on the Holocaust. But before that, I was a volunteer in __________ Hospital in the Mental Health Department. I was going as a volunteer to the Great-a-felt (ph) Prison. I was going on ____________. I remembered my grandmother's teaching. Help those who are less fortunate than we are. Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions. 56 A: Okay. Q: Are you okay? Do you want to take a break? A: No it's okay. Q: You sure? A: Yeah. Q: When you came over here, to this country, was it easy for you to make new friends? And to start again? You had to begin again in Sweden. A: When I came here, as I said before without wa nting to repeat myself, I didn't know one single person in Philadelphia. But when I was still in Sweden, when I came to Sweden, it was the same thing. And I'm going to go back something, to Swed en, because the same thing happened here. It happens to be related. When I was in Sweden, and one time it dawned on me, th at if something would happen to me, you know? So alone and ever ything. Nobody would miss me. If I would die, nobody would, it wouldn't be a loss if people don't kno w me. And I decided th at the most important thing is family and fr iends. And I made an effo rt to reach out. I was no longer of being hurt, that I lose somebody, because in life everyone that we love either they will die before us or we will die before them. But not to love is th e greatest loss. Not to trust is the greatest loss. When I came here, I didn't know anyone. When I ma de my son's barmitzvah, the first one, I had over 100 people. And when I make my _________ barmitzvah, I have over 300 people. When I was going to make Michael's barmitzvah, and I start to make the list, we needed 500 people. I don't sa y everybody was a personal, close friend, but they were people who I was involve d. And I said, no, I cannot get involved. I made fo r my friends already now, I _________ in Israel. I find one thing. That the survivors of the Holocaus t here in Philadelphia, we have our, first we were called the Jewish New Americans. Then we changed th e name to Holocaust Survivors. We have a common past and a common responsibility. To remember our personal stories. Because for us the Holocaust is both a personal and a collective Jewish tragedy. It 's a human tragedy. Q: Did you find that, certainly as you were getting started here, that it was easier to be close to people who had also undergone the Holocaust? Or did you readily make friends with other people who hadn't been in Europe? A: First of all, I couldn't make friends with other people until I learned the language. And we formed already 1956, we already ha d here the organization. So we shared a lot together. And we realized that this cannot be just a social organiza tion. We have to work for Israel. We have to remember the Holo caust and to share with others and to teach . But for me, I had and I still have, all kinds of people. If I would sh ow you my telephone book, you will say how can you keep up? Because I made, I didn't discriminate. I feel one th ing, the only criteria that I, that is important to me, is not how much some body has, who he knows, what he knows, but how much he cares. And when a person is caring, and he is a good, decent human being, than I can be their friend and they can be mine. Q: W as it easy for you in the ear ly days here? Before you were going around and speaking about the Holocaust? To talk about your experiences? A: It was difficult then, it's difficult still. However, I don't do only the things which are easy. I do many things which are difficult but they are necessary. And when I was asked, there was here a professor ___________, the late ____________, I mentioned to yo u before. And she is from ____________. And she wrote a book of the Holocaust and she, once a friend of ours from the organization invited about 20 survivors. I didn't kno w what the purpose was, it wasn't like a social thing. And I found out that she wanted to organize, that people should speak on the Holocaust. And I went there and that was the first time that different survivors among ou rselves started to share 57 a little feelings. And I reali zed that there is not, we realized that there is very little in the text books about it. Q: Actually what I'm trying to un derstand is, not so much in a formal way, speaking about it, but you had friends from all walks of li fe, talking in the earlier days here. Was this something that you could talk about? That y ou could share? Did people want to hear about it? A: I never went around and volunteered. Q: Just on a personal basis. A: Okay, but I mean, what happened was that when people saw the number they start to ask me questions. And I answered. I alwa ys, I did the same thing like I di d with my children when they asked about sex. Short question, short answer. Th ey asked me so I answered. And people, not too many people were so interested, they didn't know what it is. And then, a little later, when people started to know about it, especially the Holocaust survivors, realized that in the text book there is very little about the Holocaust. They speak about World War One but not abou t the Holocaust. So we started to form an organization and be involved with th is here. So it was diff icult. Because, to give you one example, wi th some people it was eas ier. Some are more compassionate, some are more understanding an d more curious. Others ar e more involved with thei r own life. So it depends who it was. I had my la te friend told me that someone asked her once about the Holocaust and she started to tell a little bit. She said, "Well, we had that in America hard too. We didn't have any steak." And after that she decide d never to talk about the Holocaust to her. The Holocaust has taught me many lessons. Because before the Holocaust I only had positive experiences. I had no frame of reference with which to compare all the blessings that I have. The blessing of a loving family. The blessing of good he alth. The blessing of having my home. Not to be called all different names. Because I've been called all kinds of names. I've been called no name at all. I've been called, derogatory now, __________ Jewess, which was antiSemitic name. I was called you refugee. You foreigner. All kinds of name. And I feel one thing, that its very impo rtant. Respect for one another. Respect for differences. That we cannot expect everybody to be alike. And that we must, I don't want to use the wo rd must because that sounds dictatorial. It's important to protect our human rights. And just, in the very beginning, with even the smallest incident that's happened. When somebody does not treat you right. I have learned to be come a __________ ___. I want to give you an example because that's going to be more. I was invited several years ago to an open house, a barbecue. And the barbecue started beca use there was some people who were suppose to come from other cities to o, it was like a big gathering. They started to come on Friday until Sunday evening. We came Sunday. We li ve, it wasn't in Philadelphia. And when we arrived, not the owner but one of the guests greeti ng me with anger. "What's the ma tter? Why so late?" At that time I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is controlling me emotionally. So I looked at him very calmly and I said, "Thank you. I am so glad that you missed me." And he answered, "You know I like you Yit-c ola (ph) ." And I said, "Thank you" again. This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive. He was otherwise a good man, but he had a habit of pu tting some people down. And I have noticed that vo lubility illicits aggression in the group, compassion in the kind, and silence in th e indifferent. And this is nothing to do with race, color or religion. It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love yourself because you cannot lo ve others if you don't love yourself . And to care. To know that what we do effects not only us, it effect s others too. Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many times, you know I told you I lik e to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my parents and grandmother made for me. You know ch ildren don't make where to live and what to do, of course I had some. During the Holocaust I couldn't make choi ces about my life. Even after 58 the Holocaust. Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to co me here. But I didn't have many choices. I could say, I come, I don't come, but I c ouldn't say I want to go someplace else because the _________ ___________. So I felt that so much in my life I ha d to live and to do by choices which others made that effected me. And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words. And it goes like this: Four groups of people Dramatically influence my destiny. My late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), Poland Who knew me and loved me and em powered me with positive energy. Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being bor n Jewish and in one, single day Murdered in Auschwitz my entire family. The bystanders, who knew but didn't care. And the Swedish Red Cross, who di dn't know me but liberated me From Nazi tyranny and brought me to a hospita l in _____, Sweden. I am one and the same person. If four different groups of people viewed me differently, And treated me differently, I was loved for who I am And I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am. The more the Nazis tort ured me for who I am The more I was determined ne ver to become like them, But to view myself through their eyes. To the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin. But I am not a number. My number is my badge of honor. Let those responsible for the number f eel ashamed, or whatever they want. I am a proud Jewish daughter. To be born Jewish is neither a crime nor a disgrace, But to starve, torture and murder innocent people For being born Jewish is a cr ime against God and humanity. A crime that has influe nced the entire world. Because whatever we choose to say and do We are becoming partners too. But others are becoming the be neficiaries of our good deeds Or the victims of our evil deeds. We each can make a difference. One person can save many people And one person can destroy many people. Mengelia is responsible for the dead, over 40 0,000 people. On the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Sh indler is responsible for so many lives. From the 1,100 Jews that Shindler sa ved, 6,000 descendents are now alive. Can you imagine how many would be if the others had survived? Therefore, I feel that my first responsibility Is to God To live by the commandments 59 And not to transgress them Because I cannot do evil without becoming evil. The lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm goi ng to become a liar and I'll help him and others. And I know one thing, we live in this world We are responsible for one another. But not in a way to punish each other. So whenever there is injustice and cruelty We need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is. And to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed And not with the oppressor. In the final analysis, without ______________ , all _________, religion and education fails. So we need first to impr ove ourselves because then we make a better world. If you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time. Q: I have a question. Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibi lity for your world . . . A: Our world. Q: Right, but it's the same. Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so that had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned th e birth of the Israeli State. Are there other things that have effected you in this country, lik e the Civil Rights Movement or wars or anything? A: Yes. I feel, do you rememb er there was a __________ who came and he wanted to, here in Philadelphia, to speak in the movies about the Nazis? We went and marched. When there was, we went to speak. Then there was sup pose to be a rally here, Nazis want ed to march here. We went to court, I was among them, and we f ought against it. When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have to be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on somebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, genera lizations, I stand up and I speak up. I said, "I don't appreciate what you said." In fact, one of my dear frie nds who is non-Jewish, who I met through such occasion. Because we were in the _____________, it was a meeting and somebody said something negative about anot her group. And I said, "I really don't appreciate because I know how it feels when people do that." So in small thing. You know, prejudice is very easy because you don't have to give accounts fo r it. You just say it but you don't have to give, you know? And the point is one thing, it's like fire. When there is only one spar k, you can erase it. But if there is a big fire, you have no cont rol any longer. So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily life, in the personal, how we do people. Because usually when a person from one group offends another, sometimes he starts hating or being angr y towards the whole group. So its important to respect each other. It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people worked, you know, wh en there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to re lease them, I was marching. So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I write a letter, I speak up. That's my contribution. Those are th e things which I do. I cannot say, it doesn't bother because it effects. You know, I just wante d to add, the Holocaust effected not just me, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people have lost. They will never become what they had the potential of becomin g. The world will never know how many wonderful people we have lost. Nor how ma ny Nazi war criminals we have gained. Because some of them still live in hidi ng _______________. So what did the world gain? Lose good people and gained crimin als? Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain 60 a criminal. What trade-off is that? So it's important. Even to, in my own home, to my own husband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything, I will always stand by you ____________. But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part of it. Then you have to trade your self in. So there are certain loya lties. In life we need to make choices. We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to sa y no. Because you know, in the commandments there is the ten commandments. It says you shall, you shall not. And another thing how you can put out, you canno t hatred with hatred, anger with anger. Somebody once said in anger to me, I hate you. Because I wouldn't give in to something that was no t moral or ethical. I said, it's okay I love you for both of us. And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you it's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, yo u are stubborn. I said, wh at you call stubborn, that stubborn is what save d me from. Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me. That no power in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own destruction. Because what we do, this is what we become. You kill you become a killer. You cheat you become a cheat. You sa ve somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we know or how much we have, how much we care. Caring is what life is all about. And we have a wonderful group in Philadelphia now, that was in the museum last week. They are called Champions of Caring. High Sch ool students. And this is sponsored by the Holocaust Museum in the Washington. And by the Jewi sh Relations Counsel in Philadelphia. And the ________, also in Philadelphia. And those kids, what do they do? They go and help those who are less fortunate. The sick, the elderly, the disabled. This is what we need to do. You know, the strongest message I can give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's killers. Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission. Q: Would you like to read something? A: Yes. I picked those two poems because, actually there are three poems that I would like to share with you if there is enough time. Q: We'll see. A: Okay. The first one is cal led 'A World That Vanished'. Q: And when did you write these? A: This was written May 8, 1978. A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and breathing it, it's effect ed so deeply my life. Just like a leaf tossed to the wind Separated from its branches and tree Not belonging anymore Liberated but not free Carrying the pain of separation Memories so painful and dear Memories of our world, it use to be A world that is no longer here I still see the Sabbath candles And my mother's gentle face My father is chanting the prayers My grandmother with her white shawl of lace I see my little sister and brother So young and so full of cheer Not yet understanding tragedies and hatred But sensing uncertainty and fear 61 The Nazi boots are marching My world with terror is filled The Holy Scriptur es are burning Children are starved, tortured and killed The ghettos are closing us in What is there for us in store? My world is going slower and slower Nothing is like it was before. The freight trains are taking us on a journey For most it is the last ride My brothers and sisters are burning There is no more place to hide Hitler's final solu tion is sealed We are trapped in a world of Hell I am amazed that I have survived The horrors from the Holocaust to tell And there is another poem, which is called "I Am Not A Number", and I wrote it May 13, 1994. I was trapped in the killing center of Auschwitz Surrounded by barbed wires, gas chambers, smoke and flame The Nazis tattooed a number on my arm 2-5-6-7-3 became my new name They tried to reduce me to a number Dehumanize me day by day But regardless of all their efforts The could not take my self worth away They murdered in the gas chambers my entire family In one single day All my earthly possessions we re so brutally taken away They treated me worse th an a hardened criminal Even though I did no t commit any crime They hated me merely for being born Jewish And starved and tortur ed me all the time. I was only 13 years old when they to ok away from me my right to life But they could not take away my will to live and to survive For nearly six nightmarish years I have endured a living Hell Nevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich And lived my story to tell The third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael. When he asked me the first time about the number. And this was written May 14, 1979. Who wrote on your arm, Mom? Asked curiously my little boy one day I looked sadly at my in nocent child and thought Very carefully what to say 62 The Nazis tattooed this number on my arm I told my son short and plain Why did they do it, Mom? He asked further My God, I thought, how can I explain? You see my child, there was a man Adolph Hitler was his name He was very cruel and hateful And inflicted on people suffering and pain Oh, said he, and ran out to play And I signed with great relief I wanted to protect him for as long as I could From knowing my de ep sore and grief He grew and I could not protect him forever So I answered his questions one at a time He wanted to know why we Jews are hated Did we commit some kind of a crime? No, my child, I told my son, We have not committed any crime Yet we Jews have been vi ctimized and slaughtered By _____________, ______________ and Hitlers all the time Do you hate the Nazis fo r what they did to us? Now I have no grandparents and relatives like my friends The Nazi murdered all our loved ones They have blood on their hands I know, my child, that you too are hurting But hatred and revenge can never restore The lives of those who pe rished in the Holocaust And the precious things we had once before You and I who know what pain is Must never inflict hurt and pain We must try to bui ld a better world So the death of the victim s shall not be in vain This is my message. Q: Did you talk much about your experiences with your sons? A: Yes. But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the Holocaust. I wanted them to know their grandparen ts. Because I felt its important. And as a result, my oldest son __________, a couple of years, two or three year s ago and maybe a little longer, came here to visit. He lives in New York. And afterwards he calls me up and he said, "Ma, I had a very traumatic experience." I said, "What's happene d?" He said, "I was wa iting for the train and I saw a man laying face down across the tracks. A nd I saw from nearby that the train is coming. I didn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide. I had no idea. And I was thinking, what should I do? My mind was racing. On the one hand, I risk my life because I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back. And on the other hand, I thought, what would my grandmother do? My grandmother _______________ _." Because I told him the story how my mother sacrificed he rself and me. And he said, "I ju mped up and I saved him. People 63 had to pull me up." My first r eaction was, how could y ou do something like this ? And then I said, "_____________, when you graduated from Yale Univers ity I felt you achieved something special. But this is something more special . You proved that you are a _____ ______ and that is the highest religion, education and achievement. I am very grateful." Another thi ng, because everything effects, another thing is that wh en he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this country, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child. I once told him, because he asked me also about my experience. I said, "_____ _______, both y our parents are survivors of the Holocaust. We lost everything that was ours. All that we have is our good name. And if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are my child. But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spirit ually. But there is one thing. You do something morally and ethi cally wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name." And I completely dismissed it from my mi nd. When he was an adult alread y and I came to visit. And all of a sudden, he starts telling me, "You know, Mom? Whenever I was going to do something I asked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents? " And thank God, my son grew up to be a very respectable, loving son, husband, father. He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild. She is named after my late son, second name. Her name is Elizabeth Michaela. We call her Elizala (ph). And she was here shortl y before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996. And for the first time, she noticed my number. And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's Day. During the time she learned a little more, sh e grew. And she's playing, busy playing, and she takes a look on my arm and she sa ys, "Barbie, A-B-C's." Because she has a book with A-B-C's and she sensed that this is related. She's only two years old. So it's even effect ing her. For me, for my children, even for my grandch ildren, it's too late. They will never know the joy of having grandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know. But hopefu lly its not going to be too late for others. And I want to finish with a very inspiring story. Remember that I repeated many times that my grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away. In 1984, I received a letter from a person that I didn't even know. Ida Jervis ( ph), _____________, Washi ngton. And I opened the letter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin. I'm named after the same greatgrandmother, ____________ _____________. I was four years old when my family left Poland and I'm sure that you will appreciate this. And I'm looking, she send me a photograph of my grandmother and her son. And I thanked her. Sh e invited me to come and visit. Really not knowing what to expect, a survivor, how I'm going to act? Am I going to be reacting normal, am I being all broken up, or whatever. And I came and there was anothe r relative who knew my mother because they were cousins and she left shortly befo re the war. And sh e's telling me that every year for many years now, they have a ____________ family reunion, because this cousin was ____________ and she came w ith her sister and they started this because people lived in different places. And they invited me to come with my family. We went. From not having any relatives here, all of sudden I had more th an 130, 140 relatives. And until th is day, whenever we can we go for Thanksgiving reunion. We are close. And my cousins speak with price, my cousin, every occasion, my cousins. They have family. So, be cause my grandmother send this picture away from Europe, this picture is now returned to me and I r ealized now I can tell you what you can give away, you still have it. After I lost everything in the Holocaust. My home, my family, my community, my earthly possessions, six years of my life and went thro ugh a living Hell. I fo und out, when I had lost everything material, that I have spiritual things to give. The Nazis hated me but they couldn't stop me from loving people, from believing in God, and from caring and wanting to help. And we certainly have what we give away. We can give up, for over 20 years I've been giving away stories, about the Holocaust, about my family. Many people tell me, I kno w you because your grandmother 64 and parents, like they would be mine. And I still can give away. We can give k nowledge, a poem, love, compassion. What you are doing, to give away typed, to record this here, it's the spiritual things that nobody can take aw ay. And the result, passing them onto the next generations. The result is passing them onto any person, older, y oung, stranger or family. When we do that, then long after we are gone they rema in. Because Anne Frank wrote a di ary. She is gone and her diary is going to live on. And we can always give away kind words and good deeds. No matter how poor or rich we are. How educated or not. And this is what is important. This is the lesson of the Holocaust. Now you understand why I felt it's important to talk about my family. They gave me unconditional love. Showed me, my mother's experience and I, many times when I think, if she could love me so, so much a stra nger, how much more did she love me? And that gives me, makes me feel like I'm worthwhile. And this is very important. Q: Thank you. A: You're welcome. And thank you for your time and effort. Conclusion of Interview.
