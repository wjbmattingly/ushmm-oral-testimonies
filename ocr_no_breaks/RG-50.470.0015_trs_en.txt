they had seen in five years or however long they had been in the camp. It was a very, very emotional and moving thing. The horror of it hit us even afterwards as much as it did as we saw them there. But the the prisoners were well-behav ed, one of the key problems that we had as we entered this camp when others did who they en tered their camp, was the disease problem. We knew that people under those conditions must have been suffering from typhus as well as many many other diseases, and we were told to be very careful and not get too close to them or touch them even though our natural human inclination was to see what we could do to make them comfortable. In some cases they had been give n blankets and K rations and C rations from our supplies to cover up those who were still eh uncovered so to speak. It wa a cold wet day, as I recall, and even with our uniforms and jacket s we were uncomfortable, and you can imagine what the poor prisoners suffered in that same ve in. I talked to a friend of mine from the 493rd field artillery battalion w ho was in one of the efforts moving south parallel to us, Pete Bramble, and he mentioned the fact that his wire truck pulled up to a camp which had evidently not been entered at all, and the first thing they saw were barbed wire fences so they hit their truck, took their carbines and machine guns, moved forward in there and found out what the situation was. Prisoners came up and kissed thei r trousers and one of the most memorable recollections that either Pete or one of those wire crews was that someone stood at the edge of the camp and saluted them which really was an emotional thing for these American soldiers who had never seen this kind of mistreatment of people in their lives. General Allan, the division commander of the 12th entered the camp while I was there,and wa s as shocked as we were to see the realism of what these camps were. And later in the da y, I understand that he ordered that all male villagers from the nearby village, and I can't tell you which village it was because there were several around , but he had them walk through the camp. look at all of the things, from the ovens to the burning huts in the ground to the stacks of bodies, to the living people and he had them bury the bodies the next day that evening in the next day with their bare hands, which they did. I don't recall that they took the women of th e village through the camp, and I can understand why. That evening, we were told, the burgermeister or the mayor of the little village shot him self. Most of the village observers who went through claimed that they didn't even know that the camp was there. We found that difficult to believe because in many cases you could see the wire fences from the village. But we ran into a lot of this denial as we called it as we went through other camps and through that part of Germa ny. All kinds of different incidents occurred. Many people were there at the camp before I arrive d, so mine is a very poignant observation of the camp, but I didn't, I wasn't the first one in, so I don't know what actually happened as the first troops arrived. Sandy: ,,and also of your fellow service men. WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: That is one thing that I did forget. You know, I eh, I'll start with that maybe. Sandy: Yeah, that's fine. WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: OK. Ok. Sandy: Just wait, just a sec. WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: One of the things that was most noticeable was the color and countenance and appearance of the prisoners themselves. I do remember that most of them appeared to me to have almost blue skin, very little circulation, starvation, riding only on bones and no flesh and the stench was awful, the appearance of their eyes was glazed. They couldn't believe what they were seeing, and eh their voices were weak. We did talk to several of them. They were overjoyed, tears were running most of their faces, but these men were in not a normal condition, they were far worse. I would have guessed that the majority of them ranged in weight from maybe 70 pounds up to 80 or 90 at the most. Very few people did we see who weren't pure skeleton with skins stretched over the top. Another very impressive thing about the environment or the ambiance of that meeting was the careful s ilence of Americans, we talked in whispers to each other. And it was almost like being at a wake which it was was many thous, thousands times enlarged. And the emotions the Americans were very very noticeable as we sat there talking to the inmates and among ourselves as well. Sandy: Tell me about the SS? WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: The primary German we saw in this group was an what later turned out to be an SS soldier guard who had changed his clothes into civilian clothes, had a black vest on and we took his picture, which turned out very well. He was standing knee-deep in bodies which were not burning but were stacked up ready for burning. And I would imagine those bodies came up above his knees and he was st anding there talking to himself a little bit, kind of muttering, professing his innocence and he had his head shaved like an SS trooper would. We were told by Holocaust people who got some history on him that he was killed the next day by an inmate prisoner who hit him with a board after months of being mistreated and killed him. So it was just rewards for his wonde rful work for the Nazi Reich. Is that enough? Sandy: Yeah. One other thing. Talk to me about what you thought you and the other servicemen could or couldn't do. WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: As we viewed this terrible scene, I think most of us did think of what we could do to relieve the situation. Our battalion surgeon was with us and he said: Do not feed, overfeed these people immediately. They won' t be able to take it and it'll possibly kill some of them. So we were very careful. We did give them K rati ons with the admonition to treat it carefully and and not try to eat very much at a time. There were already people arriving from some of the rear echelons who took these people attempted to segregate them into those who were in dying condition and those who were a little bit better and so forth and so on. We remember one building was marked contagious dis eases. And of course, we stayed away from that at the moment and later people came in and ma de just triage of what should be done with those people. It appeared to be an enormous problem and it appeared even more so as we learned of the extent of these camps and th e deprivations that the prisoners had undergone during that. Sandy: One other thing that you me ntioned to Diana was the expression on the faces even in death. WILLIAM MCWORKMAN: Yes, eh, the expressions on the faces of the dead people was one of pain, horror, a few of relief, ma ny of them were beaten to deat h, but particularly the grotesque countenances of those who had been put in these long pit housing with a wooden roof over the top and locked the door and then set on fire. You could see them crawling to the edge, you could see a hand clawing its way, trying to claw its wa y out of that place. And you can imagine what kind of a death that might have been. This wa s appeared on all of them. A reaction that I had after I left the camp was that we were so s hocked by the appearance of the hundreds of bodies that were in here, stack of maybe 5 or 6 hundred in one spot, and 3 or 4 hundred in another, was that we were so aghast that I think we spent mo re time looking at that than we did at trying to take immediate care of the those who were liv ing. As I look back on it 50 years later, I would have spent more of my time tryi ng to comfort more of the living and trying to find out if they knew of any of their particular friend who were there and so forth but we didn't do that. We were all so shocked by the .....
