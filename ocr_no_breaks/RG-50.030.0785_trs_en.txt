So was it in the eastern part of Poland , even though it was in the middle? A: No, as I say, in the central part of Poland . But then, in 1932, my family moved to eastern Poland , which was [indecipherable] . The district was Tarnopol . Q: Tarnopol , okay, okay. A: This is the eastern part, which was then overrun by Russians. Q: Okay. We™ll come to that, thank you. Let™s stay with Krulewiec (ph). Since you moved in 1932, you were only a young boy then, but do you have any memories of this Œ of Krulewiec (ph) at all? A: Yes, I have pretty good memories. It was a fairly well organized village, very new, as a matter of fact. And it was close to a village of importance, was Wola . Q: Wola arczycka ? A: Yes. Q: And why was that village important? A: Because all the homes were pretty new. It was a new village, and Œ and as I re Œ as I remember, houses were pretty nice for that period of time. Lot of them were brick, with large lots. Will Œ buildings were quite new. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 5 Q: What was the economy of Krulewiec (ph)? What did people make their living from? A: Oh, I really don™t know very go Œ Q: What did your family make their living Œ A: My Œ my father was a builder. Q: Ah, okay. A: So, he used to build homes, and also larger objects like school, or even he helped to build or renovate a church, a village church. Q: I see. A: So Œ and other people are probably just maybe working in the forest, because there was a forest nearby. So th-th Œ in timber. Q: Was it an agricultural place? Were there many farmers? A: Yes, mostly agricul Œ agricultural, yes. Q: Okay. And do you remember the house that you lived in, or the place you lived in in Krulewiec (ph)? A: Yes, I have some memory of my Œ of the house. It was a fra Œ frame house, a wood Œ wood frame. And Œ Q: Was it also new? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 6 A: Yes, it was ver Œ fairly new. And it had other buildings, like the Œ for Œ for the animals, for Œ farm animals were kept in there, and also the one where they kept grain. Q: So you had a barn, and a stable. You had a barn for Œ A: Yeah, there was a stable, and as a matter of fact, the stable was a brick building. Q: That™s pretty unusual. A: Yeah, it™s pretty Œ a-and I remember there were special facilities for Œ for the animals, whe re every thing was run down, and I mean, it was pretty clean Œ Q: Oh, you mean when the Œ where you could wash down the dirt from the animals? A: Yes, yeah, th-the Œ Q: Okay. A: Yes, it was concrete floor. And of course, there was also this Œ a lot of straw on it, but Œ Q: What color Œ A: Œ underneath there was a concrete floor, and with gutters, so you could wash out Œ wash the area where the animals were living. And of course, you know, th-there was a different Œ the separate par Œ place for horses, also. Because we had cows, and horses. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 7 Q: Did you have any other animals besides cows and horses? A: Well, a Œ I had a nice dog Œ dog, a German Shepherd. It was called Rex. Q: Oh, Rex. A: Yes. Q: That™s such a universal name for a German Shepherd. A: Ah, well, yeah, it was Œ Q: The king. A: Œ very, very good, very intelligent dog. Q: Yeah. Did your father build this place too, since he was a builder? A: No, it was already there, because when Œ when Œ when they Œ when he left his village Œ when he was born, he mov ed into this Œ it was called a colony really, you know. Like the Œ Q: It was a colony. A: Colony. Kolonia , in Polish. But it was a straight street, very straight street, and houses on both sides of Œ of the street. And there was a church, there was a blacksmith there, who was very busy all the time. I Œ I spent some time watching how they were putting shoes on the horses. So, it was interesting to watch. Q: Yeah, for a little kid. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 8 A: And then there were Œ there was Œ well, there were Œ I Œ I Œ a carpenter. There was a big place where the owner was the carpenter, he built furniture and all Œ all sorts of things. So that Œ that it™s Œ that™s about all I can recollect. Q: Well, that™s a lot. That™s a lot. Did Œ A: Yes, and I remember there was a pond at Œ at the end of this colony. I spend some times cat-catching the frogs in that pond. Q: Did your family have land near the house? You kept Œ you kept farm animals, you kept cows and horses. A: Yes. Q: And what were they used for? The cows, I can imagine, for milk. A: Well, the horses were used to toi Œ to work on the farm. Q: So, in other words, you lived on a farm Œ A: On Œ on a farm Œ no, the farm was attached, or the house was built on a farm, because every owner had a lot behind the house, let™s say, you know, a lot of area, where they would raise grain, and Œ and cabbage and potatoes. Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it™s Œ it is in some ways unusual for people to Œ it doesn™t sound like you lived in the middle of an agricultural place, insofar as you had a street, you had both houses on the side of the Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 9 street, and Œ and it l Œ sounds almost like a small residential area, but not a place that™s a farm area. And Œ and Œ A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German extraction. Q: Oh, really? A: Yes, so it Œ it Œ it was even referred like a German colony. Q: Really? A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in there, so the buildings I can recollect, were brick buildings, and pretty substantial, let™s say, you know, there™s Œ they not dilapidated or anything like that, it was Œ I think it was a fairly new colony. Q: Okay. Let™s turn now a little bit to your family. Did you have brothers and sisters? A: Yes, there were four of us, and two sisters. Q: Okay. A: Four brothers and two sisters. Q: Uh-huh. So, can you tell me their names? A: Th-The oldest was Jusef (ph), then Franciczek (ph) Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 10 A: Œ Roman . And there was Maria , Stanislawa , and I was the last, Anthony Œ Antony(ph). Q: S-So you were the youngest child? A: The youngest child, and the difference between them were 17 years. Q: So you Œ you Œ A: My oldest brother was born in 1910, and I was born in 1927. So the difference was 17 years, over 17 years Œ Q: I see. So you Œ A: Œ the family, and I was the last one. Q: You™re the baby. A: In Œ baby, yeah. Q: Were you the favorite? A: I Œ I don™t know. Q: Now you mentioned that your father had come from someplace else, the village where he was born. A: Yes. Q: Does that me an that everybody in Krulewiec (ph) came from someplace else, because it was a new colony? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 11 A: M-Most of people probably came from different areas, from around the villages, because I think it was a fairly new settlement, let™s say, like outside of this larger village, Wola . Q: I see. A: But it Œ it had Œ it™s na Œ own name, Krulewiec (ph), but right now, when I look at the maps and everything, kr Œ kr Œ it™s just Wola . Q: Wola . A: Yeah, which is quite the large village now. Q: So does mayb Œ yeah, maybe it just expanded, and absorbed it. A: Expanded a lot, yes, expanded, yeah. Q: Okay. Where had your father come from? What was his birth town Œ you know, hometown? A: He was born in Charlna (ph), near Lancut (ph). Lancut (ph) is a cci ty. It was probably about 10,000 inhabitants. And it was known because there was a castle, owned by a Œ the Pototskis (ph) family , which i-in Polish history, Pototskis (ph) are well Œ very well known Œ Q: Were they nobility? A: Œ name. Q: Were they nobility? Polish Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 12 A: Nobility Œ Q: I see. A: Œ yes. Q: And was your mother from the same place? A: Yes, from Œ not from the same village, but from the same district. Q: Okay. A: Same Œ maybe like seven kilometers, like five miles, area, you know, that radius [inde cipherable] Q: Okay. Now, what wa Œ now, I didn™t ask earlier, what was your father™s first name, and your mother™s first name and maiden name? A: My father™s name was Jakub (ph). Q: Okay. A: And mother was Carolina , maiden name Valat (ph). Q: Valat(ph), oka y. A: Valat(ph), yes. So part of her family was also Œ lived in the same place. M y uncle lived in the same place. But Œ Q: You mean, in Krulewiec (ph)? In Krulewiec ? A: Yes, yes. Q: Oh. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 13 A: But, I am talking about the early life, because in 1932, my father bought some land in the eastern part of Poland , because there were huge far Œ farms, owned by counts Œ hrabias , in Polish, and they were dividing the land for purchase, and a lot of people then purchased this Œ this land. So we moved from that original area, into the eastern part of Poland . Q: Okay. I™m going Œ A: And that™s where my Œ most of my youth Œ of course, that wasn™t long, because from ™32 to 1940, when we were deported to Russia, it™s what, only Œ Q: Eight years. A: Œ eight years. Q: Yeah. A: But that™s where I spent my you Œ youth. Q: Right. Where Œ so, how mu Œ A: Up to the age of 13. Q: Okay. We™ll come to that. Now, I just want to do a bit of comparison. Your father owned the land in Krulewiec (ph)? Did he own it? A: He owned the land, and buildings, and yes. Q: Okay. A: He was a builder by cro Œ by profession. But he also owned a little farm. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 14 Q: All right, how much Œ how many hectares was the farm? A: Four. Q: Four hectares. A: Four hectares, including an orchard. Q: Okay. A: Which was right by our house, in the back of the Œ the lots were very wide Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ you know, by Œ Q: Well, he Œ four hectares is Œ it™s maybe small for a farm, but it™s an awful big area for, you know, a lot of land. You know, for a piece of land. A: Yes, I think it was just average. Q: Yeah. A: F-Four, five hectares. Q: Could you feed a family from the four or five hectares? A: Oh yes, yes. So Œ Q: So how many hectares did he buy in eastern Poland? A: Seven. He Œ he bought seven hectares, because that Œ it was called folwark , which is like a large f-farm owned by count. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 15 A: And they were dividing the land after the war. It was government program Œ Q: Land reform. A: Œ to Œ to break up this large Œ Q: Estates. A: Œ ownerships. Q: Yeah. A: So people were Œ were able to buy Œ some people who had some contribution in obtaining the independence of Poland were given land. But my father did not get, he bought it. Q: He bought it. A: He bought it, yes. Q: But tell Œ tell me Œ A: Because he was a bricklayer, and a builder. Q: Okay, tell me this. Seven hectares, compared to four is not that much more. I mean, it is double. A: Yes. Q: But he moved his family across Poland Œ A: Right. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 16 Q: Œ for that. What was the motivation? Because it was seven hectares, rather than four? A: First of all, the Œ the Œ the land was much better in the eastern part, because it Œ you Œ you Œ part of the Ukraine, which was Œ it was called like the feeding area for the Europe , for Europe . Q: Was the breadbasket of Europe . A: Breadbasket for Europe , and I Œ I don™t know why he didn™t buy more, but actually, that was Œ that was it. But, as I say, his farming was a parttime actually. Q: Okay. A: Cause his main income was from Œ Q: Construction. A: Œ being a builder. Q: Yeah. So did he Œ did he build that Œ was there already a house on that land when you moved there, or did he build it? What did that place look like? A: Well, that was another example where the land was being divided because it was owned by hrabia , which is Count Flossik (ph). Q: Flossik (ph), mm-hm. A: Yes, he Œ he own a huge amount of land, and people were buying a lot Œ Q: Yes, yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 17 A: Œ like I remember seven new possessions started Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ on that land where Œ where he sold out. Q: Okay, so seven parcels of land. A: Seven parcels from this original Œ Q: Estate. A: Œ big land. Q: Yeah. A: So some bought more, and other, you know, but there were, again, fairly new, like subdivision. It was there Œ there was a village, a old, ancient village, and then this new area was built on the land that was subdivided. Q: Okay. And paint me a picture with words, of what this place looked like when you were growing up. Did it also have one straw Œ one street with brick houses on each side? A: No, it was more like scattered. There was Œ there were small streets. Q: Could you see your neighbors from your own house? A: Yes, we could see neighbors. As a matter of fact, we Œ we were close to four families. Q: Okay.

Q: So the whole family lived in the rectangular house in the four rooms? A: In the rectangular house, yes. Q: Okay. A: There were two big bedrooms, let™s say, you know, for th e Œ for the father and mother, and then for the children, there was this Œ this other room, and we lived, sisters and brothers. But by that time, you know, my oldest brothers were already gone. He Œ he was an editor of a newspaper in the city of Równa . So he didn™t live with us, he only came from Œ for visiting.

A: Œ I™m talking about my experience, I don™t know Œ Q: That™s Œ that™s what Œ all I want, is your experience, yes. A: Yes, yes.

Q: Let™s Œ A: Somebody with a talent and ability, or Œ or desire, could go high. But that time, the government was very conscientious and tried to help, the Œ you know, right after the Poland regained independence in 1918, the Œ the government used to be very conscientious, and that they did everybo Œ ever ything that they could to help farmers, professionals, to get on Œ get Œ get ahead. And those 20 years between 1918 and 1940, or ™39, when war started, it was a very intensive development. I Œ I can Œ can vouch for that, remember that. Government was very helpful. They were giving loans for Œ for the farmers for develop Œ to buy equipment. We already had Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 50 mechanized machinery to Œ to sow, instead of sowing like this, you know, from a pouch, then you had machines to Œ Q: To sow the Œ A: Œ to sow the grain, and Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ pick up potatoes, there were machines that you pick up the potatoes. It was Œ I Œ I enjoyed Œ Q: It was a change, yeah.

Q: Œ I want to talk about all of the events that led up to that. A: Yeah. Q: So, do you remember where you were when World War II broke out, when Germany invaded Poland . Do you remember that time, that day? A: Oh, 1939, yeah Œ yes. Q: September first. A: Yes. I think we were probably in scho ol. We were in Œ at school that time. Q: How did you learn that the war started? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 52 A: Well, through the radio Œ ra-radio, and it spread real fast, you know, through the village. Q: What were people talking about? A: They were afraid that Œ first of all, SSe ptember, let™s say, first, to September 17th, when the Russians came in, it was a very short time. So we were afraid that the Germans would come close to us, because Germany took over the Œ the western part of Poland. Q: Okay. A: Invaded the ve Œ western part, and Œ Q: Right. A: Œ occupied real fast. But they still didn™t come to us. Q: Did you ex Œ did you ever see a German soldier? A: No. Q: Never. Okay. A: No, not at that time. Q: Okay. A: I saw them later on. Q: Okay. A: But no. And then, on the 17 th of September, the Russians come into Poland . Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 53 Q: And did you see Œ A: In-Invaded the eastern part, the Œ completely half of Œ of Poland . Q: So Œ A: So I remember them ki Œ coming in on tanks. Q: Tell me about that. What did you see, and when did you see it? A: Well, first the village didn™t have very good roads, they were like dirt roads. Q: Okay. A: And they ca Œ came in tanks, so they would raise a lot of dust, and everything like that. And some people, because the population was mixed, some were ra Œ of Russian descent, let™s say, or Ukrainian, and some Poles. So those Russian people would welcome them, with flowers, and they would throw flowers at the soldiers. And they were happy, waving, things like that. We were not happy. We were Œ we knew that they are not our friends, they are our enemies. So that™s Œ Q: Was it expected that Œ I mean, did you expect to see Russian soldiers in Œ or was it just something people were waiting to happen? A: No, no, no, it was sudden, came in because there was no like, radio programs with news on a regular basis. So no, we only saw them when they came in to the Œ the village. Q: So it was a complete surprise? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 54 A: It was a complete surprise, and they came on tanks, on dirt roads, instead of maybe just armored cars on tires, you know. No, it was horrible, it was terrible. And we™re scared, we absolutely Œ well, we di Œ didn™t know what to do, but everybody was interested to see what Œ wha Œ what™s going on. And right away, the local people, those Ukrainians, formed like militia. Militia? Q: Okay. A: And they declared themselves friends of the Russians. Q: So pe Œ are these people you actually knew? A: Yes, and we knew, we went to s Œ Q: They were your neighbors. A: Œ school together, they™re our neighbors, and my friends that I played with. But ethnic background was different. So we were scared, and it was really bad, cause we didn™t Œ Ukrainians killed a lot of people then. Q: Really? A: When the Russians came in, they take like a revenge or something like that, you know. So Œ Q: What ki Œ what Œ what would they have been taking revenge for? A: For some personal maybe, misunderstandings, or quarrels, or something like that. I don™t know, I didn™t have anything against anybody. Q: Yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 55 A: My father was very well liked in the village. He was very well liked, because they Œ like, he was helpful. He Œ he was in such a profession that everybody Œ Q: They needed him. A: Œ needed, right. Who wa Œ whatever they needed, he was there to do it. And yet, they were very turn Œ turned Œ completely turned against us. It™s Œ I still can™t understand that, because I think that they Œ they lived in Œ peacefully until the very end when Œ when the Russians came in. So everybody was friendly and everything else, helpful. But when the Russians came in, they already put armbands, those local Œ local Ukrainians, and they started cooperating, collaborating with the Russians. But it wasn™t wrong, because the Russians then arrested those people Œ Q: Really? Okay. A: Œ who were so friendly towards them. They ar rested them, and they send them somewhere nobody knew them. Q: And what had happened with the Polish police? I mean, there was Polish police, and then this militia comes and they disarm Œ A: Well, they were disarmed, and you know, I don™t know whether they arrested or no, or just let go. Q: Okay. A: But Œ yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 56 Q: What about your father™s business? Did he Œ was he continuing to work, or did he stay at home when all of this was taking place? You know, did life go on? A: No, life went on, but it was a very short time, really, because September to February, and Œ and Œ and February we were taken a-away from Œ from there, from our place. Q: Did you go to school? A: I was going to school all the time, yes. Q: Did school change? Did the school Œ A: Oh well, yes, yes, because first of all, right, they forbid us to say prayers, because we used to, before lessons started, we used to say short prayers, in the school. But when this took place, when the Russians came in, they forbade praying in school. Q: Okay. A: So that was the first indication, you know, that Œ Q: It™s different. A: But Œ but we still tried to say prayers before, but privately they™d say, you know. The teachers wa-wasn™t in this class, and never took part before, teacher would guide us with the Œ Q: Right. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 57 A: Œ with the prayers, but after that, that stopped completely, right away. Q: Did your teachers change? Did the teacher change, or the same teachers? A: No, no, teachers didn™t Œ the teachers remained, and they were all fine, all the time they were fine. They were Œ had Œ had to be probably very careful what Œ what they taught, and Œ but of course, it changed. Q: What else changed, besides not being able to say prayers at the beginning, what Œ did the classes change? Did the curriculum change? A: No, cu -curriculum continued, continued the same way. Q: Okay, even Polish history? A: Until a Œ all the way to the time that they deported us. So, September to February. Q: February. A: Beginning of February. Nothing changed. The same teachers and Œ Q: And the same stu Œ subjects. A: Some Œ the same subjects, yes. Q: Did Œ were there soldiers that stay Œ did you see soldiers staying in the village, or did they pass through, and then left? A: No, they Œ they Œ some stayed, and they took over the administration, you know, all the Œ the offices were th Œ where the trustees, village trustees probably, you Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 58 would call them then, you know. So they took over these offices, and no Œ nonothing substantial to me. Nothing substantial took place. We carried on with th Œ with the schooling and we could say prayers and sing Polish songs, and everything. No Œ no problem. Q: Now, the Œ but the Œ the people who took over the Œ the authorities that took over the village, sort of administration Œ A: Yes [indecipherable] Q: Œ they were not local. They were from the Œ the occupiers? Or were they local? A: No, they were Œ some were local. Q: And they hadn't been arrested? A: At the beginning Œ at the beginning Œ Q: At the beginning. A: Œ when they put those armbands Œ Q: Armbands on. A: Œ and everything, they declared themselves friends, and that Œ they actually welcomed those local people. Q: Welcomed. A: I Œ I call local people. Those that lived there in the village, before we came in. Q: Right. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 59 A: Before my father bought some land there. Q: Yeah. A: So they were local people. Q: Right. A: So they were very friendly towards Russian, because they were mostly of Œ of Ukrainian Œ they speak Œ spoke Ukrainian at home, and Œ and of course, at school we Œ we had a regular classes in Russian, or Ukrainian. Q: So Œ but you said they were then arrested. So who replaced them? Wer Œ you said that some of the Russians arrested Œ the Soviet army arrested some of these people. A: Yes, they did. Q: And then were they replaced in the municipal Œ A: Replaced with some of those Ukrainians who Œ who were able, or maybe a little more educated, that could carry on. Q: And were these people di Œ A: And they took over, and the Russians soldiers. Q: Okay. A: Russian soldiers with Œ in uniforms, they were runni ng thi Œ stuff.

Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 62 A: Well, there were some arrests right away, but later on things quieted down, so there was nobody revolting, let™s say, against the authority or anything like that. There was no reason to. Q: Mm-hm. Were there any Polish military units, or officers, or soldiers who had been in the area when the Russians came in? A: No. There were no Œ Q: So there was no Polish mil itary presence? A: No military presence, no. Q: Okay.

Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 63 Q: Tell me what happened. A: Well, early in the morning, on the 10 th of February, I think Saturday, they came in. It was still dark outside, maybe five o™clock, something like Œ we all asleep. So they started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think Œ I don™t know who was the first, Father, Mother, got up, went to the door, opened the door, they came in. There were about five Russian soldiers with guns Œ no rifles, with rifles and bayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? Imet™ oruzhiye . That™s in Russian. Q: Imet™ oruzhiye ? A: Oruzhiye . Do you have weapons? My father says no, I don™t have any weapon. Although, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know. He didn™t even say nothing, because he couldn™t get to it, or even if he could, he couldn™t do anything, because there™s lo Œ many of them, these Russian soldiers, well-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are Œ you are going to be taken away from here. And says, you Œ you do not belong Œ you do not belong to here. He says, Father, what? This is my land. No, it™s not yours. We are taking over. It™s no more Œ no longer it™s yours, you Œ you have nothing, just pack up whatever you can, food and some clothing. Because they came with those vehicles, carriages. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 64 Q: Horse-drawn? A: Horse-drawn carriages, yeah. And they said, here, pack up what you want, or what you can, take some warm clothing and some food. So Œ and they were well, like I say, armed. You had to obey th eir orders. I mean, Mother was resisting . Whatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw off. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha Œ with them. She Œ she Œ she didn™t Œ she couldn™t comprehend this, you know, what™s going on. Why Œ why are you taking us away? What was Œ where are we going? We don™t know, but you have to move. We ™ll Œ we™ll take you away from here. So she was throwing things off. And the soldiers would put some food, let™s say, food or clothing, or Œ back on the vehicle, she would throw it back. They threaten her, if you will continue like this, we™ll shoot you. This is what Œ what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law started talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do, because otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That™s what he said. Now, so she calmed down, and we put some stuff on the Œ on these carriages, and then they drove us away from our home. Q: How much Œ how much time had they given you to do this? A: Oh, it Œ maybe hour and a half, it was something like that. No Œ no more than two hours. We Œ we Œ we were on the way. But they took us Œ this I remember, I™ll Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 65 tell you why, took us to the local school, because there was room, you know, in the school, classes and everything, there was assembly hall. So they put all these people together in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out from the school, went back to our house, which wasn™t far, maybe half a mile. So when I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and bacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our dining room. So, I took the violin. I could have run away somewhere, you know, to Œ Q: Right. A: Œ some neighbors or something like that, but I didn™t. I took the violin, and I went back to my parents, which were held in that school. But I saw this [indecipherable] when they already having good time on the food and everything. So imagine, I Œ I see Œ really terrible thing to even imagine how these people felt, that they had to leave everything behind, for what, why? Why do Œ why are you taking, what™s Œ no compensation, no reason, no nothing. Just Œ Q: You were never told Œ you were never told why you Œ A: No, you never told. You Œ he says, this doesn™t belong to you any more. State is taking over. State means Russia, Soviet Russia . The state is taking over your Œ your possessions and everything, and they forced us out, by taking us to this school. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 66 They kept us there for several hours. Course, it was early in the morning, but I think by noon, they moved us to , which is the town, because they had better facilities there, larger. And they put us in a courtroom, large, big hall, where normal trials were taking place. Now Œ Q: I want to ask something. The Œ in the school where they put you Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ do you recognize Œ were there other people there from the village, who were also taken? A: Yes, yes, there was my uncle Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ was taken. But strange thing, his family was the parents, they had two girls and two sons. So, these authorities, whoever they were, took the father, my uncle, with two sons, arrested them just like us, but left the mother and the girls in the house. They left them there. For no Œ what was ever reason? They wanted Œ the father and mother wanted to Œ Q: Be together. A: Œ get together, as a s Œ you know. But they didn™t allow it. No, you stay. Who decided that? I don™t know, but this is happening, I see it right now, how it happened. So they were deported, this father, my uncle, and my two cousins, Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 67 deported to the Russia Œ to Russia , the same as us. But the f Œ mother and girls are Œ were left behind. And they Œ they lived there all through the war. Q: It makes no sense. A: It makes no sense, but this is what happened.

A: No, no, nobody from the village. Q: I see. So it was not even the whole Œ A: Only Œ only these people that Œ that came Œ originally came from the center of Poland , you know, that purchased this land. Q: Yeah, yeah. So how Œ so the pe Œ the soldiers who came into your home, you didn™t recognize them. You didn™t know who they were. A: No, they were Russian. Russian soldiers. Q: But somehow Œ A: Never saw them, you know, in my life. Q: So s Œ but somebody must have told them that this family, and this family, and Œ A: Yes, yes, and they Œ of course, they were these Ukrainian people who took over administration, this village administration, they said, oh, these are the people. But we Œ everybody knew, because we were like a newcomer from the central foreign. So we Œ we live in that area. That™s a part of Westchester here. Q: Okay. A: But the village was Œ was over there, and we were only this compound, seven families. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 69 Q: And Œ and nobody else from that larger village was deported? A: No, nobody. Only these people that came several years Œ Q: Before.

A: So they are together, and from then on they moved us to the railroad station in Brody, 24 miles Œ no, 24 kilometers away. Q: Okay. A: On the horse driven carriages. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 70 Q: Wagons, yeah. A: Yeah. So it™s took a day. In the morning, before noon, to Podkamie . They kept us there for a while, and then in the afternoon, they drove us to Brody , which had the railroad station, and there were already freight trains, boxcars, wooden boxcars in the rail Œ on the railroads. And they put us in Œ in these railroad cars, shut the door, and drove us away. Q: What did it look like inside those boxcars? A: Well, there was wooden platforms, I think two levels. So they put, let™s say, two families in each. Oh, I don™t know, for instance Œ Q: Oh, I don™t think you should get up, sorry. A: No, that™s okay [indecipherable] something like that. Q2: Should I pause, or Œ Q: No, no, no, no, no. Okay. A: Imagine this is a freight car. Q: Okay. A: With the doors over here, just like you see in Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ the same kind Œ Q: Hang on a second. When he™s showing on the book, do the book. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 71 Q2: Yeah, I™m ready to. Q: Okay, all right. So Œ so focus on the book when he™s showing the book. Okay, so yeah, the Œ so you™re showing me something. So here™s the freight cars. A: Yes, boxcar just like you see now. Q: Right. A: Taking goods all over. Brown Œ mostly brown, with Œ with a door here, and a door here, right? Q: Right. A: Sliding door. And this part, there is like a center, you know, and this part they had platform, they built platform, two levels. Q: Okay. A: And they put two families on top, and two families on the Œ depends on the family, maybe three families, if they™re small family. But there was like seven, eight people on this wooden platform, inside this freight train. Q: So there wo uld be Œ so there would be these Œ these levels would be wooden levels. A: Wooden. Q: And Œ and you would be lying down, or s Œ or sitting up in these Œ A: You couldn™t Œ you couldn™t Œ you had to go on knees, you know. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 72 Q: Okay. A: Because regular there is, if you put two platforms, divide that height. Q: That™s right. Yeah. A: Which is what, maybe eight feet? Q: Okay. A: So, you had to Œ Q: Slide in. A: Œ on the Œ on your knees. Q: And then anybody Œ A: And they just lay down. There Œ there was straw on the wooden planks. Q: Okay. A: And on this straw, you just laid down and Œ Q: Was everybody crammed in, so there were people Œ A: Very, very close together. Q: And did anybody stay in that middle area, standing up? A: No, in the middle area there was a metal Œ what do you Œ heating Œ heating like Œ stove, a stove. Q: A stove, okay. A: Metal stove with Œ with pipes Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 73 Q: Okay. A: Œ going out, and a hole in, let™s say over here, a hole for a restroom. Q: I see. A: And people put up a sheet just to, you know, so me Œ some privacy. But they didn™t care. I mean, they were just providing a hole, and you had to use it whenever you needed. And there was this stove, where you could boil your water. Q: If you got water. A: Well, yeah, you Œ you Œ you Œ there was a pai Œ pail. Q: A pail of water. A: A pail of water, and every Œ I mean, this is at the beginning, right, so you could boil this water, and nothing else. But they told us to take some food, so people will take whatever they had, maybe bacon, or bread, basically. Cheese. Things like that. Eggs. So, whoever was more industrious, they take more on Œ and it was a good decision. Others didn™t take much, and they were starving. Q: And Œ and Œ and so it mean that those soldiers, who were yelling at your mother Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ were doing you a favor, because she Œ I mean, it™s ironic that they were saying, take the food, take the food. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 74 A: Yes. Ta Œ as much Œ yes, take as much as you can, basically food and warm clothing. Q: Yeah. A: That™s Œ that™s all they told us, yeah. Warm clothing and food. Q: And since this was February, were there snowdrifts outside? Was there a lot of snow at that point? Was it cold? A: There was a lot of snow, this was a very heavy winter, a lot of snow.

And they would provide this coal every time they stopped on the Œ on Œ on this trip, so they give you more coal. Q: Did it keep it per Œ did it keep it warm, or not really? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 75 A: No, because it was as cold as it is now, or colder. No, no, no. There was frost inside of the Œ of this freight train, inside. Q: And about how many people were in that one boxcar? A: In our car, th-there were, I think about 40 Œ 40 persons. So there were like four different platforms where you could Œ so in about 10 Œ 10 to a platform yes, it™s exactly Œ because my platform had nine people. We were close together, and Œ Q: Was it your whole family? A: Yes. Well, whole family, that means my parents, and one sister, and me. Q: I see, four of you, and five other people. A: Four of us.

Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 76 A: Well, when Œ when they put us into this trains, the car Œ transport Œ was quite the long transport, and it started to move east Œ east from Poland . It was in the city of Brody, yeah, I said that Œ that™s what the station was. And we started the journey. So, next day, the Œ the journey actually start the next day, because the first day, was 10th of February, was just moving from the house to the station. And next day, the train started moving towards Russia . Q: Did anybody tell you where you were going? A: No, nobody told us, but direction, you know, we knew that we are going east. Q: How did you know that? A: East, west, south. Q: I mean, you were able to tell Œ were you able to see through Œ was there any place to see through? A: Well, yes, y es, there was. Q: Okay. A: There Œ there di Œ sure, there were little openings, like small windows, about the size of Œ of that thi Œ block. Q: Th Œ oh, the one Œ I see. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Small windows there, and somebody would be looking through? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 77 A: Well , somebody, yes. I was looking through, the only time. Q: Tell me what you saw, as you Œ A: Well, I saw little villages, and under the snow, these were all covered with snow, so whatever. Trees, rivers, roads. I could see it. Q: That first day Œ yeah, the first day when you™re moving out, were you able to look through that little kind of window, outside of Œ A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: So, could you tell when you left Poland , and entered the s Œ the Soviet Union ? Was it Œ was Œ you able to tell that, or not? A: Ah, yes, first of all, the Polish railroad trucks are narrower than the Russians. So when you came to the border between Poland Œ Poland and Russia , they had to change the wheels, or Œ or Œ Q: Aha, they had to narrow down Œ to go to Œ or they widen up? A: No, wider, so Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ it took some time before Œ and they had technique Œ they Œ they had ways of doing it, and it was all pretty efficient. So they just change the whole wheel assembly. The same box, they lifted up, changed the wheels, and off we went to Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 78 Russia. So we knew that we are going to Russia , and where Œ wherever they stopped it for Œ for changing this wheels, that Œ that was the border. Q: That™s right. That would make sense. A: That was the border. And as far as I know, I have some notes that I took, four days it took us, between our house and the time we reached the Œ the borders Œ Q: Oh, really? A: Œ in Russia . It was four days. Q: Four days? A: Four days. Q: I would have thought it wouldn™t take so long because Œ A: It shouldn™t. It wasn™t that far, but it took time. Q: To get there. A: First of all, when Œ when they took us to Brody , a lot of other people would be co -coming. So they were gathering this transport, they were arranging a hu Œ long transport, maybe of 40 carriages, or something like that, you know? A long transport. But there were only few from our place, and few from others, and I know these people because I met them later, in Canada . Q: On the same transport? A: No, no, that they were taken the same time. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 79 Q: Yeah. A: And Œ yeah, the same Œ in the same transport, right. So, it took some time to ffull Œ to organize the complete Œ Q: So fill up all the cars. A: Fill out. Q: Okay. A: Fill up all those, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Because fr-from us, there was not enough even for one Œ one wagon. Q: Yeah. A: But from other places, and like I say, Pieniaki , Marinicka (ph), Kutishcha (ph). I remember those names from Œ they are still there. Q: Okay. I want to stop right now, for a second.

And before the break, Mr. Chudzik , we were talking about the day, and the time of year when your family was thrown out of their homes and put on the train. A: On the train, yes. Q: And Œ and we stopped pretty much at the area where you had been describing to me the border where the train cars are lifted, and the wheels are exchanged for the wider rails of the Soviet railway system. A: Right. Q: Tell me, after that Œ after you passed into the territory of the Soviet Union proper, about how long did the journey take? A: It took two Œ two weeks, or just under two weeks, I think maybe 11 or 12, 13 Œ 12 days. Q: Twelve days. A: Twelve days, because that™s 10, and 22 nd, we were at the destination, which was in Archangel district, and the place was called Shenchuga . Q: Shenchuga . A: Shenchuga . Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 81 Q: Chuga (ph). A: And it was a small settlement, where there were already some families lived there who w ere moved by Stalin from Ukraine to that area, in about 33 rd Œ 1933, 1934. It was that area when all the time where Stalin moved a lot of Ukrainian people and Byelorussian people into that Œ we call it Siberia . Q: Okay. A: Archangel . Q: So that could have been Œ that could have been during the Œ what eventually became the famine. The Œ the famine in Ukraine in those years. A: Exactly, exactly. That™s Œ that™s the time. Q: Okay. And Œ A: A lot of people were moved from Ukraine to those areas, and their Œ Q: Would you say they were deported as well, by being moved? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: We must have been deported just Œ just to c Œ they were taken out of their Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ homes and Œ and sent there, sent to that area. Q: So tell me, geographically, this archet Œ arc Œ how is Œ how do we pronounce it? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 82 A: Archangel . Q: Archangel . Arkhangelsk . Where is that in the Soviet Union ? Is it in the Œ just where is it, where do we find it? A: All right, it™s almost north of Moscow. Q: Okay. A: It™s Œ Archangel is the port on the ber Œ Bering Sea, I think. Q: Okay. A: Up north. And it goes through another city of Vologda. Q: Vologda . A: Vologda is the Œ one of the larger cities, and it™s like a Œ a railroad center from there, there are different directions that Œ that Œ that they had, that the tra Œ tracks built. Q: So tell me, in this 12 days that it took to get there, what were the conditions like in the cattle car? A: We were able to get out of the wagon, or whatever, wha Œ how could you call it? Q: Cattle car. Cattle car. A: Car Œ cattle car? Yeah, goods train, cattle car. When the train stopped to take water, as a locomotive was filling up with water, and maybe fuel, then people were able to get out of this transport, and just maybe walk, or go to a Œ because usually it Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 83 was like a Œ by the station, railway station. So they could go there, and maybe purchase something, like bread. On some stations, there was bread available. Or, get boiled water, which they called kipiatok . Q: Kipiatok ? A: In Russia , kipiatok . Which is just boiled water, but you could use it to make something like tea, or what Œ or whatever you had to put in it Œ into it. And sometimes it was two hours stop, maybe three hours stop, and then everybody would get back. Of course, it was guarded. There were, every few wagons, or yes , yes, I call it wagon, there were guards, Russian military guards. So they were taking Œ w-watching everybody. You couldn™t get too far away from Œ from where the station was, where the train was stopped. But normally, what the train was put on a side truck, and there was nowhere to go, really. Q: So there wouldn™t be towns that were connected to these railway stations? A: No, there was towns, yes. Q: There were towns? A: There were towns, but nobody was allowed to Œ to leave, towards the town. Q: Were there people in your car, in Œ in your wagon, who spoke Russian? A: Oh, I suppose, yeah, I spoke Russian. Q: Even so? Even as a young b Œ oh, because of your studying in school. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 84 A: Stu Œ in school we were learning Russian in school, yes. Q: And were you able to, when you stopped in these places, to get a sense of where you were, geographically? A: Oh, not really, because wa Œ if you ask Œ and I did ask, also, so they said, because it was war. So they say, military secret. You Œ you Œ you Œ we are not allowed to discuss anything, you know. They couldn™t tell you. But there were names on the stations, so we could read the name of it. Moskva is easy. M-o-s Œ Q: Did you stop through Moscow? A: We went through Moscow , yes. Our transport went through Moscow , towards north. Q: Okay. A: To Vologda , and then little past Vologda , there is a Kenosha , similar name to this Kenosha in Œ in Wisconsin . Q: Really? A: Well, ko, or K Œ K Œ Kenosha , or Œ Kenosha . And there is a truck going towards northeast, towards Kotlas . Q: Kotlas. A: Kotlas is larger city again, on the Dvina river. Dvina, Dvina . Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 85 A: So they Œ they took us on that. Q: So people were able to at least get out and get some he Œ some hot water. A: Get out Œ get out, get water, or even purchase something, or exchange [indecipherable] purchase, because the Œ nobody had that money, at that time, in rubles. Q: Yeah. A: So, but exchange, you could exchange anything, shoes. Q: Do you remember if your family traded anything? A: Yes, we traded some, like we traded shawl, a shawl, or, we Œ we had some extra shirts, so we could trade it, or ba Œ blankets were very, very Œ I mean, you know, desirable, but I Œ people kept some blankets for themselves. Q: Yeah. A: Because it was cold, and there was only one metal stove in this va Œ wagon. Q: Did anybody get sick on the way there? A: Yes, people got sick. And out of about 60 people, nine died on this Œ on the journey. Q: In your wagon? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 86 A: Yes. And my Œ my brother™s two sons, little guys, you know one was nine years old, and the other was seven years old, they died. We think that it was from pneumonia, but nobody could tell for sure, because there were no Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ doctors to tell you what the disease was, or what Œ what was Œ the element was. But Œ Q: So from Œ in 12 days. A: Yes, in 12 days, exactly 12 days. And we Œ if we stopped at a station, people were allowed to get out of the wagon, and either walk, or people took a opportunity to do the natural Œ Q: Functions? A: Œ functions, or get this Œ this boiled water, which is Œ it was very, very important for everybody. Kipiatok was very important. Alco Œ we could get some boiled on the stove, but there was no way of getting water Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ anywhere, because there was only one pail provided. And so what, the water didn™t last. But people gather snow, and melted the snow on the stove, and took Œ drank that water made fr -from stove Œ from snow. Q: So your brothers two children, your nephews, who died Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 87 A: Yeah. Yes. Q: Did they Œ did they die at the end, or in the middle of the journey? A: It was, I me Œ the middle. In the middle of the journey. And they Œ they didn™t have any burial. Pe-People who died during the journey were left on the railroad platform, where there always Œ there were always co rpses already, as we were, let™s say, passing through the stations, or we stopped at the stations, so there were people, dead people, corpses on the platforms, ready to be moved somewhere, but we don™t know where. I mean, you know, whether they [indecipherable] cemetery, or whatever. Q: And were the two little boys left there as well? A: Yes, left there, against, you know, wishes, you know. They wanted to bury them, but there was no chance of anything like that. No chance. Q: I can™t imagine how your broth er, and how their mother must have felt. A: Oh, terrible, terrible. They were crying, and Œ and their despair, and it was awful. Absolute terrible. But that Œ that was Œ nobody cared. The guards didn™t care, and people who were Œ the engineers , they were Œ here they call them engineers, who were in charge of locomotive, they couldn™t do anything. They were just given orders to go Œ you know, whatever. Q: Drive the train, yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 88 A: Pardon? Q: They were given orders to drive the train. A: Yeah, drive the train, or th-the trains were put on a side track and they were Œ we were waiting for a couple days maybe. Because the 12 days, I mean, it™s not that far, you could do it in one day, really, if it Œ if was going all continuous, but they were stopping, and yes Œ yeah. Q: Were there old people who died as well, in your car? A: Oh, sure, sure, there was old people. I Œ even from my distant family, because my brother™s Œ my brother™s wife Œ wife™s sister, married sister, were also with us; so her husband passed. He was maybe 50 years old, or something like that. So people were dying. Q: What did you see when you got to the final destination? A: Well, we got to ma Œ Poduga (ph), which is Œ was a little town, where the station was. From there on, we were taken by sleigh Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ driven by horses, on Œ on snow. During the winter, they use sleighs. Q: Okay. A: Am I pronouncing it right, or no? Q: Yes, you are, you are. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 89 A: Yeah. So, they put us on sleighs, and some people were forced to walk behind. Those who could. Children and older people could sit in the sleighs. And they draw us from this railroad station to that final destination, which was a settlement inside the forest. Th-Th Œ there was an opening, a large opening, and there were mo Œ log houses. They were built like twins. It was one big, log house, with a wall in between Œ Q: I see. A: Œ separating these two. And there was a door here, and a door here. And you could just enter through this door, into the large room, and the whole families were there. I mean, you know, a large family, maybe seven, eight people, because there were families like that. So there was only one family, but otherwise there were two families, either a three or a four. So there were two or three families put into each of these big rooms. And there was a iron stove here, and na Œ and a bed, bed made of wood. And there was straw for mattresses, in a Œ in a box. Q: And did you Œ and this Œ A: A wooden box. Q: Would this be one bed in each corner, for each family? A: No, by one Œ let™s say it was a room smaller maybe, than this. So there was just a bed made of wooden pla Œ pla Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 90 Q: Planks. A: Œ planks. Planks. Yeah. And the whole family was in a Œ in one bed. Q: But if you have to Œ A: Parents and me and we™re all in one bed. Q: And then, did other families have another bed, in the same room? A: No, there was only one bed. Q: In the whole room? A: In the whole room. So if you were a family that was given one room, then you were okay. So the family wer Œ otherwise, there were two families in a bed. So there™s Œ Q: In one bed? A: Yeah. Q: How could they all fit? A: Well, what do you mean, you know, they just as Œ went to bed and slept it like, on a platform, on a wooden platform. There were no beds, or mattresses. Q: No, no, no, I guess I™m trying to get a sense of, if you had one room. A: Yeah. Q: And you had two families in it. A: Yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 91 Q: And there was only one bed Œ A: Right. Q: Œ how could they Œ how could two families fit on the one bed? A: Well, there were about si-six people could fit in a bed like that. It was not a regular bed, it was just to Œ Q: A raised platform? A: Raised platform, yes, with Œ with some sides, and lot of straw, and you just lay there. Q: Okay, and it was in the middle of the room, or to the side of it? A: No, maybe toward the corner, yes Œ Q: I see. A: Œ maybe to-toward the corner. But there was not much room for anything other than just sleeping, that™s Œ that™s all. Q: And were these rooms already occupied by other families when you came in, or were they empty? A: No, when we came in they were all empty. These Œ these log cabins were empty. Q: Okay. A: So they just are assigned several people, or one family, or two families to one room, and it™s Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 92 Q: And that™s Œ A: Œ it Œ it just started up like that. Q: And Œ A: So it was almost similar to being in the wagon, you know, in the carriage, on the way. Q: Yeah. A: Except that it was larger, and bay Œ made of logs. Q: And it didn™t move. And it didn™t move. A: No, no, it didn™t move. Q: Like Œ like the [indecipherable] A: You can Œ you can see these log houses in movies or in Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ Canada or something like that, you know. They™re putting log Œ little log cabins, they call them. Q: Yeah. A: Log cabin, that™s exactly what it was. Q: And was it Œ you say there was a stove in there. A: Yeah. Q: Was it use Œ did it Œ did it heat up the place, or was it frosted like the Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 93 A: Well, na, na Œ Q: No. A: Œ it Œ it gave a little warmth, but it was used for cooking, too, you know, if you had something that you could cook Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ then you could cook on that stove. But after we ga Œ that was during the journey, right, you are talking about Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ in the ra Œ but similar situation was at the destination, where they took us to Shenchuga , that Œ that settlement. So, it ™s Œ the homes were just like I describe, and you could Œ you would get cooked meal at the dining room. There was a large dining room, a co -community dining room. Q: Okay. A: Where they provide you with food, you didn™t have to pay for it. Q: So was this the first time that the authorities actually fed you, and up til then you had to eat whatever you had taken with you? A: Yeah, well, they were given Œ they were giving bread. A t every station they were giving bread. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 94 A: Maybe a one loaf, or two loafs, depends on the na Œ the number of Œ of people in a family, so Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ everybody would get out, and received an assign Œ assigned Œ Q: Portion. A: Œ portion. Q: Okay. And about how many of such log cabins were there in this settlement? A: The di Œ this is only from my memory, because I know how they were distributed. So maybe there Œ there were about 30. Q: So it was large? Was Œ you know, for a settlement in the middle of the forest. A: In the middle of the forest, but there were like a road, and a little cabin on both sides, and then another row, and another row. So there was Œ yeah, that™s probably a Œ a Œ a Œ maybe between 30 and 40. Q: And the forests, were these taw Œ A: They were people already living in s Œ in half of it. Q: I see. A: Because those people were deported to those areas in Œ during that famine. Q: Got it. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 95 A: Yes. But half, or almost half of that poselok we call it, it™s a settlement, was empty. Q: Did anybody come at that point, and when you got to that settlement Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ did they tell you why you were there, and what you were going to be doing? Was there any official announcement? A: Yeah, yes, they were tell, you are here to work in the forest, until you podokn eish (ph). In other words, until you die. But it Œ it wasn™t Œ this word die is not regular death, but if you Œ by the time you just end your life. Podokneish (ph), it™s more towards the animal, you know, pe Œ Q: Okay. A: Animals, they die also, right? Q: Right. A: We use this Œ at least I think we use the same word for animals and Œ and humans. Q: Okay. A: But over there it was different for animals. The animals, they™re just ending their life. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 96 A: So you are here until you end your life. That™s all. That Œ th-that was Œ they will always tell you that you are here to work, until you die. You could hear it from every guard, cause there were armed guards over there. It was like a Œ a military compound. Q: And so was it surrounded by a fence? A: No, there was no fence. The Œ the fence was natural habitat, you know, I™m Œ where could you go? Q: Yeah. A: Forest, and nothing. There was a river, a large river. Nobody could pass probably, unless he knew how to swim. But what Œ where Œ where could you go? On the other side of the river? Q: So Œ A: I Œ I did swim that river, and I Œ although, I was Œ yeah, I was only 13 years old, to begin with, and then 14. Q: Yeah. So Œ so, did they tell you what the work was? What was the work that everybody had to do? A: The work, mostly men and able women were assigned to cut timber. They were cutting timber, woom , you know, and then cutting these shorter pieces, about a yard long, three feet long. And somebody would put a cubical or something, you know, Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 97 like three by three. And then they would tie it with a rope, and there Œ the guy responsible, supervisor Œ a ma Œ a Russian guy, would come and stamp these pieces. He had like a hammer, and he put a stamp on everyone. It was funny. Well, now it™s [indecipherable] but some people were Œ would cut the ends very tiny, you know, cut it off during the night, or something like that. And they said, well, this is what we did today. So he would stamp it again, but it was the same cubicle. Q: So, in other words, they cut out the Œ A: They were cheating, people were cheating the authorities, let™ s say . Q: So that meant they Œ they™d cut the end that he had stamped. A: Yeah. Q: And they cut the stamp off, and they left it as if it hadn't been, and then dwi Œ they used the same cubic feet of Œ of logs for the next day. A: Yeah. For the next day. But it wasn™t that Œ I mean that Œ it™s not that typical, really. Q: Yeah, not that often. A: Not that often, but it happened. I know that happened, because my brothers used to do it, yeah. Q: What kind of instruments did they use for cutting logs, for cutting the trees? A: Oh, hand saws. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 98 Q: Hand saws. A: Hand saws. A big saw about five feet long, with big teeth, and a handle at each end, and they would Œ Q: So all of this was, let™s say, from human energy, no machines at all. A: There were machines at a saw mill. Q: I see. A: Because what happened, they cut the wood, timber, and they put them in the river. And they would float those logs on the river Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ to a place where they had saw mills. Q: Okay. A: And there were machinery with hooks, metal hooks, that would constantly rotate like this, you know, big chains, maybe 12, 14 feet long. And they Œ this chain would go into the river. And there were men who were guiding the logs towards this machine. Q: I see. A: And the hooks came, brought the logs on the shore, and there were people who took the logs again, in human strength, human force, and cut them into shorter Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 99 pieces, and put them into these cubicles, and from then on, they would move them on trains, to paper Œ Q: Paper mills. A: Factories, or paper plants, or Œ Q: So what Œ what was the wood that was being cut, was it pine? A: Pine. Ba-Basically pine, yes. Yes, one like what™s growing out here in this Œ Q: And did you Œ you were so young, were you put to work as well? A: Until I was 14 years old, I was forced to go Œ I mean forced, I liked to go to school. But it was a very short time, you see, when Œ when we arrive there, in February, I went to school. Q: Okay. A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years old, which, only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work. And this is what I did, cause I didn™t want to go to school there, so I started working when I was 14 years old. Q: And Œ A: I was Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ allow Œ I was Œ how you Œ au th-authorized. I was authorized Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 100 Q: Authorized. A: Œ to take up employment. But up to 14, no, you had to go to school and Œ Q: And so these Œ you said there was a school for the Russian kids? So Œ A: Yes, yes, in the regular school. Q: Okay, so in Œ in addition to the Ukrainians who had been deported, was there like a regular Œ were there regular Russians who weren™t prisoners of any kind, who Œ A: That™s right, that™s right. Q: Œ who lived there. A: All settlements. People lived there for many, many years. Q: Okay, generations, or something. A: Yeah, maybe generations, but who knows? Q: Did Œ did some of them live in different kinds of quarters than the one you describe? A: No, the same Œ the same kind of quarters, except that people wou Œ to expand, you know, they built a little shed by the Œ that log cabin, or they built like an entrance, so that normally you would enter from Œ from outside, like Œ Q: Right. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 101 A: Œ even here, you know, I don™t have anything else. But you could build a little Œ little Œ Q: Pre-entrance. A: [indecipherable] Q: Yeah, so Œ A: Œ entrance. So they were improving whatever they could do, or they just live the way it provided. Q: What about the camp administrators? Since they were the officials Œ A: Oh, they had beautiful Œ beautiful buildings. Q: Oh, did they? A: Yeah, they had beautiful buildings, large. I remember, because my father, who was a builder, he worked Œ they put him to work right away. And they di Œ they ha Œ the building that was there, was falling apart. So he almost rebuild it, and it was [indecipherable] like a mansion. Painted white, and everything you Œ sometimes you can see those, in the movies, big Œ big homes. So that™s where the commandant, or the Œ the Œ the main administrator lived. Q: And did they have families? A: They had families, yes, but they were armed, and they were just like a military personnel. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 102 Q: Okay, so you were the prisoners, and they were the guards. A: We were prisoners, but we are not prisoners in th Œ in the sense that we couldn™t go out, or anything like that. But within that area, yeah, we could move freely. Q: Okay. A: Freely. But there was nowhere to go. Nowhere to go, unless somebody wanted to risk, you know Œ Q: Well, going out in the winter, into the forest to cut trees, did people Œ were they given the kind of clothing that you would need, or not? A: No, no, no, whatever we brought with us Œ Q: That was it. A: Œ that™s what Œ that™s what they used. They wouldn™t Œ maybe later on, because then they Œ they Œ they started paying for Œ for you r time that you worked in the forest. People were paid, so you could probably buy little better Œ Q: Was there a store there? A: There was one official store. There no privacy Œ there were no private enterprise, nothing. Q: Right. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 103 A: But there was a store, and usually you could buy shoes, special Œ specially adapted for Œ for that cold. They were might Œ made out of fabric. Fabric with some cotton inside, or whatever was it, wool? Cotton wool? Q: Yeah. A: Yeah, cotton wool. I have pictures of those things here, you could see how they looked. Q: And what else would be in these Œ in these stores? A: Oh, they had lot of champagne. Q: Really? A: Yeah, there™s Œ you enter into the store, so the Œ all the shelves were full of champagne bottles. And you could buy it, if you had money. But I don™t think Œ and they were selling bread, but bread was rationed. You were allowed, for instance, half a pound of bread, and you had coupons like. You had Œ Q: So they Œ A: Œ tender Œ tendered the coupon, and then get the bread for it, and pay for it. But, just give you an example. When I reached the age of 14 years old, I started working. And I was supplying a fuel to those steam boilers. You had to constantly feed steam boilers to produce steam, to operate the machines. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 104 A: And I worked as one that was supplying the fuel to these large boilers. Q: And these Œ these were the machines that were Œ A: Taking the wood out, or Œ Q: Of the water. A: Œ no Œ and then they were also cutting, but at the saw mills, they have mechanical saws, big saws like this. So they were operated by steam. Every Œ every machine that was there, was operated by sa Œ by steam. No electricity, by steam. Q: Interesting. A: So there were big boilers, constant, and supply tubes. They had systems, you know, built pretty well. Organized, you know. Q: Was it Œ was it Œ were you warm, as you were doing this? Was this a kind of a job that people would have wanted to have, because of the conditions, or is it a difficult job? A: No. No, no, no, you Œ you Œ you h ad no choice, you were Œ you were assigned. Q: I know. A: You Œ you are going to do this, and you this and this. You Œ you couldn™t Œ Q: I understand you couldn™t choose. A: You couldn™t choose. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 105 Q: My point Œ yeah, my question is that, was it a good job to have, in the conditions, or was it one that was too difficult and nobody wanted to do it? A: There was no other work available, only timber. Everything was timber. Cutting wood, cutting to smaller pieces, cleaning it, removing the branches. That™s was Œ Q: Was your work outside? A: Outside all the time. Q: Ah, okay. A: Outside. Q: It was outside. A: They were cutting the trees, big, tall trees, cleaning them, then cutting shorter, putting them on like pallets, and Œ Q: And supplying the fuel to the steam boiler was also something that was done outside? A: Oh yeah, yeah Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ outside, yes, outside there. We were Œ there were four of us that were responsible for supplying the fuel to the boilers, and we had a little carriage on four wheels, that were on tracks Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 106 A: Œ regular tracks. Well, we had to push this to where the other people were cutting the Œ the wood to shorter pieces. We collect those ends, put them on the thing, and take it to the boiler area. Q: So was Œ so, it was the ends of the wood that was the fuel? A: Yeah, for these boilers. Q: For these boilers. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: So th Œ it was the scrap wood that you were Œ A: Scrap wood. Q: Wood. A: Or whatever was there, because they were cutting certain lands, equal land s, but there were leftovers. So this leftover, we picked up, and haul it Œ haul it to Œ to the boiler area. Q: Okay. And so, in your own barracks, did you also have some of the scrap wood to heat your own barracks, or Œ A: Yes, yes. Q: Yes. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 107 A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes, yes. Q: Was it allowed, or was it Œ A: Was it a Œ sure, it was allowed, a plentiful. Q: Okay. A: It Œ yeah, you could Œ Q: Okay. A: Whatever you needed for the little stove Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ you could have it, right, could have it. Q: Was there anything that, let™s say, of these materials, of what you found in the forest, that you couldn™t take? That wasn™t allowed to be used for your own purposes? A: No, no, there was nothing, no. Q: Okay. A: Everything Œ well, I mean, I Œ I Œ I can™t imagine what Œ what really Œ what Œ Q: Well, sometime I™ve Œ I™ve heard of people who got in trouble because they were accused of taking hay that wasn™t supposed to be taken, or Œ and sometimes Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 108 A: Well, yeah, maybe if there were those state farms Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ of course, that™s Œ that™s right, you couldn™t do that. But there was another si Œ instance where we stole, ma Œ me and my sister, Stanislawa , younger sister, we Œ we were stealing cabbage, because there was a state farm nearby, and they had their large, I don™t know maybe a acre, or two acres of Œ they were growing regular cabbage, so we would steal the cabbage from that si Œ field. So Œ so Œ but Œ Q: And you didn™t get caught? A: We Œ we didn™t get caught, but we did it during a very bad weather. The storm was terrible, there was raining, and things like that. Nobody would be out at that time, but we were. We Œ we had some sacks, and put some heads of the cabbage into the sacks, brought it home at night. It was Œ Mother right away started cutting this Œ the head Œ the Œ the cabbage, into the sauerkraut, maybe, put in these small containers, and Œ Q: And you had at least some sauerkraut. A: And then we had sauerkraut, yes. Q: Were you hungry in this place? A: Oh, many times, yes, many times were hungry, because food was short and the bread was strictly rationed. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 109 Q: What was it that you ate? What Œ what did Œ were you given to Œ A: Potato, and you Œ basically soup, made with fish. So they would, let™s say, cut the heads off of a fish, and the fish would go to some restaurants or something like that, and the heads, they would make soup with Œ with the heads. So, it was like a clam chowder. Q: A very particular kind of clam chowder. A: Yeah Œ no, but they were heads. Head fishes floating. And it was very popular, yea h. Q: Well, it sounds it Œ also it probably was somewhat healthy, you know, the Œ that as much as there was very little, fish is generally healthy. A: Well, yeah, no, but usually they always Œ there was some Œ some vegetable that they could use Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ make soup. But, as I say basically, they were oh Œ community dining rooms. Q: Yeah. A: And there was a large dining room of tables, and everybody was allowed certain amount Œ Q: Of food. A: Œ food. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 110 Q: Okay. A: So you go to this dining room Œ Q: And you get either Œ A: Œ for breakfast Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ for lunch, and for dinner. And when I was working, I was paid four rubles, and five kopek Œ kopaig (ph). Q: Okay. A: Like five cents. Q: Was that a week ly wage? A: No, daily. Q: That was the daily wage. A: Four rubles, and five kopek Œ kopek . Each food was one ruble. Q: Each time you went to eat. A: Each time you want to eat at the dining, it was one ruble. So Œ and the Œ and the bread that ath Œ were assign, was one ruble and five kopek . So that was my daily wage. I Œ if I wanted to buy all the f Œ bread that I was allowed, then there was nothing left. But sometimes I didn™t buy, I only bought two portions of bread. So I Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 111 spent two rubles, and I had two rubles spared. So then I could do Œ do something else with this money. Q: I see. A: Now there™s Œ Q: I see. A: And that Œ that Œ that was day from day, day after day after day. Q: What happened with the older people? Did people continue to get sick? A: No, they continued to die. There were a lot of people there were dying. Lot of people dying, during the short time that we were there, I would say about 200 people died. And later on I got a better job because I decided to become a shepherd. So re Œ those local Russians who lived there for Œ for many years, they were born there and everything, they were free, right? So they had goats. Each family had one or two goats. So they needed a shepherd to Œ to tend to these goats. So myself and my mother, we decided, you know, to Œ to get that job, or take the job if nobody wanted it, or couldn™t, or whatever. So we Œ what I used to have a Œ a little wooden piece like this on a string, and I had two little pieces of wood, you know, like Œ like the orchestra guy has, you know what that Œ Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 112 A: Œ and I used to do it, pum-pararum -pum, pum-para-rumpum, in the morning, about five o™clock. And these goats start coming out of their sheds on the main road. And when there was ab out 350 - 400 of them gathered together, then I took them to the pasture. And I took care of them during the day, and they were just feeding on Œ on the grass. Q: Right. So you would just mind them. A: I would mind them, take care so no Œ nobon Œ no one was lost. And in the evening I brought them back, and each one knew where Œ where she belongs. You know, it™s funny. I just brought them into this little village, and they Œ they found their own homes, and well Œ Q: And they go back. A: And then I was paid for it by the owners of the goats, and also they gave me milk, or some other things. Q: Well , this is a question I had, when you were out in the pasture, could you milk the goats? A: Oh jeez, no. Q: No? A: I could, but Œ Q: You didn™t. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 113 A: Œ forbid Œ God forbid, I would Œ Q: Ah. A: No, it was strict, strict, everything, you know. And they said, th ey Œ if you did something wrong, by their Œ well, I mean, if there Œ did something wrong, like maybe milk them, or so Œ it™s bad, so you would be punished. Q: Okay. A: Severely. I would be pun Œ la Œ people there are really well aware, well behaved, becaus e they knew that punishment was really severe. Q: Okay. So, but you would be Œ you would be paid sometimes with milk from the goats? A: Yeah, some Œ some people Œ but they were not paid, but they just gave me, maybe a pint of milk, you know, something like Œ some nice people, some owners maybe had two or three goats, so they would give us some milk. Q: Anybody have any chickens? A: Ah, yeah Œ Q: Or was it too cold? A: Œ yeah, yeah, there were Œ there was chickens too, yeah, yeah, good, except that oh you Œ you didn™t have any food to feed them, so what, they were just feeding themselves. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 114 Q: I see. A: But there was no feed to keep these chickens, so how many can you Œ I know that there were some families that had chicken, yes. We didn™t. We did not have, my m other and we didn™ t have, or my father didn™t. They didn™t have anything, yeah . Q: Did people Œ A: Oh, coming back Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ to you Œ you were saying, you know, how Œ how they dress and everything, my sister was also working in the Œ in the forest, cutting this wood down, just like man. So, during the winter, she would have those pants on her, and when she came home, they were like frozen like tubes. Q: Really? A: So she just let them out, you know, get out of this, you know, and put them by the stove to Œ Q: Melt. A: Œ to get warm, to dry. They were standing like you Œ just standing Œ Q: Like a long Œ A: Œ pants. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 115 Q: Yeah. A: And it would just melt and dry, by the next morning it would be dry. Well, that was terr Œ in the summer it™s okay. Q: It™s terrible work, yeah. I mean, you can Œ you can get sick very quickly from this. A: Well sure, of course, that™s why a lot of people lost health. Lot of people suffered later, the Œ you know, later in the life. Q: From all of these conditions. A: Having Œ God thank Œ thank God that it didn™t last too long, because in 1942, we were freed. We were allowed to Œ to leave Russia . Q: Well, I™ll come to that, but before I do, I wanted to ask something about the relations between people Œ not the pe Œ not the prisoners and the administration Œ A: No. Q: Œ but between one another. Did people get Œ did you make friends there? Were people communitic Œ communicative? Did they share their experiences? A: Yes, they shared, but there was no community life. Impossible, you know, everybody w as just work and sleep in the log. Everybody Œ there were no social life, let™s say. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 116 A: No gatherings, nothing. Q: Okay. A: And of course, people would gather to pray together, but it was just on initiative. But there was no church now, the Œ religion was forbidden, officially. But people would still get together to pray, privately. Q: Did you share your log room with another family, or were you Œ did you have the whole room to yourselves? A: No, we Œ we shared it with Œ with my brother Q: Okay, who had lost his children. A: Œ and his wife. Yeah. Q: Okay. How did they Œ how were they coping? I mean, how were they Œ they had lost their children. Did it show, or did they Œ weren™t they ab Œ did they Œ it Œ what Œ didn™t matter. A: No, they were just Œ I don™t know, indifferent really. I mean, they Œ they suffered, but it was so common, every family would lose somebody. Every family that I know of, lost somebody. Or the father died, or mother died, or some of their siblings. Every family lost. So there was people Œ well, I [indecipherable] problem, and just very different, and they didn™t despair, they didn™t [indecipherable] . They were Œ of course they suffered emotionally. But nobody cared. Nobody cared. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 117 Officially, the Russians that were, let™s say, in charge of that area, they didn™t care. You know, they were Œ openly said, you are here to Œ to Œ to die. Q: And they gi Œ and people did. A: Just like [indecipherable] say, there is a word, different word for it, animal death Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and human death. And they would say, you will die like an animal. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Podokneish (ph). You can look it up in a dictionary. Q: So let™s come Œ A: Ah terrible, ah yeah, terrible. And maybe I should also mention that where we lived, there were some Russians that were there before us, and I Œ they were from 1934 when Œ when Stalin deliberately starved a lot of people, or send them to Siberia . But on the other side of the river, there were just a re Œ remains of an old buildings. Nobody lived there, but it was quite a large area maybe, I don™t know, like few blocks of our, maybe five, 10 blocks, completely empty, only ruins. And mostly what Œ what was standing were chimneys, because they were made of brick, and the fireplaces. Because in that old time, there were just fireplaces, and not like gas cookers, or anything like that. Just a box with a Œ with room for Œ for coal or Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 118 wood, and a metal plate on top, where you could boil something. So only those things remained. And I used to go there, and looking for various things, and never found anything. But the ruins were there, large area. Q: And do you know Œ did you ever find out what they were ruins of? A: They Œ yeah, they were the people from way behi Œ way before. I mean, way several years. Let™s say ™35, and this was ™40, so not Œ not that mu Œ long, you know, not that long. Q: I see. A: So, this Œ what do you call it? These Œ this whole area was completely dead, empty, because they say that some kind of disease fell over there. And just Œ Q: Wiped e verybody out? A: Œ wiped everybody, right. So they Œ whoever was left, was moved to the other side of the river, and that™s the Œ the new one, new area where we were Œ Q: I see. A: Œ placed. Q: I see. A: But that™s only regarding this place where I was, Shenchuga . Q: Shenchuga . A: Shenchuga . Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 119 Q: Yeah. A: And the larger place was Poduga . There was a hospital there, and Œ Q: And all of it abandoned. And all of it was abandoned. A: It wasn™t this part Œ yeah, this area was abandoned completely. Only ruins were there. Q: So tell us what happened in 1942. You said Œ you were mentioning that you were allowed to be Œ to leave in 1942. What happened? A: When Œ when the Germany attacked Russia Œ Q: That™s in June 1941. A: June 22nd, 1941, we suddenly became allies with Russia , because Poland had the government in England . Q: Okay. A: There was a government in exile. And we were allied with France , England , and some Œ Ireland , something like that. So we suddenly, since the Germans attacked Russia , we became ally Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ with the ru Œ with Russians. So the Russian says, now you are free, you™re free. You can go a will Œ anywhere you go Œ anywhere you want. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 120 Q: Well, i-if you say that you found out in ™42, it took half a year for you to find out. I mean, from June ™41, di Œ the news didn™t travel too fast. A: No, it™s fa Œ it traveled very fast. Q: Oh, it did? A: Except nobody took any action. We knew that Germany is at war with Russia , we knew that. And the Russian told us right away. It happened in June, but in Œ in si Œ August Œ in August, the Polish government in exile already had an agreement with the Russian government. Q: How did this affect you in Shenchuga , in those months? A: Well, they said, you are free, you can leave, you can go away if you want. Q: Right away they said that? A: Right Œ well, two months later, maybe. Q: Okay. A: Two months. Q: Okay. A: I can Œ yeah. Q: So, no longer were Œ A: Because it was in Œ in Œ in August that we were actually told that we can Œ oh, and they give us papers. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 121 Q: Okay. A: And Œ certificates that we can travel anywhere we want, because before, we couldn™t leave the area. But then we Œ everybody got the certificate, like a travel document or something like that, and people would leave. Some left right away, but we stayed there until June Œ no, June? No, no, January. Until January ™42. On the new year, the first of January, ™42, my family finally decided to leave Russia. Q: And why did it take that extra number of months to make this decision? A: Because they didn™t know what to do, they didn™t know where to go. You couldn™t go back to Poland , because Germans overrun Poland , you know, they were at war with Russia . So Œ and where were Œ people were asking, what are we going to do? Said well, maybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And there Œ then, most of them did go south. But that was later. Q: And did you still continue working under the same conditions after you were told, or d Œ were you given more rations, or were you Œ did your Œ did your everyday rhythm of life change, when you were told in August Œ A: Well, it was only from a psychological point of view that we are free. But av Œ everything just went the same way. Q: Stayed the same. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 122 A: Whoever Œ yes, whoever worked in the forest, you know, they worked in the forest, but they were treated differently. They were free citizens. We were free. So we had something to say, and we had some rights, let™s say, at that time. Because we already had the Polish government in England , who was looking after our interests. So they were talking to the Russian government, and the Russian Œ Russian allowed more freedom, and better Œ better conditions and better pay, and everything else. They started treating us differently. Q: So their behavior was different. A: Absolutely, right. They changed. And like I say, me Œ a lot of people left earlier. Like my brother Frank , the second from the top, he left in August. Q: Right away. A: He left right away. Went to south, Uzbekistan , and we decided, I don™t know why, but my mother and my father were not ready, or didn™t know what to do. So we stayed until the first of January, ™42. Q: Okay. Your brother Jusef(ph). A: Yes. Q: Was he deported with you? A: No. It was entirely different story, as I say. He was running that newspaper in Równa , and when the r Œ Russian Œ Soviet Œ Soviet Union came into Poland , they Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 123 arrested him right away, and we never heard from him, until 19 Œ long, long Œ 40 Œ wait a minute? Forty-three? Forty-four? Maybe we didn™t hear from him at all, we didn™t know what happened to him. But now I know that he was arrested and sent to the Œ the Œ Kolyma . Have you heard of Ko-Kolyma ? Q: Oh yeah, Kolyma . A: He was at Ko-Kolyma , working in the coal mines. Q: I see. I see. And Roman ? A: Roman was with us. Q: Roman was with you. A: Wit h us, yeah. Q: Okay. A: Yes. At that area, that Poselok. Shenchuga . Q: Yeah, yeah . A: So we left together. Q: You all left together, except for Franciczek (ph) [indecipherable] A: Only Frank left sooner. Q: And he left becau Œ did he want to join the Polish army? Was this hi Œ his reason? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 124 A: Yes, exactly right. Exactly right, we Œ we didn™t Œ we ne Œ found out that there is a Polish army being organized in the south of Russia. Q: Okay. A: And that™s where we Œ most of the people decided to leave Russia , go south. And after we reached Uzbekistan , the army sort of extended their protection of Russia, and they took care of us, and [indecipherable] Q: So how did you leave? Before we get to that point, how did you leave that Shenchuga ? Was it Œ it wa Œ was it by sleigh again, or was it on foot, was it with a wagon? How did you leave? A: No, from Œ from the Shenchuga to the railway station, we were by sleigh. Q: Okay. A: Sleigh. We hired it [indecipherable] or whatever. The Russians provided the transportation. Q: Okay. A: And then they also allowed us to use regular passenger trains, at that time, passenger trains. Q: Not cattle cars? A: No, that™s right, and Œ and we didn™t have to pay for the journey. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 125 A: So Œ but Œ Q: And you went by train to Uzbekistan ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes, to Uzbekistan . Q: And then what happened? A: And from Uzbekistan , we were moved to Persia. Iran . Q: In what way, also by train? A: Oh yes, they Œ it was by train. From then on, everything was by train. Q: Okay. A: Or Œ or no Œ part of it was just a freight train again. Q: Yeah. A: But under free conditions, you know, the better conditions and it didn™t last that long, because it was fast, you know, they didn™t put us on the side or anything, didn™t have to wait. It was just from here to there, from Œ from Gouza (ph), or Jakobak (ph), there were to places on the south. We went to Caspian Sea, Krasnovodsk Œ Q: Krasnovodsk , okay. A: On Caspian Sea, and from there by ship to Persia. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 126 Q: Okay, before we get there, when you get to Uzbekistan , what kind of situation do you find there? You know, where do you go to Œ to make sure that you™re in Œ you™re Œ A: It Œ there wasn™t much problem, because when we reached Uzbekistan in February Œ it took two months to get from north to Œ to the south. That I remember, two months, by various means, basically freight train. So when they Œ when we came to Uzbekistan , Polish authorities , which were already trying to help this civilian population, say that we are going to move you away from Russia , into Persia. So, it was a very short period of time, only two weeks when Œ when my mother and sister and I was assigned to leave Russia, in March. Q: Okay. A: And since we came by the end of February, so only a few weeks. And we were already, as far as I™m concerned, ready to leave, and I fell sick with typhus. Typhoid fever. So they couldn™t Œ they didn™t allow me, because the transport was ready to Œ to leave Russia , to Persia , and a Œ we were assigned to this transport, but because of my sickness, I was retained there. Authority says no, you cannot travel, because you™ll spread Œ Q: Typhoid, mmhm. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 127 A: Œ typhoid to other people. So they took me to a hospital, and my mother said, I am staying with you, I am staying with you. I am staying I™m Œ until you get well, and we™ll see what happens. But my brother Roman , he was already in administrative position, he was trying to help all these civilian people get relocated, or taken care of, he says Œ he said, Mother, you leave with my sister, you go, and go to Persia, and I will take care of Tony. Or me. So don™t worry about him, he will be all right. Q: And what about your father? A: Oh, my father died in Russia, we didn™t say anything about that. Q: No, let™s talk about that. But first tell me about this, let™s finish this, then Œ you Œ so you Œ did you Œ is that what happened, that your brother Roman stayed with you? A: Yes, yes. And he says that he told Mother to go, that we Œ we will follow later on, because at that time it was this time on a lot of people were leaving, Polish people were leaving Russia under General Anders . I don™t know whether it™s familiar to you. He was in charge of the Polish army, which was being organized in the south of Russia . He was in charge of everything, civilians, and the military. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 128 A: So from then on we Œ we were really taken care of, because British were already helping to take care of the Pole Œ civilians. Q: Okay, okay. A: Yes. So Mother and Sister left for Persia in March, and I stayed behind Œ Q: With Roman . A: Œ and took me to a hospital, and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital. And when I got well, I was released from the hospital and joined a Polish young soldiers. It was no Œ a sel Œ special unit being organized for the young people, say from 14 to 17. Q: And you were then about how old? A: I was 14 years, 15. Q: Okay. A: Going on 15. So I was accepted to this Polish young army. Q: And Œ and your brother Œ A: Œ ko Œ like a cadet. Q: I see. And Franciczek (ph) had already joined the army? Your Œ the first brother, who left, already joined the army. A: He Œ yes, he was already south, he was safe. Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 129 A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left Russia early. And my mother and sister also left in March, while I stayed behind until August. Q: Oh, that™s quite a while then. A: Yes, quite a while, because then they stopped the transpor Œ transports. I don™t know whose decision it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march Œ exodus I call it, let™s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left Russia . But in August they resumed leaving Œ Q: I see. A: Œ because General Anders was then in charge of the army and everybody that was there, and he negotiated with the Russian people, with the Russian authorities. So, in August they resumed, and they moved about hundred thousand people at that time. Q: Huge number. A: Huge number, but it was all concentrated. August Œ and mainly August, yeah, a lot of people left. Q: And Œ A: And then when Œ I also left Russia. Q: What about Roman ? A: Roman , yes Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 130 Q: Also left at the same time? A: Œ yes, right, yes. Q: So let™s go back now, and talk about what happened to your father. The last you mentioned is he rebuilt this beautiful house. A: Yes, for the administrator there, the main them Œ Q: Right. A: Œ boss of that area . And then he started getting sick. And on Œ on the first, like I mentioned, on the first of January, we le Œ we decided to leave. And he was already very sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17 th day of the journey, he passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm , a place near Ural mountains. He Œ he died, and I Œ I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and he was saying goodbye, and you know, that Œ and he just gave up. And we left him on a platform, because when the train sto Œ I said, Mother Œ it was about one o™clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time Œ the first thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know. They took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are tracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were already about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My Œ Roman , because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 131 railroad platform, without Œ without funeral. We Œ we tried to get some kind of arrangement, but it was impossible, you know, there Œ it™s impossible, just leave here, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put some wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it™s Œ that was the Perm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru Œ you know, communication, rails. That Œ that was the main Œ main system of moving around, either freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare. Q: Was Œ you said he was saying goodbye to everybody in Œ as you were talking to him? A: No, he was Œ we were Œ I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he gave up, then I Œ I woke my mother. Q: Yeah. A: I didn™t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn™t know that. Q: Yeah. A: But it happened during the night, and I Œ I knew when it happens, and then I woke my mother, and Œ and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put him on the platform, and Œ and he was left there, with others. But the death was the normal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can understand that. We were treated Œ I can™t even say. Worse than animals, by t he Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 132 Russians. They didn™t care. Because it Œ that was Stalin™s policy. You are here until you die, but in our case, we were Œ I mean, blessed that it Œ that we did get out of that hell. It was pure hell. People don™t realize like Œ you know, no Œ no clinic, no doctor, no help. No, it Œ they Œ they didn™t care. We die here or there, today, tomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was to get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin™s policy, you know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to survive. Q: Like you said, everybody left Œ A: I Œ I don™t know, I don™t know. I don™t know how to continue, because this is Œ this is the worst. Worst moment of the life. Q: Do you want us to stop for a little bit? A: Oh, I don™t know. Maybe a little, how about Œ Q: Okay, we can Œ we can Œ A: Œ getting some water, or Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ soda. Q: Sure. [break] Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 133 A: Œ the Germans were Œ were leading some prisoners along the road, from one place to another because they were, let™s say, taken to do Œ do some work somewhere. Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home, and there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw potato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started Œ Q: To eat it. A: Œ eating a si Œ a raw potato. But the German pri Œ g-guard, when saw it, he shot him. And he was still eating when he was Œ Q: Falling. A: Œ falling, he was still eating that bre Œ that Œ Q: Raw potato. A: Who Œ who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another? Why Œ why Œ why did we have this concentration camp? Why they™re so Œ you know, mean to each other? Why? Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself? A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being, that they have soul, and responsibility. We Œ we are not vegetable. We are people with feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don™t know, some people don™t believe that, but I Œ I believe. I Œ I™m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 134 another human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I Œ I don™t know. I™ve seen a lot in my life. Q: Did you Œ did you ever question while Œ when you were there, did you ever question your belief? Did you ever think there Œ there can be no God, because a Œ what I™m seeing is so terrible? A: No, this Œ then the Œ no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you know, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how Œ maybe there isn™t. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human being, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav Œ savages to another people, went free. I Œ I cannot imagine that. So I think that there is Œ there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one way or the other. But maybe there isn™t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know, this is probably not for social discussion. Q: Well, actually, these are the key questions. A: Question. Q: Sometimes Œ the-these are the key ones. A: Question that I have chance to raise with you, for instance, you know. Q: Well, I™m glad. A: But we discuss these things, we™re friends, I mean, you know. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 135 Q: Yeah. You know, these are the sort of Œ like, these things that happened, and the people went through, they go to the basic questions of living, and of life. And the questions that you™re raising, are the kind that we wish we could find answers for. A: Yeah. Q: We wish we could know. A: Right. Q: Because how else do you Œ how do you explain such cruelty? How do you explain such things? A: Sure, yeah. Q: You know? A: Yeah. Well, I Œ I talked about it a lot, because my Œ my daughter is married to a American Œ not native American, but an American of so many, many years, let™s say. So they Œ they often want to hear something of what I have to tell them, and sometimes, you know, I wonder if they ever get th-the real feeling what I have to Œ Q: Share. A: Œ share, yeah. Q: Yeah. It™s very hard for Œ for people in societies that haven™t experienced something similar Œ individual people will be able to understand it, but the society Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 136 didn™t go through something like that, so it™s unfamiliar for them. They haven™t Œ they haven™t gone through the same kind of historical trauma. A: No, no, no, of course not. Q: Yeah. But some do, and very well, and very deeply. Let™s continue, and talk about your exodus. When you leave from Krasnovodsk Œ A: Krasnovodsk . Q: Œ vodsk , and over the Caspian Sea. A: Sea. Q: Tell me, what Œ what was that like? Was Œ were you on a boat? Were you on a Œ a little one, a big one? What di Œ what did it look like? A: No, it Œ the journey was done on a oil tanker. There were Œ Q: On an oil tanker, mmhm. A: Œ oil tankers, because they were out of those ships in that area. So they just put us on Œ on top, on Œ on the deck. It was all metal, and if you can imagine August sun beating in that area, which is south, real close to the meridian. Q: Right, me Œ A: It was hot, and the metal deck was really, you know, very, very hot. Q: So, could you cook an egg on it? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 137 A: I guess, yeah. Maybe Œ hey, people said that they would Œ and a lot Œ and lack of water, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these little canteens, so filled with water, maybe say a quart of water in there, and it Œ it Œ journey took three year Œ three days. So, that water didn™t last long, and there was no water to get on the ship. Q: Oh, wow. A: So it was real Œ that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards freedom, we are leaving Russia , so everything was Œ Q: You Œ you bore it Œ A: Œ bearable. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: We Œ we were glad to. And after we disembarked in Pahlevi Œ Pahlavi , in Persia, well, people were just kneeling on the sand, after we got off the tra Œ off the ships in the port, and marched towards the transit area, where there were tents, large tents where we could, you know, relax, and Œ and one thing, there was one tent where the Œ everybody had to go through that. We strip Œ stripped everything down, left. Showers. New, fresh clothes at the other end of the tent, out into the freedom. That was like heaven. Q: Was it? Was it? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 138 A: Yeah. You entered one, leave everything behind, and out the other side. That was Œ yeah. Beautiful moment. That™s when we left Russia. Q: Yeah. A: After Œ Q: So when you said people were kneeling, were they Œ were Œ were they Œ A: Praying. Q: Praying. A: Praying and thanking God for Œ because we knew that everything was in past. Q: Yeah. A: That Œ because the British were taking care of us then. Q: So what happened to you after you went the other side of the tent, and you got a new set of clothes? A: New set of clothes, and I joined the Œ the si Œ they call them young people. It was just like a cadet level, you know, that area. And they gave us uniforms. They were like semi-military uniforms, and they drafted us into this Œ these schools. Q: So you were 15 and a half? A: Yeah, that™s about right, yes. Well Œ Q: Sixteen? A: Œ 15 Œ 15 Œ ™42. It was in ™42. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 139 Q: August ™42. A: Yes. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: So, two and a half years after you™re deported, you™re in Iran. A: Right. Q: You™re in Persia. A: In Persia . Q: And so you started going to Œ did you see your si Œ did you make connection with you r sister and your mother? A: Unfortunately no, because they were always ahead of me. When I came to Œ to Persia, I found out that they left for Africa two weeks Œ Q: Before. A: Œ before we arrived there. Q: What did Roman do? Did he join the milit Œ A: Rom an saw them. Because like si Œ I said, he was in administrative position, so he was taking care of these movements and how the transports were coming in, so he would register them, and say you go here, you go here, you know. So he had Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 140 possibility to Œ to m eet a lot of people, and he saw Mother and Œ and Œ and daughter Œ and Œ Mother and Sister. Q: Yeah.

So then tell Œ tell me a little bit about these experiences of guarding them. A: Oh gee. Well, we Œ we were Œ we were just soldiers, we were Œ carried orders. I mean, we Œ I didn™t have any animosity to them, or anything like that. Q: Was there any communication? A: He was just another person, he was another human being, so we Œ we talked, and everything.

A: By mimicking, or some of them knew some English. So Œ so, it was Œ if we needed to, yes, I talked to some of them. But there was no much communication. They were on the one side of the fence, and I was on the other side of the fence, and I was armed, and that™s it. But Œ Q: The Œ in the cadet school in Egypt , did you actually fly any Œ any plane, as training? A: I nev Œ I ne-never trained for a pilot, but I trained for a mechanic , aircraft mechanic.

A: So, there was a large British air unit, a huge maintenance unit near Cairo, and they Œ they would fly those partly damaged planes, or just brought them in some [indecipherable] and we had to fix them. So that™s what I worked on, B-17s, was a maintenance pe-person, fixing engines and other parts that were Œ needed the repair. And after that, I was transferred to England , but it was already after the war. Q: Yeah. A: Cause I came to England in 1947, at the end of 1947.

Q: And when Œ when Œ I want to ask two questions of Œ you know, sort of like Œ A: Sure, no, go Œ Q: Œ the particular moment that the war ended. Where were you when you found out the war is over? A: In Egypt . Q: And what were you doing? A: In Œ in that Polish air force school. Q: So were you actually in school, and the Œ somebody comes Œ A: In uniform, yes, yes, yeah. Q: And someone comes into the classroom and says the war is over. Is that what happened? A: Well no, I think it happened in a little different occasion, I mean, it Œ I think it was over the weekend. Wasn™t it Saturday, or something like that, when the war ended? Q: Uh-huh. A: And oh, it was all over radio. We had radios there and everything else. Oh, war is Œ yeah, I was in uniform at that time, and we celebrated with the a Œ with the Americans, and there was a huge American base close to us, or we were close to Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 148 them. And then there was amer Œ the English. So we all got together, we Œ we Œ we had a good time. Q: Quite different from the beginning of the war. A: It was a very, very joyous occasion. Q: Yeah. And then the second moment is when Œ do you remember when you saw your family again in England ? Was Œ what was that like? A: Oh yeah, it was Œ I actually greeted my mother when she was brought from Œ from the port to the camp. There were civilian camps. Camps for the civilian population who was either in Africa or in India , they were all coming to England . England decided to Œ Q: Bring them [indecipherable] A: Œ receive them, you know, offer them life in Œ in England . So I was still in the uniform in the air force, I was in the Polish air force, as a regular airman. And when they came to the camp, I was there, and I Œ you know, the trucks Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ military trucks would bring those civilian people to the camp, and we just greeted, and she recognized me, I recognized her, of course, because we were corresponding and exchanging photographs. Q: Mm-hm. But it had been six years. Six years since you had seen her. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 149 A: It™s a Œ since ™40 Œ ™42. Yeah, since ™42 where they left, yeah. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: And Œ and they left in March of ™42, sadly, yeah, that™s where I was also ready to leave, but because of my sickness Œ Q: You couldn™t. A: And then after they Œ one more thing, when I Œ when they took me to the hospital and I lost consciousness or Œ for two weeks I didn™t know what Œ what was going on. And after I regained consciousness, I started looking in my ba Œ military pack, you know, backpack, and I found a piece of paper. You know, some official Œ official piece of paper. And I looked at it, and it looked like a telegram. So I looked at it closer. It wasn™t for me, it was addressed it to my brother Joseph . Q: Really? A: Yes, and somebody, the military mail got screwed up, and they deliver it to me, while was in the hospital in Russia . And after looking at this, I say what Œ what is this? So I started asking, I say yeah, this unit is about five miles from here. So Œ Q: So you knew Œ you hadn't known what had happened to your brother all this time? Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 150 A: Exactly. That™s Œ you know, when we met in Russia , after that, and I went to that unit, and he was there, Joseph . So again, by that mistake of the telegram being delivered to me Œ Q: And what Œ A: Œ instead of to him. Q: When did he leave Russia? When did he leave the Soviet Union ? A: Well, in Œ in Œ in ™42. Q: But Œ in August, with the August transports? A: Yes, yes, he left with the army, he joined the army. Q: Okay. A: Polish army, and Œ in the south of Russia. Q: And what was his pattern? Did he go to Palestine as well, and to Œ A: Yes, he Œ we went through Iraq , or Persia , Iraq, Iraq , Palestine . And from there they went to Italy , and fought the campaign Œ Q: At Monte Cassino ? A: Yes, he was at the Monte Cassino , ri ght, yeah. Q: And where did he end up, after the war? A: He was in Italy for a while. After the war ended, the Polish unit, because Polish second corps, under General Anders, was still complete, as a unit, in Italy . So he Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 151 met his future wife there, in Italy. He Œ she was Polish girl also. So he married her, and the unit, the whole Polish corps under General Anders was moved to England . And Œ Q: And he ended up there, too. A: Œ she Œ she came along, and they were already married, and then we were all let go, into the civilian life, and he started his own life in England . Q: And your other two brothers Œ your other two brothers, as well? A: The other two brothers also came to England , same way. Their wives came from Africa, they joined in England , and Roman an d Frank , and we all got Œ Q: And your two sisters? A: Œ settled in Wolverhampton . Q: And your two sisters, Stanislawa , and your other sisters? A: M-Maria . Q: Maria. A: Maria, Maria . She Œ she was in Poland all the time. Q: Oh, so she never got deported? A: During the war. They Œ she never Œ she was never taken away from Œ from Poland . Q: Okay. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 152 A: So she spent the war in Œ in Poland , and was un-until she died, only a few years ago. But yeah.

Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 153 Q: And why? Why? A: Why? I don™t know, I Œ it probably just a little stretched, what I am going to say, but England at that time Œ let™s say I left England in 1956. After the war Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ England became socialized Œ socialist Œ socialist country. And they really lean towards the left, towards communist. The Œ the soc ialist government under Attlee, Premier Attlee , etcetera, you know. And they were buddy-buddy with the Russians. And I say, well, let™s get as far away as possible. So where we go? We go to the United States . And I was already married. Q: I see, you married in England . A: Yeah, I lived in England for 10 years Œ Q: That™s a long time. A: Œ before I came to United States . But I think, at least, this is what I believe now. Q: Okay. A: And I tell people that it was too close to comfort. Q: Too close for comfort. A: No, no, I mean it was, anyway, because I thought England was getting too bar Œ too friendly with the Russians. And I said, who knows? Maybe they™ll Œ Q: They™ll come back. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 154 A: Œ they™ll take me back to Russia . Q: And you moved to Chicago? A: Yes, straight to Chicago , right, straight to Chicago. Q: Okay.

I was a diplom Œ the diploma in mechanical engineering, and I started working. As soon as I finished the education, I started working as an engineer, with Eveready company. Q: Oh. A: And from then on, it was just real nice. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: And the same thing here? A: Yes, and I came to United States on Saturday, on a Monday I was already in my position as a electrical engineer. Q: Well, congratulations. A: Over the weekend, because Œ Q: Not bad. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 155 A: Œ they Œ yes, I Œ I had a agreement with the company that if I come to United States, they will hire me.

Q: Yeah. A: There is a picture of her. Q: A picture. Beautiful. Is there anything else you™d like to add to what we™ve spoken about today? Anything you would want your grandchildren, and other people™s grandchildren to understand about what you went through, what you experienced? A: Well, I Œ I must say that my two granddaughters, lovely two granddaughters, they are very intelligent, and Œ and they Œ ever since they were small children, when I was talking about my experiences, let™s say to Œ to my son -in-law™s family, he has a family in Minnesota , my son-in-law. So they were always interested in hearing my stories , just like now. Maybe not to the full extent Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 157 A: Œ like now. So, as the Œ the Œ the little girls, they were playing somewhere, you know, etcetera. Then suddenly, they were asking me questions. Says, how do you know? Oh, I Œ I listen to you. Yes, and they are one in Chicago , and one other is in Minneapolis . Both very bright young ladies. Q: And do they understand? Do you feel that they understand? A: Yeah, I Œ I feel that they understand, yes. They understand, and I say Œ I was surprised, you know, how they ne Œ heard almost Œ I mean, they were never in the same , say company, they were playing somewhere Œ Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Œ in the same room, though. But she remembered, especially the Œ t he younger one, they say, oh Dziadziu Œ dziadziu means grandpa, yes, I remember how you were talking, you know, about your experiences, and Œ and they were interested, and still are, you know. Q: Here™s ano Œ here™s a question I don™t often ask, but what would you want the young people of their generation, who live in Russia, to understand about what you went through? Because they won™t hear about it yet from history books. They may at some point. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 158 A: Yes. Q: But what would you want them to understand about this experience, these years that you spent there? A: I don™t expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how fragile is the human character, or something, that you know, people can change from being very nice, to being really like an animal to one another. Which I think you have to be conscious of it and be careful, because you never know what these people are capable of doing to one another. This is, unfortunately, my experience. And I Œ I hope that this will never happen to anybody, the way it happened to me. But they should be aware of the human frailty, or human Œ I don™t know what it Œ what it is really Œ that is capable of changing the character of a Œ of a person. Q: That we have it in us, and even if we don™t know we do. A: I do not understand. I do not understand how can people be so mean to each other. They can be a friend and they so mean. Q: Yeah. A: It Œ it™s Œ to me, it™s against the human nature. People should be friendly to each other, helpful. Extend your hand, if you can . Don™t Œ don™t push away the extended hand, or be friendly. There Œ there is no friendliness among people. And that Œ Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 159 that™s very disappointing. Very disappointing. I Œ even now I says, why do people fight each o-other, all over? Q: And these are the things Œ A: There Œ there are some bad, bad people, like the Œ you know, those terrorists and everything say, but they are bad, they are criminals. But I™m talking about the average person. Q: Yeah. A: You know, average person. He can be so nice to you, and you can be friend, and everything. Something may happen. Q: Well Œ A: And they Œ they destroy each other, or th-they are mean to each other. Then that hurts me. The meanness of some people. I think I am very friendly to everybody. I am. I™m sure of it. Q: Thank you for sharing all this with us today, despite the cost, and I know there is a cost to it. And I appreciate that openness, and that generosity. A: I™m very Œ oh, I am happy that there is a person who wants to listen to it. Q: There is. And not only me. A: And understand Œ try to understand. Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. Interview with Anthony Chudzik January 24, 2015 160 A: You see, I am 88 years old. How can I influence anybody? Q: It™s amazing. I think you can. It™s amazing how people can. And I appreciate your trying. A: There is not a lot opportunity. Q: Mm-hm. Well, I want to thank you for this interview today. A: Well, you™re welcome, and I Œ I thank you, that you listened, and recorded it. Q: Yeah, yeah. And I™ll then say that this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Anthony Chudzik on January 24 th, 2015, in Westchester , Illinois . Thank you very much.
