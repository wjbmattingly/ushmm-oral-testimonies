I was in the barracks for families because I came in with my mother. And then were the barracks for young men, separated. And the joke was I never went into the barrack. I didn™t Œ I wasn™t interested to go into the barrack with all the guys. And one day, in Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 49camp, there was a Œ for some reason they built a swimming pool in camp. I think the reason for it was, what they did in Theresienstadt, to Œ when somebody comes in, some Red Cross or something, they show them how good they treat the people. I don™t know.

He was not officially the director any more, but he was. And he wa s there visiting because his sister was in camp with two boys. Her two boys were thre e and six years old. We brought them in 1968 here, because my sister-in-law took them into the home after, because these two boys, the mother with the two boys were caught and taken to be shot. But they did not shoot the boys, because the peas ant who Œ there was one woman peasant, there were two little boys, nice looking, good little boys, with the mother, and they were going to shoot them three. And the pe asant begged the German soldier, give me the boys, I don™t have any children. So they told her, take them. Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 52Q: Like kittens. A: Yeah, take them.

So then we went into Banská Bystrica , the family of Poles had friends there, so we went with them in Œ they had a house there, so we stayed with them, and they took me along, because when we came out of the camp, we picked up Paul™s whole family. Q: So you, more or less, was it like you broke out of that camp Œ A: No. Q: Œ or had the Hlinka guards disappeared?

Then we went from there, we tried to go in the mountains, if somebody let us in or not Œ I have also somewhere in my papers, and I might find it. When I find the papers, I™ll let you know. Q: Okay. A: Okay? Q: Okay. A: There was a school principal in the village. This is all in the mountains. And he had the Œ he took us in for a couple of days, until we found something else. He took us in in the Œ behind in the [indecipherable] same school, the room behind the wall, he had two very badly injure d partisans, French partisans, whom he saved the life, yes.

We did not know [indecipherable] we knew. So just [indecipherable] Q: Can I ask a question at this point? Woul d you say that you th Œ I don™t know how to phrase it, but some people just put it bluntly. A: Bluntly. Q: Did you look pa Œ did you look particularly Jewish? A: Me? Q: Yes, and Paul.

But [indecipherable] and the neighbors came running and said, did you hear the shooting? And a peasant to Œ said, don™t worry about that, they only shoot Jews, they don™t shoot our people. So they didn™t know who we were, we were just refugees. Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 66Q: Got it. A: Another little thing that maybe doesn™t make sense to record, or something Œ Q: No, it does make sense. A: We had the baby carriage, with the little baby, four months old baby.

Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 67Q: Yeah. A: Next what is? Next day we found a place where they would let us stay as Slovak refugees. They didn™t know we were Jewish. Q: So here li Œ here™s another question so that I™m clear. At first you said it was you and Paul who was going from village to village, but it was also Œ it was a larger group of people. A: Was his mother, his sister, her hus band, the baby, and the two of us. Q: Okay. His mother, brother, sister, baby Œ so, six of you. A: I never counted. Q: Doesn™t matter. But it Œ not just a couple. In other words, a family. A: But we went out when we needed to go look for another place. Q: I see. So you were kind of like the scouts. A: Sometime, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Something like that. Q: Okay. So can we consid er that from August when Œ you know, the Œ the guards just opened the place of Novaky , you escaped, and now you were in some ways in hiding. A: After we did what Œ after we did what was supposed to be done, yes. Q: Yeah, yeah. Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 68A: Then we went for his family. Q: Yeah, then you went for his family, and then you started hiding, from one place to another, I see. A: Yeah. Q: Okay.

So I Œ I decided to put it in Œ you know, they used to call it Œ in prison it™s umschlag . It was, you put somebody with high fever, a baby, in a sheet with lukewarm water, and it cools it off.

Q: How long did this wandering last? A: The wandering lasted from August ™44 to April ™45. Q: Wow. So a good eight months. Interview with A lice Tyroler May 8, 2013 69A: A few months. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: A good Œ over half a year. A: Then we went to another one, I told you. Not as Jews, it™s just the Slovak peasants, who had to leave because there was something going on. Q: Right. A: And there was something very interesting, because how do you have Œ yeah, somebody wa Œ became suspicious, and there was an old man, the Œ the patriarch of the family. And he was sitting in a room, and he called me in. And he started to ask me questions. Either he heard the language , and it wasn™t as good as the others or something. And I knew everything. I knew my name, from Alice we got Aloyasia (ph) Œ yeah, I forget to tell you then, in one of the villages, Paul went to the German Kommandatura and got papers for everybody.

And he called me in a room and he asked me the questions and everything, and the holidays, which I knew exactly because I am very, very versed Œ Q: So, Christian holidays. A: I am very well versed, yeah, because Nanny taught me. She wanted me to know every Œ both. Q: Okay. A: And Œ until he asked me one question.

That™s how he caught me. So he sent Œ in a snowstorm he sent his son for the priest. The priest came in the night, through the snow. And the priest came, and he told him that this Œ she sam Œ she seems to be Jewish or something, she™s not a Slovak. She™s either a Gypsy or something, we don™t know. So the priest told him to let me go in a separate room with him, he will ask me.
