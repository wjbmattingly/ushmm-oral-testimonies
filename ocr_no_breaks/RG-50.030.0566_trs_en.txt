Answer: Silver Spring. Q: Silver Spring, Maryland. Thank you Mr. Baer for Œ A: Baer. Q: Baer, for coming to speak with us today. An d as I said in our introduction that was not on tape, what we™d like to do is start at the very beginning. Where were you born; did you have si blings; what was your family ci rcumstances Œ what were your family circumstances; who were your mother and father? A: Fine. Q: So maybe we could start there. A: My Œ my name is Joachim Baer . I was born in Hamburg in December 20, 1929. I have a sister who is about four years older than I am. My father was a physician, he was a Zionist, and he didn™t look Jewish. And he had good pair Œ relation with patient. Interesting enough, my Œ the patient always talked to the Œ to the Œ the doctors, and they told my father that Hitler is building tanks and preparing Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 4for war. And he make a statem ent and everyone thought that he is crazy, that he say that Hitler is going to gas the Jews. Q: Who, this man? A: No, my father make that sta Œ Q: Your father Œ your father made the statement. A: Œ ke Œ statement that that™s what he™s going to do. And most people thought my father is crazy. Q: Yeah. A: And that was the atmosphere that time. And interesting enough, my w Œ my wi Œ my mother was afraid to go to Palestine , that was like a desert land. And in 1933 they took a ship and went to Palestine to see if you can live there. And then he saw that™s not so terrible, and that™s when he start making pr eparation. But the t-turning point was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician cannot have any more non-Jewish patient. And my father was a doctor like [indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his busine ss. So that was a turning point, and he say, it™s time to go. Q: Can I i-interrupt just for a second? A: Mm-hm. Q: Because I™d like to even step back a little further. Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 5A: Okay. Q: You were born in 1929. A: Right. Q: And with a sister who was four years older. A: About, yeah. Q: Okay. And your father was a physician. A: Right. Q: Did your mother work outside the home, or was she at home? A: No, no, she was a homemaker. Q: Do you count yourself as a well-to-do family because your father was a physician, or was that not as such a prestigious post as it is in the United States, for example? A: Well, doctors in Germany, they didn™t wa Œ didn™t make that kind of money like they do in the United States. But we had a very nice apar tment, and he had a office near the harbor, because his specialty was venereal disease. Q: Ah, venereal diseases. A: And Œ yeah, and so he had to have all those sailor, which had syphilis. In those days there was no penicillin to cure them. So they suffer and it was a booming business, so to speak. Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 6Q: I can imagine, because there was that section in Hamburg , isn™t there, where there™s Œ what is it called now? A: Yeah, there Œ yeah, the Œ the Reeperbahn. Q: Reeperbahn, yeah, exactly. A: Yes, yes, yes, yeah. So Œ so we were well-to-do, but I mean, the Œ it Œ the Œ Q: Did you have servants at home? A: Yes, we had a dienstmädchen, you know, for the kids. Q: A nanny. A: A nanny, and we had, I th ink, another help, we had about s-seven, eight rooms, I don™t know. It was a Œ it was well-to-do, nice neighborhood. But we didn™t go Œ the thing is, he was Œ I don™t know what time, when he got to Hamburg to settle down, but it was not too many years. Q: Oh, so he wasn™t from Hamburg? A: No, no, no. He was born in Posen , which is in east Germany, so to speak. Q: Correct. A: And then after World War I, Posen turned to be Poland. Q: That™s right. A: So the family went and settled down in Berlin. Q: I see. Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 7A: And the reason we got to Hamburg , because my father needed to have a harbor where the sailor comes. My father was high intellect person, and he knew all the language, Norwegian [indecipherable] so he could talk to all the sailors. Q: Sailors. A: Yeah. Q: I wonder what he Œ if there was no penicillin, what kind of treatment he did give them. A: Was a very unpleasant treatment. It wa Œ was a Œ Q: Tough. A: Œ was a Œ was a tough, yeah, it was a tough one, right. So, the thing is, one Œ how we got to Œ my mother wanted to go first maybe to Europe. And she and my father say no, if we go, we get out of Europe. Q: Oh, wo-would your Œ I™m still back in Berlin. A: Oh, oh, okay. Q: Yeah, I really want to start at the beginning, before the politics. A: Okay, okay. Q: So, was your mother from Posen as well? A: No, she was from Marineburg (ph) with Auspoyzen (ph), you know, was the same. And Œ Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 8Q: So, Auspoyzen (ph) near Königsburg ? A: No, she was Marineburg(ph) , was a Œ Q: Marineburg (ph) is Œ A: Œ was a small town.

And my father came from a Zionist background family. My mother not. My father was Œ came from a religious, not Œ not super Orthodox, but conservative Orthodox family. And my mother had very little Yiddishkeit, so to speak. So he was a Œ he was a philosopher too. I mean, he knew Shea, he knew Spinoza and he knew th-the Bible, and he was a high inte llected person. He gave speeches, he was the president of a synagogue and [indecipherable] . So he was a Œ Q: What are your first memories of your parents? Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 9A: Well, they were very nice parents, I mean, they were very lovely to me and as Œ my sister. And he was high intellect, so he used to take me for a walk and show me the Œ the Œ the st Œ the stars, and this is the big [indecipherable] there™s the smaller [indecipherable] . And he gave lectures, and you know, so it was Œ and I had problem with my Bible, he always explained to me. So he was high intelligence. Q: And do you have memories of Hamburg itself, of the apartment that you lived in? A: Yeah, well, interesting, I remember Œ see Œ see, the harbor was a main port. And one day my father had a patie nt, a captain on the ship. So he mem Œ he took me, I think with my mother, for dinner, whatever it is, on this Œ on th-the captain table. An orange was a big sensation those days, an orange. So Œ so as I wi Œ wouldn™t be caught in a Œ in a custom, I put the orange in my little ba Œ in my little coat. So this way we went though the custom. Q: So, in other words, in order to be guests of the captain on the ship, you ha Œ you were leaving the territory of Germany, and had to go through customs? A: Well, any time when you go in and out the harbor, you have to go through a checkpoint, you know. Q: I see. A: You have to do this a ll over the world, you know. Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 10Q: How old we Œ how ol d were you at the time? A: Five years. Q: Oh, so it™s the sort of thing a five year old would remember. A: Yeah. The thing is, I Œ only the [indecipherable] thing I remember, there was a Greek boy in our building and I used to play with him. And one day he didn™t want to play with him. So I came to my mother, oh, crying, he doesn™t want to play with him. But the reason he wouldn™t play me, because he knew I am Jewish, and Jewish was taboo. But my sister, who was 10 years old, she knew what was going on, and she really was so relieved getting out of Germany, because she knew what™s going on. Q: That Œ those few years made a huge difference. A: Yes. Also, my Œ my sister was very Œ she got my intelligent of my father. She knew what exactly. Also, she went to a Jewish school. Q: I see. A: The Mädchen school. Q: And you were Œ were you already going to school when you left? A: No, this Œ I was too young. Q: Yeah.

And I didn™t get it. So I really was Œ I didn't suffer from the Holocaust, we Œ only this instant from the boy. Bu t my sister, she knew what was going. Hamburg was a liberal city. I know I have a friend of mind who was from Königsburg , and that sh Œ the parents sent him to Hamburg, because Hamburg was more liberal. And he went to Talmud Tora Schule, which was the school for the boys. And my sister went to the Mädchen Schule . And Œ Q: Mm-hm, the school for the girls. A: Œ yeah [indecipherable] we were invited by the German Œ city hall you can call it, a-and my sister came from Israel and I came from here, and we visited Mädchen Schule and there were paperwork for my sister, me s Œ playing on the shoka(ph) there, and Œ Q: Oh Œ oh, you mean a phot ograph of you playing on Œ A: No, they ha Œ ha Œ a memory book with painting and all that.

Interview with Joachim Baer March 1, 2010 40A: Yes, it™s Œ someone asked me, what is the most in Œ who was Œ who Œ who Œ who affected your life the most? And my answer is Hitler.
