Because they had been warned and knowing other American's solders were, it it's pretty hard with all the stuff we had not to give them something. And some of them, some of them did feed um, but that was in my position our hardest thing and we talked about how how bad they looked. We talked about that and wondered. We had, we didn't know too much about the all the camps that had been liberated or really at that time all the atrocities that had gone in the camp. Uh in fact there the only men, basically all we saw were were men in this camp. I I can't recall seeing any any children or women. That's all I saw was were men. SWB: JOE KAHOE: No No. No....

Or let them have hurt themselves because in many cases, you know, they came so close to the vehicles uh it wouldn't have take too much for some of them to fall and get run over and what not. I imagine people gave them cigarettes if if they asked for any. But I don't think, it didn't look to me that they were in ah ah begging type mood.

But I could see you could see where it was pretty hard for them to really smile, no laughing or anything like that. I guess there were some smiles in the bunch. But they had a real solemn look. You could you could see that they were they were glad to be away but they were not in a position to just be smiling like they had won a football game or anything like that.
