What was the language that you spoke at home with your parents? A: At home? At home we had actually two languages. The parents spoke between themselves in Russian, and sometimes in Polish, but with us they all spoke Polish. Q: Always Polish, yeah? A: Polish, yes. Q: Did anybody speak Yiddish at home? A: Thanks God, no. I tell you why I say thanks God. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 6 Q: Tell me. A: Because Yiddish Œ people that spoke Yiddish, they couldn™t survive. You don™t know why. You see, peop Œ nobody will tell you this Œ Q: Tell me. A: Œ but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very heavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish, they can™t get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know, they Œ i-i-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they couldn™t Œ they couldn™t save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many thousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. It™s very unusual, but that™s is true, I bi Œ nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. It™s not offensive, it™s just actually, this is how it is. Q: Mm-hm. Did Œ A: Yeah, go ahead. Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn™t speak Polish, or they spoke it with an accent? A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh Œ ss Œ shtetls, you Œ like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, but Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 7 most people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish , you know. Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in Œ in that they spoke Polish and Russian, or Œ A: Absolutely not. Q: Okay. A: They been Œ we [indecipherable] . It™s better Œ my father, he preferred to have a kosher food. Q: Okay. A: But you know, from this you cannot Œ you change the type of food, and nobody knows who you are, you know. But the language you cou Œ you couldn™t get rid of it. Q: No. A: It™s just Œ it™s Œ yeah. Q: It™s an accent, or it™s a Œ A: It™s accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that™s Œ many people died because of this, but see, I am the first one that™s not afraid to tell about. Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother Œ A: Okay.

So we should be careful how we ride. So this kind of shocked me. But the worst place was name Œ in the city named Siedlce .

Q: So you experienced the Soviets coming in to the other part of Poland ? A: Til then we left this Œ Q: Tell me, what did you see? When Œ when that happened, what did you see? A: What I see? I se Œ I see the Soviets arrive the first time my life, and I was thinking, what a primitive army it is, they have the Œ I Œ I haven™t seen many cars, but I see horses pulling the cars, or some artillery, etcetera, you know. And it was kind of interesting for me to see it, how™s it Œ because I Œ I never know about how™s Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 72 it look like. And the Œ and then, you know, of course they Œ they already started to have their own police, it started to be kind of more like a Œ like a Gestapo driving other way, you know. Q: Mm-hm. And th Œ and so we Œ you don™t remember the name of this border town that you stayed Œ A: Yes, I do, I Œ I wrote it, but same here again. I don™t Œ it™s in Œ in my book, you know. I don™t remember at this moment here. Q: Okay. A: But it was a si Œ very small town. Q: How long did you stay there, do you think? A: Maybe a few days, because the Soviets dec-decided in few days that they take the rest of the Œ of the Œ half of the Poland, you know. Q: That™s right. A: Half Œ just half. Q: And Œ and then where did Œ where did your father think that you needed to go? Then where did he say where you should try to head?

A: Okay now, this Œ this was in times that the Soviet decide that Œ Soviet decide that the Œ they gave temporary to Lithuania . You remember this time? Because you should [indecipherable] because you are from Vilnius . They Œ they give it, so that everybody was happy, now we™re going to free Lithuania , you know, democratic country, you know, we know Lithuania from very plus side, you know, was democratic country, free, free. So there was just fantastic things to go there. Q: Okay, so that Œ A: And I never real Œ I never forget when we come to this Lithuanian, I™ve seen the Œ the guys, you know, big, with these hats, they have kind of long hats, you know Œ Q: Tall guys with long hats. A: Yeah, yeah. I remember this. And there was freedom, you know, it was lot o f food. At one time peanut Œ peanut fla Œ peanut satrous (ph). I don™t the names. Q: Peanut santros (ph). A: Yeah, nat Œ yeah. So was food and everything, just free , you know. Q: So that Œ okay. But before you get there, you™re still in this village in Œ or this town close to the Soviet border. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 74 A: Yes. Q: And your father does not feel safe enough to stay there, because if you™re in the Russian zone, you™re not Œ the Œ the Germans don™t come to you. A: Don™t come, sure. Q: Okay. A: Because they divided Œ Q: That™s right. A: Œ Poland in half. Q: All right. A: At that time. Q: Okay. Why would he leave? Why would he just not stay there, or go further into the Soviet Union? A: Well, you know, because you know, the Œ we Œ we know the difference between Soviet Union and free Lithuania , you know, democratic country, you know. What Œ what the difference, like day and night, you know. Q: Okay. So he decided to l eave there Œ A: Of course. Q: Œ and go north. A: Of course, yeah. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 75 Q: All right. How long did that journey take? A: Probably couple days or something, you know. There was a Œ was also very complicated because on the way the Soviet police kind of catch a Œ catch [indecipherable] requires a hou Œ the Œ the car, you know, the car was something. So what they did, they diz Œ my father and Œ and my uncle disabled the car. So we hire horses to pull the car, pretending that Œ Q: It doesn™t work. A: Œ it doesn™t work. I tell you, everything is so unbelievable, huh? You Œ I tell you everything Œ and this is before is Œ the most interesting part that they told about the movie, that this is just a movie. But I Œ I was thinking something else, you know. I was thinking there is so much material that you sh Œ you cann ot make one movie from this, so you know, like in Œ in the TV was one time like four different parts, or something? That™s what it should be, because it™s too much in one Œ one thing. Q: There™s a lot to Œ there™s a lot of ground to cov Œ A: This unbelievable. Q: Yeah. A: It wa Œ it Œ very kind of things that people are not familiar with, you know, and you can make like far Œ four or five, you know, parts, you know, and Œ Q: Well, one of the things that we don™t often hear Œ Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 76 A: Yeah.

A: Œ pull this Œ we should hire somebody to pull th Œ pull us, you know, out of the other side of the Œ of the river, you know. Q: That™s not easy. A: No, you know [indecipherable] Q: And what about were Œ were there many other people on the roads? A: No, no, not really. I have Œ we haven™t seen the Œ I Œ I don™t remember seeing a single car, except the one which police had tried to catch [indecipherable] Q: What about from to Warsaw ? Was the road Œ when you first left Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ to Warsaw itself, was it filled with soldiers, was it filled with other people trying to leave the city, or was that empty too? A: Not really.

A: Well, I think maybe Œ maybe months, or so. Q: Oh, not very long, okay. A: Or maybe one and a half months, something Œ something like this. Q: Okay. A: Because he was not very long in this Œ Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 124 Q: In this , okay. A: Œ in the prison, and Œ but they Œ if not this that they Œ he probably would sit forever there, but if not that they decided evacuation of Œ of this Polish element, you know?

A: Œ this is good enough to be sent out Œ are enemies. Q: Okay. Now it™s clearer to me. Now it™s clearer to me and Œ and you a nd your mother are Œ aand ya Œ and your sister, you™re in fear and nervousness cause they could be coming for you. If they come for people from Warsaw , why wouldn™t they come for people for ? A: Definitely. Q: Okay. A: Definitely. Plus, you know, we also have a fear because Father was arrested.

Q: Œ Poland itself, not the Soviet part Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ but he also has been arrested. A: Yeah. Q: So now tell me, why was this a good thing? Why did this end up being a good thing? A: Great, great, absolutely great, it save our life, you see, uh-huh? Q: Okay. A: Because, you know, because he was, as I say, he was very big optimist. In case he was not arrested and let™s say that the Germans come and he was free from jail. And then they open the ghetto. So, you know, even my mother sometimes said, you know, maybe we should go to ghetto. I Œ if you read it, it says that I said no way. Q: Okay. A: My father would say yeah, because we™ll manage somehow. He Œ he was optimist, you know? Q: So he would have been Œ had he been released Œ A: He wa Œ he would Œ he may Œ yeah, he would ga Œ he would go, I™m sure about it. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 126 Q: Okay. A: Because he figure out with his ideas, etcetera, you know, he will be okay. But you know, because he was not there, it was my idea, and we survived. Q: Oh. A: Yeah.

So in order to bring the food, they throw some kind of wire, so I should tie it on this, the basket, or whatever it is, and they lift it. Q: They lifted it. A: They couldn™t o Œ there was no window, you know, or door was locked, you know. So this way, you know, I could give them the food or drink, or whatever, you know. Q: And did he say anything to you while he was Œ A: Yeah, of course, you know, he was just a Œ enjoyed that I was there, he was Œ it was no words, you know Œ you know, things, situation like this.

Q: So, did you feel Œ did you feel this mask that you had to wear, did you feel a Œ a kind of tension for having to pretend that you were not who you were? A: Well, of course that Œ with time I got used to it and I know how to deal with this, but from beginning I should be very, very careful, you know, because I didn™t yet have the experience, you know, to be suppose dly Pole Œ pretending to be Pole, and not Jewish, of course. But I learn Œ in time I learn what should I do, and how should I do, and it takes time, you know. Q: Yeah. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 164 A: I remember that when I should Œ you know, the Œ the Poles in these areas had been absolutely religious.

A: Yeah, I me Œ I knew. Q: Yeah. A: And I Œ and this was first time that I walked to church, I was very careful that I don™t make any mistakes. So the way how I do, I do very slow, and I look on others, what they are doing, you know. And Œ and you know, this [indecipherable] kneeling, you know, and I do th Œ a little later than they, because it takes time to figure out. But I think that I did okay, you know. But I looking on my mother Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and she makes so many mistakes, I was so afraid, you know. Eventually she learned too, but you know, first time she went, so many mistakes, you know. But eventual I was perfect, you know. I just do perfect. It would have been perfect, the priests, they loved me. The priest, you know, they Œ they asked me to Œ to Œ to help with the mass, you know. Q: So you Œ they asked you to be an altar boy? Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 165 A: Yeah, altar boy. Yeah, I was Œ Q: Were you an altar boy? A: Oh yes, yeah, I was altar boy.

Q: What was Œ what was about this man that was terrible? Can you tell us? A: He was a sup Œ he was a Œ we knew about him that he was also participating in some kind of terrible thing, you know.

Q: Was this anti-Jewish, or was this in general Œ A: Anti-Jew Œ not only anti-Jewish, but th Œ anti-partisans, and the Œ she was Œ for us, the partisans had been our friends, you know, in not knowing Œ nobody know about it, but we figure out that just from [indecipherable] you know. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 166 Q: Well here™s the irony too, your father is arrested by the Soviets, but the partisans are Soviets, and now Œ A: No, because Œ you know, because he listen. Q: Yeah. A: In the relations to Nazis, the Soviets had been angels, you know. There™s nothing to compare, you know, with Œ when we didn™t know Germans Œ I mean Nazis, not Germans, then they have been terrible. But as soon as we learned the Nazis, the Soviets have been great. Q: And that™s all part of what the Œ what people in this part of the world Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ went through, you know, that it is Œ A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Œ that it is Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ that it™s complicated.

A: This was the reason that she can read all of the correspondence what comes to him, and that™s how she was able to spy on them, you know, because she have Œ she knows what they asking him, you know. And then how I see Œ I could save people because she told me what™s going on, and I told them. So with Œ this way I Œ I save not only Jewish people, I even couple Poles. Q: So tell me about these things. Tell me about how this Œ how this developed. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 172 A: How Œ Q: She had this job, she had Œ she held it for how long? A: Well, you know, couple years or something. Whatever we had been in Œ Q: It™s a good long time. A: Œ Horodyszcze , yeah. Q: Okay. So Œ A: It wer Œ wasn™t couple years. We had been ™40, ™42, ™43, ™44 Œ something like about three years maybe. Q: That™s a good long time. A: Yes. Q: So all right, so she™s Œ she reads this correspondence. A: Yeah, the correspondence, that™s how she learned many things. Q: So tell me about the first instance when she reads something about what™s going to happen, tell me. A: Well they Œ they told her eexactly ze Œ in the Œ to the Bürgermeister that she Œ they tell him exactly what they are going to do. Q: Okay. A: And that™s what we need to know in underground, you know [indecipherable] to do what to prepare themselves to, you know. So she said, like for example about Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 173 Œ said they™re going perp Œ she Œ they Œ they give the date, exactly date what they come and kill the Jews from the gi Œ left the Jews in the ghetto, for example. They did exactly, the date. Q: Okay. Okay. A: And I say Œ date and hour too probably, yeah. I Œ well, with Germans, they put hour, too. So, knowing this, she told me, and I Œ I Œ I, in a way, was Œ wer Œ have been able to Œ to tell to the Jewish people somehow, you know, not the Œ not to all of them together, but th Œ and one time I was walking on the street and I™ve seen him walking someplace Œ Q: Who? A: The Jews Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ you know, walking someplace, so it was very stupid of me that I did it what I did, because I Œ I went to them and I tell them about this, that so and so date you should run away, because they come to kill you. And then, second time was more clever because they have been Œ not far from my window I™ve seen him Œ seen through my window, they Œ they have been staying next to the water well. And it was a little Œ water well was a little higher than Œ than the rest of the thing, so I Œ I somehow went out to the street and [indecipherable] and I tell them exactly Œ say it Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 174 was two days later, you know. And I tell them exactly, you know, what day exactly should run away. So know what they told me? They told me that everybody it Œ is afraid to run away because there will be not Œ nothing to eat, you know. But you know, this was something that they didn™t trust me, who I am, because they did think about run away, you know. Because 18 of them run away, and I know exactly how many because the police, when Œ the Belorussian police have been the ones that killed them, and they been complaining that 18 didn™t show off, you know, that somebody must tell them Œ tell them, you know. So they did run away, you know, 18 of them. And the Poles, you know, there was something else I say to Poles Œ you know how? Q: Okay, tell me. A: Be-Because the Germans, the Gestapo come to him, and tell hi Œ this was already Gestapo Œ Q: Come to whom? A: To the bear Œ mayor. Q: To the mayor, okay. A: And they told him that the two underground Poles coming from Baranovichi to Horodyszcze , to be confidence with Œ with Poles here. And the mayor of the city see, he wrote these names on this piece of paper. And when they left, he left this Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 175 piece of paper on his desk, you know. So w hen ma Œ my mother was in the other room Œ they didn™t let her having together with this, but she will Œ she had waited til they all left. So they s Œ they said, you can come inside. So she come inside, but she found this piece of paper on the desk, you know, and was two names. Q: Okay. A: So she figure out, there™s two names, must be something very important, and she told me about this. And I ti Œ I Œ I t Œ I went Œ I was running. I went to this [indecipherable] supposed to be Œ they said something about [indecipherable] yes, they supposed to come here, you know. So we let them know, and nobody come, and they Œ therefore they saved two la Œ lives. They will kill them, you know. Q: So Œ but this is also very dangerous Œ A: Yeah, very Œ Q: Œ because the Œ A: Œ of course was danger. Q: Œ because the Œ the thread is very easy to find. A: Look, I mean the Œ you know, you Œ you pro Œ being underground under circumstances, small town? Boy, this is very dangerous. But what can you do, you loo Œ should do something Œ Q: Okay. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 176 A: Œ you know. Q: But were y Œ when you say you were underground, does that mean you were part of a group, or this was just your own initiative Œ A: No, no, they Œ they applied to me.

A: Okay, now, my mother looked for job for me, okay? Q: Okay. A: And the only Œ and then not Œ I don™t know if the only, but the most kind of thing not to be outside, was to work in the woods. Q: Okay. A: And they Œ they said that they need defer Œ des Œ desperately people that can work in the woods and cut trees. Q: Okay, this is the Œ the civil in Œ A: So she said, how about my son? So I went to this job, and then this job actually was big fake because was a little cutting woods, but mostly was underground. And when th-they come to me, Kazik come to me, you know, one of the [indecipherable][speaks Polish] Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 177 Q: What is that? A: You like to be with us.

A: You know, I don™t remember exactly Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ his ec Œ experiences, but it was very bad one for us, you know. Q: Okay. So, here™s another question.

So he wrote this letter to the commandant of battalion told me Œ battalion told her, look, if you™ve got more letters like this, please bring me too, you know. Q: Okay. So, in other words, this was a provocation. A: Pr Œ yeah Œ no Œ was provocation. This is something how they operate, you know? Q: Okay. A: This is typical for Gestapo. They just make fake documents, and kind of see that you an swer something, and they uh-oh [indecipherable] Q: You™re part of it, yeah. A: Can you figure if I ask greetings even, I say Œ I will be killed, and my mother will be killed, and my sister will be killed. Q: And was this a Belarusian, or a rush Œ or a German?

I Œ I never told him who I am, never. Q: Never? A: But when Œ there was times that they arrested Œ starting to arrest Poles, you know, and I didn™t expect they would arrest him because, in my opinion, and I Œ I Œ I know for sure, because when I told him that Œ that maybe I should run away with Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 196 them to woods, so he said it, by all means, don™t do it, you know, he told me don™t. And Œ and if I would do it something Œ so even if I was safe too, they would kill my mother, you know. So I figured out that he™s right, and I d Œ you n Œ I Œ I hated the Germans so much, figure I should run in the woods, you know, etcetera. But then, after he told me this, and I figure too, was that, so I™ve Œ I am not going to run away. But I will stay and do what they ask me.

A: No, you know, because listen, everything is miracles, you know. Everything is so unbelievable, because Œ because I am very not everyday person, honestly. Let me tell you something, look, when the Œ when the Russian Œ Russian offense started from in Œ from direction of course of Minsk, and all of this, direction toward Horodyszcze , and farther, you know. But then we knew this according how™s it Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 204 going, according movement of this German military, because we have seen pushing by through the main highway. We have been next to the highways that going to Baranovichi , you know, so we knew the transport was going somewhere. We look it up and then we see lot of German cars going from di Œ in direction to Baranovichi to Œ to this way, and down. Q: In other words, they™re going from east to west. A: Fr-From Œ yeah, to Œ yeah, to way Œ Q: They™re retreating. A: Retreating. So Œ but we didn™t know how long it will take, but one time they Œ they Œ they stopped it to Œ to walk by foot, you know? So I figure out uh-oh, this mean already is closer, you know. And they Œ they declare Œ same time they declare evacuation of Horodyszcze . This was fantastic because evacuation is mess, nobody knows anything, nobody cared to arrest somebody, you know, the evacuation, it Œ it absolutely fantastic in our case, you know. But how to move, and where? So th ey decide we Œ we Œ they dec Œ dec Œ they decide ts Œ look, our Œ our ho Œ this place that we™re living had not far from police department, you know. I will show you on the map how it is. And they Œ they said Œ I ask one of policemen, where are you going? We going to Warsaw , he said. But this is not Œ this is just Œ it was Œ was not true. Later, I figure out that™s not true because I knew geography, and I know the Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 205 way how we going that it™s not Warsaw , but Königsberg . So you know, but they Œ they lie that they going to Warsaw, you know. Q: Okay. A: Just to fool around. So Œ so Œ so we figure out Warsaw, fantastic, here, let™s go Œ let™s jump Œ jump on one of the cars what everyone™s Œ was empty car, nobody staying next to the car. We come to this cart, and with horse and everything. And they decided to Œ to leave, and they left and we had been living together with them, you know, nobody check Œ Q: And this is German army? A: No, this was not German army, this was police, it was. Q: Oh, it was the police, okay. A: The police. Was not German army, no. Q: Okay. A: There was Œ I don™t know if it™s ge-gendarmerie, maybe. I am not sure about. I think that the Œ Q: The Belarusian gendar Œ the Belarusian police, or the Œ A: The Belarusian. Belarusian police. Q: Okay. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 206 A: So, you know, we went with them. And then, on the way, you know Œ on the way they decided that this cart, they liked to have [indecipherable] cart, so they Œ they gave us another cart, you know. That™s fine, so we got another cart. So we have anything left, because this means that they used to us, you know, that we Œ we are okay, you know what I mean? We Œ they figure out they can question what we™re doing here, you know. Q: Right. A: Œ but several Œ such a mess of disorganization that they didn™t Œ didn™t have a time to Œ to check Œ Q: To think, yeah. A: To see Œ yeah, okay. Well, we didn™t realize that in this cart, under straw, there are guns, ammunition, uniforms and everything, you know? But we didn™t Œ I didn™t check what™s underneath, I figure I just Œ you know. And so we went in one place, you know. Here again, we have to do with priest, how about this? We went to one place that we decided we should run away from them because they are going to Königsberg , and not Warsaw, we better get out from here Œ this place. Q: Okay. A: So I went to this church, and the guy, this priest was ver Œ was very ir Œ understanding, and he said yes, by all means, don™t stay with them. So, I mean, but Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 207 where we going? So he got Œ he Œ he told me exactly where to go and where I should s Œ make a left turn, you know, th Œ I have it here, this what he told me. Q: Okay. A: Go to [indecipherable] I gave you letter to the soltys . Soltys is the head of the village. Q: Okay. A: I Œ I will give him letter that you say should accomm odate you, you know. Q: Okay. A: So this is something we should do. That was easy to say, but difficult to do it, because they watching us. They started to watch us somehow, and they put horsemen on both sides of our car. Q: Well, you have the guns. A: Ye-Yeah, but Œ but we Œ I didn™t know I have the guns, you see Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ I didn™t know. But then, you know, so after sometimes, you know, the guy on the left side start to be tired or something, and he disappeared from this, I don™t know what happened. And the other guy, just before we Œ we cut Œ we come to the ci Œ to the town that we should go, he still was there, but he has close eyes, and he was sleeping with the horse, you know. But Œ but Œ but you know Œ but we went a Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 208 little farther, and I figure out he sleep very well, and le Œ we can come back, you know, we can turn back and turn this place that he [indecipherable] . And then was Œ then th Œ the problem was, it was German camp next to this, and I figure out they will see that somebody™s running from this thing, they can run after us, you know. But this horse, just like we understand something, he start to run like crazy, you know, and I didn™t say anything. And we just went up so fast, you know, that they f Œ I figure out even if they will see that we™re something, will Œ it will be too late for them to catch up with us, you know. Q: Okay. A: So they Œ eventually we found the soltys , the guy who was in charge, and he accommodate us. So this was one part. Q: So now you have a horse and a cart and weapons and guns and everything. A: Yeah, yeah, b ut the hor Œ the horse we gave better to these guys that accommodate us, because we didn™t Œ what are we going to do with this horse, you know. Q: Okay. A: But how do I know about the guns? Because Œ because we left this cart, you know, after the Œ they Œ they took this horse, they too Œ they left the cart, and we went to these woods, you know. They were big woods, you know. So we figure out Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 209 this is safer to be in the woods with other people. And he told us that Ukrainian partisans had been there, and they found guns, ammunition. But they left uniforms. So we took the uniform. Later, we sold them. What kind of guns, they took guns and ammunition, but uniforms they sold it, you know? So the Œ okay, there was a Œ you like to farther? Everything is there. Q: Well, what I want to know is Œ is did you Œ did the cer Œ [break - technical interruption] Okay, so when we stopped before, we were Œ before this break, we were talking about how you and your mother turned off to a little side street with a cart that had guns, and se Œ A: Oh yeah. Q: Œ and Œ and uniforms, and that you sold the uniforms. A: Yes, yes. Q: And was this Œ did this mean that the Soviet army was not far behind, because you were evacuating? A: Absolutely you™re right. Q: Okay. So what happened then? Where Œ where did you Œ A: Okay. Q: You Œ there you were, no horse, you™re someplace Œ A: Yeah. Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 210 Q: Œ you know, you have the sol Œ the Œ the uniforms that you sell. What happens? A: Okay, first, you know, when we come to this place, we have seen Œ there were no Soviets, but there have been Germans Œ German officer, and three guns, something li ke this Œ couple guns, you know. And they been shooting in direction to Russian. And each time they shoot, it was so noisy, you know, was just terrible. But the problem was not what they shoot, but they shoot against them, because we have been there. So this Œ after some times, we didn™t wait too long, they started to shoot in the Œ in our direction to hit this Œ Q: Germans. A: Œ Germans, you know. So can you figure what it was, it was big, heavy artillery, was not just small artil Œ and we Œ so there was one place I don™t remember, we dig ourselves, so it was already dark, and we have been in some kind of hou Œ place in the Œ in the ground, you know, to be safer, you know. But, of course if this will hit us, it will be terrible, but it didn™t, but was hitting all around us, you know. But one of them hit very close to us, I remember very much, and we had been shocked, you know. But this was Œ after Œ after this, we had enough of this area. We had come to the woods Œ inside the woods, you know, because in big part of the woods, you know, and they Œ not only us, there had been other people that run away fro m the villages too, because there have been bombs and [indecipherable] . Now, what Œ Interview with George Dynin October 21, 2015 211 what was a Œ the very unusual things happen again, you know, that first, you know, in this woods here was very nice, but was nothing to eat, of course, you know.
