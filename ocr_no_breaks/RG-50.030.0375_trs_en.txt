A: There was no other wa y in Poland than being religious, but I wouldn't call it specially because being brought up without a father, so were not that strict like in some of my friends' homes.

Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about your life before th e war that would give me special insight into what it was like living there? Wh at good memories do you have? A: Oh, I had 12 girlfriends and then when we get a little older, there were a lot of boyfriends. And it was kind of, I was born in a house that was a open house, everybod y was coming in to our house. They chose to. And young people an d they used to come from small towns, Satu rday night, to us. And having parties and dances and mu sic. It was, there was a very, we used to sit up Friday night 4 until two o'clock at night and every time in another house. And then all the girls and the boys used to come and find some snacks in the house. And having a good time, but this was mainly Friday and Saturdays, because this is the days there was no school. Or this is the days they didn't work, people did not work. Because everything was cl osed on Saturday. But it was a, we had happy times. We did. We enjoyed the small towns. It was kind of together, everything was together. If anybody had a problem, if anybo dy had a death, the whole town __ _________. It was, everybody knew everybody, everybody kn ew what they have, what's going on, what the news of the town. It was a very nice town. We had three temples. We had, the Hebr ew school was excellent. And then, of course, when we changed to private school, it was also very good. It was a normal life. A normal, nice life. We knew each other. It was friendly. It wa s welcome. We never had a door locked. The doors were always open and unlocked. A nd we had a lot of friends among the nonJews. That they were always welcome in the house. And coming in. Q: Were there political asso ciations? Were you invol ved in any youth groups? A: Yes. Yes. We belonged to the Bittah(ph). Which is now the ri ght wing. And we used to go out, outings and every, every so often me etings. I, there was a library. I was working in the library. When it was open to public, two days a week. But, there was always people, it was all kind of organizations. We had th e Bittah, we had the Ashomerits(ph) ______, we had the Zionist, other organizations. People were coming for meetings. We had always speakers coming from other towns together. And it was always meetings and there was almost , if we would have, we didn't have more time because in the time that we were in school, there was not time. And later on, we were going from, we used to go this town there is somethin g going on. A kid knows this town there is something. People used to come to our town, alwa ys we go to other towns. And it was, we knew the surrounding, around small towns always, too. It was a very friendly way of living. Q: Were you aware, before the Germans came in, of what was go ing on in Germany and, did you know about Hitler, did you know about any of this? A: Yes, we knew because we always had a newspape r in the house from Warsaw. We didn't have a newspaper printed in our town, but we used to have the newspaper from Warsaw. It was a Jewish 5 newspaper. We knew, but we wo uld, we would never believe that can something happen. There can be a change in our life. We would never beli eve it. I, even the day when it happened, we did not believe what had happened to us. There was, it' s a very, I would say like this, when you live in a home that you got everything, noth ing is missing except, I said, we missed our father very much in life. That nobody can chase us out of the ho use. Nobody can take away fr om us anything. It's ours. It belongs to us. And we have such good neighbors and we have su ch good people around us. All our workers in the tannery, they were so devoted to us. And even, we ha d a maid, she was 16 years with us. She raised us, she spoke Yiddish just like we did. An d we were so, we were so well known in town. That we couldn't understand that something c ould happen to us. And the day that the war broke out, we were having a good time in our garden. We were all sitting, boys and girls, we were having a good time. And all of a sudden th ey come and they say the war, a war broke out. We couldn't believe it. We ran home to the houses an d we couldn't understand what happened here. Q: When you say the war broke out, are you talking about... A: 1939. September, 1939. We coul dn't believe it. We weren't ready for it. We weren't, we didn't know there is, we didn't know what a war means even. Q: So, maybe you can tell me what happened. What you did at that point. A: Well, everybody went to their house and I came and everybody was afraid . They were afraid, for example, we won't have any news what's goi ng on because they were co nfiscating the radios. And I went into the Commandant from the town, wh ich was a neighbor and he was, we were very friendly with him. And I asked him, please see they should not take away our radio. This is a coincidence, I can never forget it, and he said, oka y, I'll let you have it. And my brother was crying, they wanted to take away his motorcycle. He was the only one in town he had a motorcycle. And they wanted to confiscate it, his mo torcycle, to mobilize. And he sai d, let him hide, I'll stay behind. It was a lot of things th at happened, but we had the privileges to benefit from people that we knew that they will help us. And that 's when, but, it didn't take too lo ng when the Russians marched in. Then we started to feel problems. Because we knew that we will be the ones who will suffer more than anybody else. The day of Fo rshoshona(ph), we were all in the temple, did not know what's 6 going on. And we came out from the temple, we see tanks are coming in, armies coming in and they are Russians. So, of course, then we started to feel war, we were confused, we didn't what is going, what will be with us. And we had a lot of certain expe rience without, without protection. Because they did send out the police and the Commandant and ev erything, they send them to Siberia. And we had nobody, no protection over us, to watch us . So, there was a lot of certain bad experiences. But we did overcom e that until it became worse. Q: Well, you were under the Russians for two years almost. A: No. Q: No? A: It became, they gave it to Lithuania. We became Lithuanian s, we not no more Poles. The Lithuanians took it over. And they forced us to go to learn, if anybody di d not speak Lithuanian, if you got any problems, they really used to beat us up. And we st arted to study, but the language, before Lithuanian, we started to study Russian. A nd then in no time, we became Lithuanian, so we had to learn Lithuanian. The Lithuanian language and there was, a very, very hard language to learn. So, there was a very, very hard, but there was freedom. We still, people used to travel overseas. People could, I could, we could travel. We were goi ng to Vilna, we were going to Kovna(ph), Kovna was before we coul dn't go. We could travel all over. And then it started a lot of coming from other towns because th ey that from Lithuania you can leave the country for travel, for going farther if you wanted to go to the United St ates or something. It wasn't easy, but you could make it yet. Which, where the Germans were occu pational, where the Russians were occupied, you could not travel. Q: So, the Russians we ren't in control? A: A very short time, a very short time. Q: So, how did this affect your life? Your family was fairly affluent and under the Lithuanians and the Russians, did they allo w all of this privilege? A: No. My, the whole family, fr om the time that the Russians were, my family did not sleep at home. I was the only one, we were raising a little boy from our cousin from Vilna, he had to study 7 to be Bar Mitzvah. So we brought him to our hou se, it was a open house. Always family, always people. And we were teaching him the Bar Mitvah, to be. So, I'm the only one with him, I slept, we slept in the house. Because the police department was very close to our home. And I used to stay up until 2:00 and if I didn't see a stationwagon near the police, it means they are not going to come for us. Then I used to go to sleep. But I used to cry a lot and the little boy used to always come to me and comfort me. Mira, why are you crying? Why are you crying ? I said, it's okay, I want to cry because mother is not home. Or my mother will come, I won't cry any more. So, they used to sleep always in different places. My tw o brothers and my mother, and I us ed to stay home and watch the house. And that time, that was a bi g tragedy. We didn't know that can come worse. And, that was very hard. We knew that any day we'll be sent to Siberia. We knew it. An d it wouldn't take long, if they would stay longer. Q: So, they took away yo ur business, the tannery? A: The tannery, yes. They nationa lized the tannery. They, everything was sold out quickly. They, when the Russians marched in, the next day, when we got up, we saw a line that we thought they will push away our house. They were all lined up to get in to buy the merchandise. The leather. And we were used that everybody comes in to buy what they need. There was nothing. You can't even, they would like to buy, they didn 't have it. So, they told us there is things, they want as much as they could take. Take it. So, it didn't take too long to sell out everything, in a couple of days, it was all empty. Q: Now, who bought this? The Russians? A: The Russians. Until, this was when, until, then after, Lithuania was no problem. Business was going on as normal. Q: So, how soon did the Ru ssians actually move in? Do you remember the date? A: It was in September, I don't remember the date exactly. But I know that as we came out from the temple, and we saw the Russians marc hing in and we didn't understa nd why. What are they doing? There was going to be a war with the Germans. How come the Ru ssians are marching in? Because 8 they took it over before, in Warsaw the war was s till going on. The Poles were still fighting with the Germans. Q: So, this was 1940, the fall of 1940? A: Yeah. This is still in 1939. Q: The Russians came in in 1939? A: Yes. They marched into our place, to our, right away. Q: So, you weren't under th e Lithuanians very long. A: Yes, we were. We were from '40 un til '41. Until '41 we were Lithuania. Q: Okay. So, you're considerin g the Lithuanians and the Russians the same? This is where I'm getting confused. A: Yes. Q: When you say you were under the Lithuanians and that wasn't bad, and then the Russians came in. A: No, no. The Russians came before Lithuania. The Russian s marched in when the war on Poland was still fighting. Th ere was, the war started in September, and it was before the holidays, our holidays, and then in, I don't know exactly the time, but in a few weeks they were there. In a week or two weeks, the Russians marched i n. And then they gave it to Lithuania. After they moved, they did not move out, but they were going farther to Li thuania and they actually, the ones that remained is the Lithuanians. Only L ithuanians, no more Russians. Q: But was Lithuania... A: Under the Russ ian occupation. Q: Now, when your town was un der the control of the Russians and the Lithuanians, could you continue practicing your religion? Was that a problem? A: No problem. We could pr actice religion, we were, we coul d, the temples were open. The schools were open. It was a norm al life. We could travel. Ther e was, the only, maybe the poor people could feel it more becaus e there was a scarce in food product. There was a problem with 9 exchanging food. If y ou had something worth to exchange, you got the food, whatever you wanted. Because the farmers used to come to town and br ing food. But you had to give them something, they did not want to take mone y. They wanted exchange. An d the problem was for the poor people. So this is what for so me other ones, it was a lot of probl ems. I remember we had a cow always in the house. Now, when we milk the cow, we always used to take it to take to everybody of the neighbors, annoying some people that they need it, to give it away. To he lp them because they could not buy it. This was for some people a little, they felt that people, the poor people felt it more than did people that were well off. Q: But on the other hand, your moth er and your brothers had to hide. A: Not for the Lithuanians. For th e time of the Russians, but they weren't too long with us. It was long enough because we knew we ar e afraid, it was long enough. But, not, they weren't too long. The Lithuanians took it all. Q: So, do you remember how long the Russians were, their presen ce was there? Was it a few months, a few weeks? A: No, a few months. A few months. Q: And then after they left, your mother could come home? A: We were home all day, just at night we didn't sleep, because mo st of the taking ou t of people sent to Siberia, was at night. In the middle of the night. Bu t during the day, we were always watching ourselves. Always looking in the back, but not, it was normal. The only problem was because we knew that at night, someday we will have to disappear. Q: Do you remember wh at you talked about? A: We tried not to talk to o much, because we couldn't trust, it's a very funny situation, you could not trust your neighbor. You could not trust anybody. Because ther e were meetings constantly, for example, in the, in town. In the Piatza(ph). And when they used to come to talk, if we didn't go out to listen, they used to say, oh, it's too good for them . They don't even come to see it. To listen. And if we went, we always had so mebody in the back watching us. If we clap our hands proper. If 10 we are happy. And if we were ha ppy, they used to say, they are still happy. It's, they're still better off, they're still happ y. Whatever we did was wrong, we couldn't know which direction. And... End of tape 1. 11 Tape 2. Q: When you said, it'll be a minute before we start, but, when you're talking... I'm rolling. Q: You're rolling? Okay. You were saying that you would go out in the square and people were watching you. This was the Lithuanians? A: The Russians. The time of the Russians. For the time of th e Lithuanian, I'll tell you an incident for example. The border between White Russia and Lithuania was only three kilometers from our town. My brother, the youngest br other, loved animals. So, he as ked to one Pole if he can bring him a nice horse. And since our tannery was right on the border, it was easy to sneak it in. And he brought him a horse. And he went to pick up the horse and bring it to the barn near the house. I almost, I forgot it, I just, recently when I was in Brazil where my brothers lived, my brother did remind me, do you remember how you saved my life? And I said what did I do? He said, don't you remember when I was bringing the horse home a nd a Lithuanian policeman came up to him and said he wants, where did you get the horse? Did you bring it from over the border? And he said, no, I bought it from the tannery and I'm bringing it to the house. Which was true, he picked it up from the tannery. But, he said, no, it's a too beautiful horse. You got it from over, and he wanted to take it away. And I didn't know what's going on, I was standing in the house in the window and all of a sudden I see he's standing, my brother stays with the horse and he's arguing with the policeman. And the policeman was grabbing his gun to him. So, I ran out and I jumped on the policeman and I grabbed, I almost grabbed the gun out of him and pushed him away from my brother. And then I started, give him the horse, let him take the horse, we get into the house. Th ere were certain things, some are forgotten and some things come, some remind you of whatever was during the war, certain incidents. But we were a normal life, we used to go for an evening school, in evening schools we were going, studying the languages. Until, of course, the Germans came in. Q: Did you have the business duri ng the Lithuanian occupation? 12 A: The tannery was nationalized. So, we didn't have it. But, we did have, we still were going on with some business. Hidden, ther e was hidden business, it was not, because my brother used to go to Vilna and bring certain merchandise that we used to sell, but maybe, maybe it would normalize and we would maybe get into business again. But the business was kind of not normal. Q: But everything else went on? A: Yeah, it could have, eventually we would have a normal life w ith the Lithuanians. And we would maybe be better off if we would understand ea ch other more. Q: What about anti-Semitism during the Lithuanian period. A: There was. We always felt it. We always did. But, we always, we used to translate it maybe because they don't understand us. But, the Lit huanians always they had a record of being antiSemitists. Q: How would that manifest itself? A: We always had to watch, to know that we are Jews. We always had to know about it. That we are not, we are second-hand citizens. We're told the privileges th at we had. We ar e not, we weren't too much at home. Q: Was that troublesome? A: I, yes, because, but we did not feel it as bad because a lot of refugees were coming in, every night, every night, they used to come in and stop in our house. They were running away from the occupation of where the Germans occupied already. An d they used to tell stories that, what we felt was nothing. We still were in our homes, we had our belongings, we were, we lived a normal life and we happy we could help them. There wasn't a night that people shou ld not come in from the borders. So, our trouble wasn't as ba d as the other ones, what we felt. Q: Tell me about how all of this changed. A: When? Q: Well, you've been saying that this wasn't so bad un til the Germans... A: Until the Germans came in. Be cause the Germans, in 1941, that was in June, and we saw all of a sudden, a big movement in our town because our town was the main road from Vilna Lider(ph), 13 from Lithuania to _____ _________. And all of a sudden we see a lot of movement, that a lot of trucks are running through our town and we did not know what is going on. And we, of course, any truck that stopped, we went to ask them what is going on. And they say, you don't know? The Germans declared war. And they are, they were running back to Russia, because Lithuania was full of Russian people. They were under their comma nd. And so we knew that , we actually found out that there is going to be a war again. There was news that the Russians, that the Lithuanians are killing the Russians. They are throwing them into the ocean. Because they actually want friends, they didn't like them. It was just superficial that they lived in harm ony. They were, they wanted to get rid of them. And they, and th e war, early in the morning we heard the Germans marching in. Because, and I remember I had a cous in that was in the Polish Army and we didn' t sleep that night. We were standing and talking, what will it be, what will he do? What is going on? We did not know what to expect. And we heard, I heard, like somebody would play with rocks, the noise like you throw rocks, so I says, but what is this noise? Do yo u hear? What is it? They said, they are throwing parachutes. And he said, you'll see. Because he knew, he was in the army, he understood better than we did. They are parachuting some people here. And in no time they will march in. And it didn't take too long, and in the morning, th e Germans started to marc h in. So, we left the house and we went to some of our workers. We stayed there all day. And then we decided we have to go to our house. To see what, what will it be with us? Of course, in those times there was no, no camps, no death camps, nothing. They just, well, people lived under the German occupations. It was scary. There was a lot of things going on. But, we did not expect what we had later on. And, but we came home and we lived for awhile. On the second day, for example, I was standing in the window and a couple of Germans walked up to us and one German looks up and I had a watch in my hand. And he said, gi ve me the watch. I'm in my house, why should I give him the watch? I couldn't understand it. So, I said, no. And my brother h eard it and came, he said, take off the watch and give it to him in a hurry. Do n't you know what this is? He ta kes a Jew in a minute. You'll be dead. Give him the watch. So, of course, I took off the watch and I give it to him. But I still thought, yeah, we are somebody in our homes, I don 't have to give it to him. And then it didn't 14 matter, they could take whatever they wanted. Bu t, we were in one way lu cky. Because our house was in the middle of the town and it was very big. It was a two story and as they were coming in more and more, they occupied fo r the main stop, for the main of fice, so the Germans, the very important Germans used to stay in our house. A nd right away they put up a note, that nobody is allowed to come in there. So, we actually did not suffer too much. In a way, they used to take out some people. For example, if a man with a beard, they used to follow him if he went to the temple, and then cut his beard off or beat him up or something. We did not feel it in our house because nobody was allowed, the access wasn't allowed to come into our house. Q: So, it was the German army that was sharin g part of your house? A: Yes. The army, the main, from the main line s of their, until the year , they stayed until they almost marched into Leningrad. Our house was occupied. And, as a matter of fact, there were certain things I had to make for them, like cut up vegetables and this. But, we felt kind of, we didn't feel what some other pe ople, get the problems. Q: Now, when you went out of the house, was there a big German presence on the streets? A: Not big, not big. But there were always Germans, yes. An d, at that time, was formed the _____________. And people had to go to work. There was not specially, but they had, they had to give somebody something to do. Q: You? A: I didn't, I did not have to go, but I volunteered to go. I did. I didn't want to be any different. Q: What did you do? A: Cleaned the street, pull out grass. Go, there was _____________, but they had to employ people. Just to sit in the sun and burn yourself. Q: Was there any brutality? A: There was in town. There wa s. We did not, we did not get to it, but there was brutality. Q: Did you see it? A: No, I didn't. Q: Did they close the synagogues? 15 A: As far as I remember, they were not closed. But, I know there was inci dents where they took out and I think this is because there was, if anybody fr om the Poles that had, was mad at you, they used to get together to transfer to th e Germans, and they used to come to this and this house, where was mad somebody, and take them out, for example, to the cemetery and shoot over his head. Just, just to, they did not kill anybody, but to torture them. To put a fear in them. This I know. I heard it. We used to hear a lot about it. Is they cut the beard off this, they did th is, just torturing certain people. But, there was no, were no casualties in those times, until the day came. Q: Were there special rule s that were put in place? A: Oh, yes. We had to put on the yellow _________ on our arms. We could not walk on the sidewalk. And as this progressed further, the Poles were not allowed to come to sell us anything. We couldn't, we were not allowed, they weren't allowed to bring to sell something to Jews. We, especially, did not feel it as much because we had so many frien ds around the Poles, that even if they had to risk their life, they used to bring us anyway. The war would go on and out of 20 years, we would have plenty of food in our house. Q: So your Polish friend s didn't turn on you? A: No. No. Until the last, even the last days, bu t our neighbor, when my mo ther wanted to hide one night at our neighbors, and we we re such devoted, close friends, sh e did not let even my mother to sleep overnight. She said she can't let her in. Sh e said she can't let her in. But our workers were very devoted until the last day. That's very unusual, very unusual. Q: So, when you sa y the last day, what does that mean? What happened? A: That was the day th ere was _________ _________. In the morni ng for, before our High Holidays. This was in 1941. I and one of our nei ghbors, we said, we have to clean, they were very much concentrated on clean ______________ in town . And we had a big yard in front, so we got up in the morning and I said to th is young girl, you'll help me and we 'll clean the good in front very thoroughly, so tomorrow, we won't have to work. Because there was, it would have been a big tragedy on _________ ________ to do something. We weren't used to. Ev erything was closed and everybody were in the te mples. And as we were doing it, one of our relatives came running to the 16 house and she started to cry, oh, my God, oh, what will we do, what will, I says, what happened, what happened? She said, didn't you see all the notices that are put on th e walls who has money, who has gold, who has silver, who ha s materials, who has leather, wh atever it is, they should bring it in to the police. And this is a sign they are going to do something to us. They'll make it like nobody told about killing. They make a ghetto. And it started a big commotion in town, everybody was running to the police bringing in some whatever they want. Whatever they could hide, they were. They were alread y hidden. We already gave it away to some among our Po lish friends to hide a lot of things. But, whatever we had, we were going and bringing it in to the police. And, this was going on all morning, and then a lot of people started to leave town. And then we heard that two sisters got killed. They were trying to leave the town. And they caught them and they killed, and this stopped a lot of people. But, we still did not, my mother still ordered my two brothers and we had two refugees, young men, that they ran away from the occupation of the Germans where they occupied before us. And they got dressed a lot of clothes, and she told them where to go, to one of a shoemaker that he used to be a friend of ours. And it wa s only about a kilo meter and a half from town. They should go ther e and stay there until we see what will come out. We still didn't know what is going to happen to us . And as they, and were sure th at they left already. They got dressed and left. And my sister, we brought my sist er from, my sister was ma rried in White Russia. We brought her from there with the two children because her husband was taken away right the first week when the Germans came in. They occupied their town an d they took away, the took the doctors and the lawyers and the t eachers. He was a teacher. And they took him right away, they killed him, but we did not know that. All the time the told, the explanation was they took him for work someplace. And every day we used to send somebody to, they used to say they're working near Warsaw, so we send somebody near Warsaw. They weren't there. They said, oh, they left yesterday. They transferred them to another place, they transferred them ther e. We couldn't find him anywhere, until we, it took a long time until we realized that they killed him. And so my sister, there was no exchange, they didn't have what to ex change, so she, we brou ght her to our house and she lived with us. And my sister, we arranged, my mother arrang ed that my sister and the children 17 should go to one of our workers to stay there. And I and mother did remain in the house. And I was running from one house to another house wher e there were fathers to see what are they doing. Maybe they know better than we what we know. An d they kept saying, one said, where can I run? I have to go to more ask for a pi ece of bread. So, how can I run? And others sa ys, how can we run? Look at my old mother, she can't wor k, she's in bed most of the time. I went into another girlfriend, I said, Myrtle, what are you doing? How can I run? My daughter is pregnant. The brought her from Lider(ph), from the bigger towns, they pulled out people and broug ht to the small towns because they're still, and those were, I'm talking all about the wealthier people. Wher e can I run? Look at her, she is to have a baby any day. Where can I run? I'm not running. I'll stay. And I was running around like this all day, not knowing what, what w ill it come out. And then I came, I got tired, and I came, it was getting a little dark. I came into the house and my mother was going to light the candles. And I look out through the window and I see civilian people who _______________ on their shoulders. So, I got very frightened. I thought, gee, that's not, that's not normal. They are not Germans, they are civilians. So, I kept yelling, I yelled out to my mother, you _____________, let's run. But we weren't ready, wher e to run also. So, we ran, we thought we will go to one of our workers, to get un ited with my sister an d the children. But, by coincidence, in the morning, we had a lot of money in the house. And we decided to go hide it where the tannery is. Because the tannery is in the back of the town. If we need money, we can sooner dig it out. Like in town, everybody is watching over you. As I and my brother were going to take the, with a whole basket of money that we carried, we put a stick in and he carried from one side, I from the other side. One of the Pole, a Pole th at was coming from ch urch, this was on Sunda y, and he gets, comes closer to us and says, ___________ ______, I feel so bad, I hear that it's a bad time coming on us, on you. And if you want, come, run to me. To my farm. But we never knew where a farm is out of town, we never went out of town. We never went anywhere, we didn't know where to go. So, that was in the afternoon, and then at night, we decided, and I said to my mother, let's run. I knew where we have to run to. To be united with my sister because my brothe rs we knew are hidden there. I, we couldn't run through the front door, we went to the back door . And I did not look around, I just 18 opened the barn door, and I ran, it was not too fa r because it was a smal l town, anyplace was not that far. My mother looked around and she foun d my brothers, sitting in the barn. And she says, what are you doing here? They say they couldn't leave town because there was, there were rumors that they are shooting. So, we returned back home. So she said to them, what is my life? My life doesn't mean anything. If you don't save yourself, what does it mean to me? So, she said, go to the garden, we had a big garden in the, right after the houses. And she said to them, go in the garden. Lay down under the leaves from the cucumbers because they are very big now. And, see, at night if you can get out. And she did, in the meantime, she didn't, I left. And when I was running, one of the Poles there, said to me, Mirchka(ph), where are you running? You'll get shot, d on't run. I'll tell you, I'll get into, where do you want to go? I was not smart enough, and I told them where I'm running. I wasn't supposed to sa y where I'm running. But, I told them, I'm going to the Vladik's(ph) house. And he said, well, I'll get into the house, I'll open up the window in my house, and you jump through the window and then cross the street and get in. So, he did, he went into the house and opened up the window and I went through the window, I jumped over and I crossed the street and I was reunited with my sister. And there were three, four, four families more, Jewish families that night. And, of course, I was with three childre n, my sister and we had the boy, the cousin from Vilna, and there was a big commotion. This one to eat and this one to drink and all night we were very busy. And then in the morning, his wife cam e out and says that you will all have to leave because I don't want to get killed because of you. Q: Okay. Let's ch ange the tape. We'll pick up... End of tape 2. 19 Tape 3 A: So, I said to her, don't worry, we won't stay here. I will try, I'll take one child and I'll try to move to the factory. To the tannery, because it's very close there. It was close to the tannery, he was working for us, all my live I knew him. And his brothers were work ing for us, too. And, if they'll catch me there, all they can do is kill me. But I am in my own place so we will not cause trouble to you. And I got into there, to the house, and I was still thinking about the Pole who gave us the idea to run to his house. And I also knew from anothe r Pole that came about five days before to our house, and he looked up and we were boarding the sister and the child ren, and he warned us, he said to my mother, why did y ou bring your daughter and children he re? The Lithuanians wants a clean Lithuania with no Jews. And in White Russia, the Jews, I don't know how long, but the Jews who still live in Lithuania, they are going to kill all the Jews. And we knew that he is from the more intelligent Poles, not just the farmer, it was a very rich farmer. But he had children, they were very high rank in the Polish army, all officers. We knew that he knows some thing, but the way he expressed it, so, we did not want to accept it. So, after he left us, my mother said, _________________, he came to our house and eats our supper, _______ __________. We couldn't believe it, we didn't want to believe it. Who is going to chase us out of the house? It's ours. It went from generation to generation. And he was, he gave us also the idea, the only ones that will survive is people that they will hide. And my oldest brother, later on, went and he stayed with him for awhile. But, it was very hard to hide because th ey all had people working for them, and they knew they will talk to those, they are keeping Jews. But, as I was in the tannery all the day, then I told my sister, if I pass through right, sh e should come. But we did not kn ow where my mother is. My mother wasn't with us. We knew that my brothers, I didn't know that they are in town. We were sure that they are protected. Because the first thing for the protection wa s the men. What we looked. And as I, and I said to the janitor, where is Marisha(ph)? Marisha was married to him, she was a maid for us. And I wanted to go to town and find out where my mother is. We didn't know what, we didn't know what is go ing on. That night, they get out everybody to the temple, all the Jews. But, we did not know what is going on. So I said, Lede r(ph), go and find out where my 20 mother is. I thought maybe she went back to the house. And he said, she is not home and I don't want you here. So I t hought, well, we started to feel more and more that we are not wanted anyplace. We have no place, we have no way, we don't know what to do. So, I said, no, I will not be here too long. And there wa s a slaughterhouse right near our tannery. I saw a young man coming out, so there was a hope chest standing in this little house. And there was even some of our things. I took out a piece of material for a suit and I called him, I don't re member his name. And I said, if you tell me where Kokochan(ph) is, a village, where the Pole told us that if we want, we should run to him, I will give you this piece of material. He said, I don't want to be killed. Because if I'll go with you, I'll get killed. I said, no you won't. You go from one side and I go from another side, far away from each other. And, if they catch me , obviously, they will kill me, but I will never say that you are going with me. I will never, I promise you, I will not gi ve you out. And he did, and he showed me where Kokochan is. I couldn't get into his, in to this man's house right away because there were, I saw, there is people are driv ing around with motorcycle s. And, obviously, I didn't think there is only, there must be Germans, and I cannot ______________, I was hiding in a little forest. And then, and they left, I went there. But I asked him to go a nd bring my sister with the other two children, and she'll gi ve you more things. She'll pay go od off. And he did, and he brought my sister and the children there. But, there was, at the time of the Russians, this Pole himself, was hiding, because he was a rich farmer. So, he wa s afraid that they will send him out to Siberia, too. So, he had workers, and the workers did not want us. They want us out and out and out. So, we told them that we will not stay. We only want to know where my mother is. So, and the owner, the farmer, was not in. He went to _________ _______ to see what's going on with the Jews. What kind of commotion is going on. So, I said, the minut e you will find out where my mother is, we are going to be gone from your house. We will not stay here. Not knowing where will we go, what will we do, where is anybody? I, anyway, they kept, we want you out, we want you out. So, when he came, he ga ve us a horse and buggy, next da y. And we were going to move to a village that we knew where the Tartars are. And they are Muslims. There was only one small village, but they used to buy leather from us. So, we thought we will go there meantime, if they will 21 accept us, we don't know. But at le ast it's close to White Russia, sma ll town Raddan(ph). If not, we will have to go to Raddan. And we came there, I did remain to see what, you'll go to town and you'll find out where my mother is. He did go and he came with the news that my mother went with all the Jews to the temple. They are all locked up. And he said, so my place was, I felt I have to go to see what is with my sister an d the children. We went there, but he was, he brought us every day information. Where my moth er is, where my, he found out that my brothers did not leave the town. They are hiding in a shoemaker's ho use in town. Not too, right arou nd the corner where we lived. And they are there, they're hidden in the barn. If they will be able to get out, we don't know. He said, but if they will be able, they will leave. Tonight or tomorrow night. I was, went, I was with my sister there, we had what to eat . Obviously, they gave us what to eat. And, but, we don't, we did not know what we should do. We were absolutely, we didn't know where should we turn, where should we go. And, then he told us, we didn 't know what was going on, but we heard that on Wednesday, they took out all the Jews from the temples there a nd they brought them out a big market which used to be the, the farmers used to bring in their cattle and their food to sell, there was one, like a farmer's market they ca lled it. Once a week they used to come ther e with everything to sell to town. And my mother is ther e, too. We told the people. We did not know what the fate will, what will be with us, we didn't know what will be with her. My brothers did not come out yet. But, next night they did come in, they came in. They came in, but of course, we knew we cannot be there. So, we moved to another place, another, it wa s a mother to this worker of ours. She took us in for awhile. And, knowing that is the hardest part, with children, we have three small children. We have a 13 year old, we have a two and a half and a year. So , we decided, since we have the horse and buggy that they gave to us, we'll send them to my mother's family. My mother came from a small town, Liptenshoc(ph). We'll send them there and ther e was no ghettos yet. And we'll see if they will meantime be th ere until we will know what, until we reunite together. Until we will see, maybe we will all go to live in White Russia. With my mother's family. Be cause my mother had two sisters and she had two, th ree brothers. They were all in small towns there. And in the meantime, we will be around with them together. But, it took quite awhile until we got all together. 22 So, we came and we went to Radden . It was 14 kilometers from our town. And in no time, they made a ghetto. Q: Let me ask you a question here. Did you find out what happened to the people who were in the marketplace at that time? A: Yes, yes. My mother came, she knew everyt hing. They brought them out, they get out Sunday night. They brought, near us wa s a small town where a mental institution for mental people, they put them out in a row, but entering the temple, like in the hall. And every, a nd then they announced that everybody should come to the temple. They can bring in what they carry on their shoulders. They gave them sticks and they told everybody to hit over their heads. So, they were beating up everybody. The name of this town was Shiloch(ph), a small little town. And then, of course, the brought from another, from Walkinik(ph) was a sm all town. They brough t Jews from Walkinik, also, to the temple. And it was very crowded and there were peop le sick, people having children. No facilities to go out. But I heard that one of my girlfriends and the Commandant, the Lithuanian Commandant came to the temple, she went out, because we knew him, and she said to him, give us a way of, live with dignity. Not, there was no bathrooms, there was nothing. She says, or kill us. Pick what you want. Or k ill us or give us a way to live like humans. And he said, we'll see, we'll see. That was Sunday night, Mo nday, Tuesday, Wednesday. They brought all of the Jews, all of them out from the te mple in the market. The ma rket was closed gates. And they told everybody to sit down, nobody can stand up. Now, one man, he was asthmatic and he could not breath. So he stood up. And they sh ot him. So this was the first casualty in this parking place. And then, in no time, mother was there. Now, we weren't there, bu t every day that Polish man used to bring us all the news. They started to gather, they went through and they picked al l the young men and the strong men, young and stro ng. And they told them they're taking, their wives, they're taking them for work. There was a big farm near Ashashoc(ph), where the owne r wasn't there already because they sent him to Siberia. But of course, the gr ound, the people tried to keep it up. And they took them there to work and they forced them to write letters to their wives, they are okay and they are alive and they are working. But, the name was Sacluski(ph), they we re working on Sacluski's farm. 23 That wasn't true. Becaus e the minute they got them out, they had dug all of the ditches. Near the cemetery. And they took them and they shot th em there. They bro ught us information, for example, that one of my cousins, got out from the grave and he said, if you want, I'll give you the hair off my head, but shoot us right. Because about, they were all, they made them undr ess and they were shooting them and they were falling into the graves. Bu t some weren't shot. They covered them when they were still alive. So, he said, shoot us right. But we still didn't believe it. And one of our worker's wives came to my mother, to bring her food, and tell her, we want to save you. Once you are out of here, come, we will save you. They used to bring food and give it to the people that were watching around there. And they wanted to save her. And my mother says, she is not going out. She is afraid. Until on the second day, one came and she actua lly beat up my mother, and she kicked her out with her feet. She put a bi g shawl on her and she kicked her so bad that she brought her up to a nearby house and put her up in the, made her go up in the attic and she said, you are going here to lay, I will cover you with straw, but you cannot move until I will come back to you. And she was hiding there for, in the attic, for the da y and at night she heard somebody, something moving there. So , she didn't know, is it a mouse, it's human or what. Bu t, she got closer to the place and she touched a han d. And she said, who are you? Ve ry quietly. And she said, I am Sonja Kovaski(ph), which she married, this is my sister-in-law now. And, of course, they couldn't talk any more. They heard the Germans drinking and singing and enjoying and everything. And she didn't know what is going on. And how long sh e is going to be there. No food, no drink, nothing. But this was Friday, until Friday. Friday afternoon she ca me, that woman, took her out from the attic and she says, she dressed her like a farmer, she gave her a pail and a, I don't know, in Polish you call it, kapatchka(ph), but you dig potatoes . And she says, you are going to follow me. She dressed her with a scar f and she brought her in the house and they gave her a glass of milk and a piece of bread, and she says, you are going to your childr en. I'm going to bring you to your children. And, but you cannot mo ve, you cannot look around, you cannot do anything. She did not want to tell her that everybody's k illed already. Because she was afraid in case my mother faints or something, what will she do with her? So, she says, you're going with me. And she brought her to 24 Kokochan. And then he brought her to us because we were in ____________, it was another small village there. And then she told, she came, she told us what had happened. That Thursday they finished all the men killing and Friday there were still some wo men, and where the women are killed, and where the men are killed, and we still could not believe it. Q: This was your whole town? A: Yes. This was, because when my mother, wh en there was, on the prem ises where they were, when they told my mother why they want to save her, and they told her where they are killing the Jews, she came up to, there were two doctors, Jewish doctors. An d she says to them, what should we do because some young people wanted to revolt against it, they said, let's kill at least some Germans. We're getting killed, le t's kill, they didn't le t them because they said, because if you revolt, we'll all get killed. Obviou sly, they would have, they killed them anyway. Bu t, he said to them, so my mother, this is boykavochnik(ph), you are such a smart woma n, you are a business woman. Can you believe that they will kill 4,000 people? No, it 's impossible! They won't do it, they cannot do it! And they made her, she is stupid to believe them. And this is, still when it happened, nobody believed it, that th at's going to happen. We thou ght, they'll make a ghetto. We thought they will take away from us everything. But we could not believe they are going to kill us. We couldn't believe it. And that's how we were fooled all the time. Because we did not believe it. And later on, in experience, every town was a different way of killing. It was always before a Jewish holiday. There was always a diff, there was always with a different excuse. There was not excuses, but they were differently that nobody c ould believe it. Now, my sister was with my mother's family and, until one day came a selection. They took out there. And they put them, they told them to get out in the market. And they, my sister walked with her tw o children with no husband. So, left, right, left, ri ght. And my uncle saw that she goes left and they already heard about what left means. So, he felt like he was goin g to faint and they, from the back they pushed him, like there is no time to faint, you go. Beca use he was going right. An d that's where my sister got killed that day, but this was in 1942. She lived from 194 1 until 1942, she lived with my 25 mother's family. And we were hidin g. Until we feel like we cannot do it anymore. We went to the, in Raddan was a ghetto, we we nt to the Raddan ghetto. Q: So, for this year or so , year and a half, you were hiding in different places? A: We found places, yes. And then it started even worse. When we went to the ghetto. Q: Actually, before you tell me about the ghetto, I just have a couple of questions? A: Yeah. Q: How did you know who to trust? I mean, you seemed to be lu cky, a lot of Polish people weren't so helpful. A: We were one of the very, very lucky people. Because we knew , we, how we did not trust, it's very hard to say. We had trust, too much, later we foun d out we should not trust that much. But in beginning, we trusted because yo u couldn't understand, how ca n somebody hurt us? We were friends! We lived together. We were loved! Among the Poles. We were loved! The workers would cut their necks off for us. They would give everything for us. They would do everything. And how can anybody hurt us ? How can you believe it? Q: And no one double crossed you? A: No. No. Until, no, nobody, until they just said we have to leave. We have to leave. They _____________, the mayor from the village came one day, and so we were with a widow because she was a widow of, one of our worker's mother-in-law, and she ke pt us there. And he came and he told that we have to leave because otherwise the whole village will get killed. So, of course, we did not want to do them any harm, and we said, okay, we are going to le ave. And my brother went to Raddan, the youngest brother, went to Raddan to find out where can we go? What should he do? He came there and they surround , they were looking for people they did not have White Russian passports. And they foun d, because we didn't have, we were Li thuanians already. And they found, the caught about 10 people. It was my brother and one of my cousins and some more and they brought them into the police and they beat him up so badly and we found out what is going on in Raddan. We were still in the village, so we notify that Polish man, he was friendly wi th the mayor of this town of Raddan, and he we nt there and he intervened with them and they let him out. But, 26 my brother came to the village, for a week he couldn't sit down. He could not move. His back was all black, beaten up so badly. And then we realized that whatever w ill be, we have to go to Raddan, to the ghetto. And we went to Raddan, we went, finally, we all get up and we went to Radden to the ghetto. I and my mother and my two brothers. And until we were in the ghetto, it was very uncomfortable, until one night, it was on Saturday night, the Polish man came into the ghetto at night and he said, and he got sc ared, what are you doing here? ______________ is not allowed to get into the ghetto, is not allowed to drive, is curfew at night. And is there only one that protects us, that takes interest in us already. And we were, we didn't want him to, he should get out, he should get killed because of us. He said, I went to sleep and I had a bad dream. And I want, I came to take you out from the ghetto. I said, we'll all get, so you'll get killed and we'll ge t killed. You'll take us out at night to a village? He said, yes, I have prepared a village for you. And I'm going to take you there. Because the dream was a ba d one. He was a great believer. And he took us out and he brought us there. It wa s a widow with child ren, her husband went to th e war and didn't come back. And he told us we ha ve to stay there. End of tape 3. 27 Tape 4 Q: ...continue when we start ag ain. I wanted to ask you... You can start. A: We weren't there too long. Q: In Raddan? A: In Raddan. We weren't there too long. Life was consigned to the room, we had one room. We still had food to eat because the pe ople used to come and bring us food. We did not know what any more can give. What they all can give. We did not. We just existed. Nothing, we did not know a thing, what there will be, what we have to expect. Where we are. But, we weren't there too long. Q: A few months? A: Maybe less, I don't remember. I just remember that not too long. And th en when they took us out, so, then we never return ed any more to the ghetto. Q: In this ghetto, was this a big ghetto? A: No, because Raddan was smaller than Ashashoc. It was a very small town. They had a big Yshiva(ph), they were famous for a big Yshiva. Famous for the bigg est rabbi in the, his name, they used to call him the Rapofitzheim(ph), but there were not, I don't know the po pulation, but it was a very, much smaller than Ashashoc. Q: And was the ghetto, were there Germans in the ghetto or was it all self-patrolled? A: The Germans always were patrolling it. Becaus e it was a curfew, you couldn't go out at night. The minute that it used to get dark, you were locked up in the houses. In the daytime you could jump from one house, maybe to the next, to talk a little. To talk to some people. To see people who were hiding from our to wn, who came there from our town. And, but it was very little conversation there, very little, we didn't know what will be with us. We didn't have a ny hope for bett er, we did not have any hope, we existed, we didn't know wh at to think even what will be. Q: Do you remember your conv ersations with your family? 28 A: We had friends that, before the war my mother us ed to help them a lot, they were poor. And I, one night, we were in the villages, yet, it was before th e holidays. I said, I'm going to get a prayer book. And I risked to go to the to wn from the village w ith, of course, with th e woman's daughter. But she had to go on one side, we always arranged it, that if they catch us, they should not, people should not suffer from us. And I came to these peop le and they say me, they couldn't believe it. They were, where is everybody? Who is alive? B ecause they knew that we, th at they already killed our town. And I say, we are all th e family, except my sister's husb and. And, what can I do for you? We had nothing, I just ran out from the house like I stayed, with nothing, I didn't even have time to put on a pair of shoes. I took the shoes with me and ran out in a pair of slippers. So I said, no, nothing, I really don't, I want a toothbrush. Forget about toothpaste, a toothbr ush and a little salt to be able to brush our teeth. So, she says, no, but you don't need an y underwear or nothing? I said, no, a little towel and a dishtowel. So she brought me and I, and she gave me a prayer book and I went back. But, that's all we wanted. I felt, I always had my prayer book with me. Even when we were warm, the minute I heard the Ge rman's boots walking by the hous e, I took, I used to grab the prayer book and pray. And we were, we were still believe that there would come a miracle. Another day, another day, there will a miracle for us. We, something God has to do for us. It was, but the day never came. It never came. The only one that was right is the Polish man that took us out that night because this was Saturday, Frid ay night and on Sunday, they surround Raddan and they went from house to house a nd we did not have White Russian passports, the took him and they killed him. And we would have been in this part because we did not have Ru ssian passport. And he had the feeling of fear and he took us out at night. It's like a prophet. It's unbelievable. Q: So, during this perio d, instead of being resentful, you prayed harder? A: Yes. We prayed harder. We prayed harder and believed th ere will come a miracle. Every holiday that what, how did we kn ow it's a holiday? We had no calendars, we had nothing. By the sun, by the moon. And we used to _______________, it must be a miracle, it mu st be a miracle. It never came. Now, this woman that we were hiding, the first one th at he brought us from Raddan, I and my mother did not ea t ___________, we did not eat meat. We only had bread or potatoes and 29 she was afraid that we are going to die in her house. So, she went one day to the ghetto and went into a rabbi and asked what should she do. She is hiding Jews and she is afraid we are going to die there. What should she, what ca n? So, he gave her a prayer book and he told her, you bring it home to them and tell them, they, occasionally they feel we ak, they should eat meat. No bones, not any of the bones, just eat a piece of meat for survival. But the future, we did not, I don't think we were thinking hard. I don't thi nk we had the ability of th inking what will happen to us. What should we do? Where should it go? What, we didn't, but we felt like whatever they advised us, this, the first farmer, the one that had the sons that they were hi ring in Polish army and everything, we felt that they are right. The only way we can survive is by hidin g. And I was very mu ch fed up and I was against it. I kept telling to my brother, why do we have to be different? Everybody, all my girlfriends are killed. Ev erybody is killed. Why do we, why do we have to be stubborn and want to leave? What purpose? Wh at? What, they are all killed, nobody is here around us. And he said, I want to live to tell the world what had happened to us. And I used to scream, why do we have to tell the world? The world doesn't think about us, they don't help us. And he said, I want to live it through. He had a vision, he wanted to leave and I was giving up because th e prayers did not help. And this is our, then it started. Of course, this Pole had a big vision and he told us how we can hide. He made hiding places for us in th e houses, but the Poles had a sme ll, somehow they used to feel, that this and this family is hidi ng somebody. They had a very fun ny feeling. If they saw an extra from the chimney, extra smoke is coming out, she is baking bread more th an normally she would bake for herself. This is how th ey used to find out. And if one knew, right away they started the other one, they're starting to talk. And then they used to come to the homes and find and kill them. It was every day that we hear those stories. But, this man watched over us, with making a good hiding place. And he started to have food, and my youngest brothe r was always very daring to go out at night and bring food in. And we lived with the pigs, with the horses, wi th the cows. It's all we, you could talk to them and asking them to why ar e they so lucky? That they are free and we are mice. We are mice. And, but we had to, then we were changing places from one place to another place. He also always divided us. He said if in one place they will catch, he wanted so badly we 30 should survive, that he was, he had a better vision that we did. That we will hide separately then if one part get killed, the other one will survive. And then he brought us into a place and we had a very good hiding place there. We could not hide in his house because himself was hiding already. He was sentenced to death from the Poles, he was sentenced to death from Lithuania, from the Germans, everybody wanted to kill him. Beca use they said he, they called him the Jewish Botchkadik(ph), Father of the Je ws. And they caught hi m once in Ashashoc a nd they beat him up so badly, they brought him in to the, then at night they put him in the hospital. And they were going to shoot him next day. The doctor's wife knew that he is taking care of us and she came in at night to his room and she said, I am going to leave the window open, I want you to run away because they are going to shoot you to morrow morning. And he didn't know how he can, he couldn't move, he had no clothes, he couldn't move. But, somehow, he get up his strength, and he got out, the cold, through the garden, and he came into one of our neighbors, an d he told them what had happened to him and they brought him clothes a nd they let him rest there for a da y or two and they, and he came back and since then, he was hiding himself. Q: What motivated somebod y like him to take such risks for other people? A: I would say, he wanted to show the world what he'd accomplishe d. He was a believer because his mother, his father was dead, and his mother used to, we alwa ys used to hear, Kashmish(ph), what will it be? You'll get killed. Why do you have to do it? And Maria was alwa ys hanging on the, the picture was always hanging on the wall. And he used to sa y, he used to say, darn you and start praying. And he says, mother, I have to do so mething. I want to, they are good people, I want to save them. And she was beggin g him, give up. Give up. You'll get killed because of them. And the minute he used to start with such a belief the he was, he belie ved that he will pull it through. And we brought him here. He used to pray every day, my husband used to take him to every church, anyplace he wanted, he be lieved. And he wasn't considered for a ve ry nice man. For a rough man. But, he so unded like he wanted, he started, he wanted to fulf ill his mission. Q: What did you do all day long when you were hiding? 31 A: I don't, I really can't, and I came to the United States, I'll tell you nights, I used to think, what did they do, what did we do? I had work, I had work, because I had wo rked for the ladies. I helped them in the kitchen. But the rest of the people. How did we survive? Not having a tomorrow, not, we had to think, obviously, what tomorrow will bring us? We didn 't. What did we do? I don't know. I used to get up in the morning, if we set, if we were in the house, I used to help her peel potatoes, make the pancakes for, the men used to co me from the field. I used to wash everybody's laundry, whatever, if you want to ca ll it, but, I don't know what we did. Q: So, you weren't just in some hiding place? You had a little bit of movement? A: Not only, not outside, never outside. Only, I was in the kitchen in certain places. In some places, I didn't, we were there day and night. It depends which place. We were once in a place that everybody died from typhus. And we were still there in that house and we didn't catch it. Only one child survived. The father and the mother and the sister, they all died from typhus. They were in their house and we were in a small, in a very small corner that you could not ev en move like this. It used to come a holiday, people there used to come to visit sometimes. We were sitting in certain cellars, sitting, could never move. We couldn't turn over from one side to another side. We had to sit like this. Was there a little, some food is okay, for two, three days we never could move. There were times, but we, I can't unders tand today, what, how we did it. I can't. It was winter, it was a very cold winter. We had no clothe s. We had no water to, in times that we were in a barn that we did not have to wash ourselves. But she used to bring in one pail of water for 10 people, for example, sometimes more. So we had one cup of water for each one. So, one cup we used to drink and the other cup we used to just wash ourself a li ttle. How can a person survive like this? I don't know. I don't know. Q: How long did you stay in one place? You said you had to move around. A: In one place we stayed about a year, more than a year. Until her brother came. When we were there, it was okay. We had a very good, like here is the stove a nd under the stove was the hiding place. And the minute that the Germans are passing by, we used to run there, close, and it was good. But she wanted, so me more people came to her for he lp. And she was a very, she was a 32 widow, she had four children , and they came in, this was a place that we stayed a long time. This is the place. That I am skipping so me other places before. That sh e, they came, th is was the White Poles, not the Germans. We left there. Her brot her came to tell that we should leave because they are talking about that she has Jews. And this is when he found out about the sm oke of the chimney. The smoke is going out too often, that means she is baking brea d for some Jews. And, we, the Polish man came, the one that took care of us, and he transferred us to another place. But there did remain still 10 people. Two of my cousins, one with the family, his wife and child and another one. And day they came, the Wh ite Poles came in on a Sunday. The b oys weren't there, they were just two little, two small girls, a 10 year old and an 8 year old girl. And they said you have to show us where you hide the Jews. And she says, I have no Jews. A nd she said, we know you have, you have to tell us where. And she didn't. And they looked all over and they could not find them. Because this was really the best hiding place. And she, and all of a sudden, he took his rifle and he hit it on the floor and it discharged. And he hit hims elf, blood started to go from his chin. And the girls were afraid, they saw blood, it is killing the mother, so they said, come on, I will tell you where the Jews are. And she went and she showed. And they took him out. It was in January, on the snow, and they laid him out and they killed him. Except my cousin and his wife and his child. He was raised on a farm close to th ere, close to where they were, he was raised in, this was in Debinik(ph), they, this village, and he was raised in Paradna(ph), a small, and the __________ of the White Poles was in Paradna. And they took him there and th ey kept them three days and tortured them. They should say where, he should tell them where we are. Because they knew that we are helping him with food and everything. And he did not tell. On the third day they killed him. And he was such, so beloved among the Poles. He was in the Polish army, he was raised on a farm together with the farmers. It didn't matter, they killed him. But the main thing was to them to find us. Because they were so stupid, they thought that where we are, we have the mone y with us. So they were going for money, too. But this, and then after, we were in a place that apart, I was with my brother and my cousin, with hi s mother and father in another place. And we were at also a hiding place. But we could see that if nobody co mes into the house, we could sit in the kitchen. 33 Actually, the whole household wa s in one room. There was no such a thing as a kitchen or a bedroom or something. There were beds near the wall and the st ove and the table and that was everything. And under the stove, we had our hidi ng place. And when we were not in the hiding place, we had somebody sitting in the window and watching. And my cousin was on the watch that moment, and all of a sudden he turns around and he says , let's hide. I see, I don't know, they look to me like women, but they have long coats, it was winter. And wh at happened, he couldn't see from far away. But, my brother went to the window an d he gives a look and he said, hurry up, let's run and hide, let's run and hide, because they have guns. They have rifles under th eir coats. If they are Germans, if they are Poles, we did not know. But, as we ran and were hiding and she put the chickens under the stove and my brother was sitting near the little door and he was, he heard them coming in and speaking to her in Polish. And he said to us, like we should say goodbye to each other. That's it. We are gone. They catching us . And they were poking and poking all over. And then they said, let's go to the barn . The couldn't find. So , the noise of the chic kens also threw them off, the noise, because they were disturbing the chic kens. And they went to the barn and they were beating her, her husband wasn't home, and the children, lucky that the children were not home. And she kept saying, I don't have Jews, I'm not hiding Je ws. I don't know what you want from me. And they looked all over, they didn't fi nd us and they left. This was a miracle. If you want to know a miracle, this was a miracle. Q: These were Poles? A: Poles. But other ones, al so by the Poles, got killed. Q: And there were Germans around, as well? A: There were the Germans. They never came in the village. Occasionally, they used to pass by. I know once, I was by myself in one place and they said th ey are expecting the Germans and they send me out to a fore st to hide. And I went an d I found a tree that leaves, the needle tree was almost underground and I laid down under the tree. And I had to wait until somebody will come and give me notice to come out. So I was laying in that place, I will never forget it, I was talking to my father all the time. Help me, he lp me. I'm in great danger an d I'm all by myself. Because the 34 family was in a different place. We were supposed to be settled in this woman's house, and I was supposed, I was the first one, but since the hiding place wasn't ready and they were expecting the Germans to pass through the village, they didn't know what they will do. If they will stop down at, then she was afraid and she sent me out there. And then it was getting dark, the came and they said I can get out. They just passed by the village, the did not get into the village. Q: So you were more afraid of the Poles? Than the Germans? They seemed to be around... A: Just the same. Just the same. Because one day, I and my oldest brother, we were passing through, we had to go to change places and it was in the daytime, we were dressed like peasants, and we're both going, and it was in th e middle of the day. That was ve ry daring, of course, to do it, but we thought, well, it's the middle of the day, the farmers ar e already going home to rest, because they always worked until about 11, 12 o'clock, and then they go rest. An d then we'll not have too far to go, a few kilometers. And as we are going, one man was work ing and we don't look even at that side, and he stops us, _____________, he said, do you have leat her to sell? So, we got very frightened. We said, no, we have nothing now. We have nothing. An d we just kept on going. But, we especially could not hide, b ecause everybody knew us. We could not go, like some people used to work from one place to another as long as they did not look like Jews. We could not. Everybody knew us. One day... Q: Let me stop you here so we can change the tape. And then we'll pick up there, okay? End of tape 4. 35 Tape 5 ...was in the Partisans, because thanks to him, my husband survived, beca use my husband was in Partisans, one Jew in the Russian Pa rtisans. And he was a doctor th ere. Originally was a dentist, but he's a doctor, so they did need him. They were afraid to kill my husband. Q: Now, I'm not, do we remember where we left off? I usually write it down, but I didn't. A: It was the 10 people th at were in the hiding plac e where we were over a year. Q: Okay. Actually, I do have a qu estion. Are we, we're going? Okay . I do have a question. Now, this man who came and t ook you out of the Raddan ghetto, did he help you find all of these hiding places? A: Yes, he did. All the places. Q: So, he took care of you? A: Yeah. He took care of us until the end. But, end, we got free from hi s house. Because nobody, there was no place to go. When they burned, a nd the place where I told you where we left, we changed places. And there were 10 people left and the Poles came and they found them. The woman, you know, the child ren told them where the hiding place and they killed them and they took her down to the basement and they burned everything. They burned their life and all of the wealth, she was a very wealthy woman. Q: This is the widow? A: The widow. And they burned her with everything. The children, the little girls that survived and, lucky that the men, the two boys weren't home. Because if they were home, if they would be home, they would kill them, too. Q: Now, is this the place where you also met other peop le who were in hiding? The _______________ family? A: When we got out from there, after the fire, and every places where only Jews were around, they will send out. We got out in the middle of the night, in the fiel ds, not knowing what to do. We were standing and praying somebody should come and shoot us. Get ri d of it. Just, we were all got out with whatever we had on our ba cks, a few things. And we did not know what we have to do. 36 So, the only way to go, is to go to this Pole's house. And we knew he is not home, but he should let us into the barn, because people w ill not think that he is hiding Je ws now in the house. So, we can get into the barn and just digging ourselves, becaus e there was a lot of _______, a lot of things, and until ____________ made to go to Raddan, because he is hiding himself. The mayor of Raddan is a good friend of his. So, he is around them, hiding them himself. And notify him, they know where he is, and notify them that we are in his house, we have no place to go . Take us to the Partisans, or he should shoot us, or to do what ever they want to do with us. That is the end, we cannot do anything more. So, when we came , as we were standing, two Jews passed by and they found us and he said, I'll give you a place. So, they took us up to a place, the name was Doomlay(ph), or Dorman(ph), I don't remember that name. And they notify him where we are, when we dug into the barn when we were sitting there. Next day he came and he said, okay, we'll make a place to hide here. And you'll stay here for awhile. And we'll see what will be, but he said, it's, the war will come to an end. We don't know when, but it's goi ng to, the Germans are, the Russians are defeating the Germans. And he came, when he dug out a place for us and we were there, 10 people. Next morning comes in the man, he says , you told me only 10 people, th ere is 20 here. We said, no, count. Count us, we are only 10. No, there is 20, there is 20 people, I can't ke ep you. Anyway, we beg him, of course, we paid a lot of money for these places. And he... Q: So you still had money with you? A: Yes. We had. On e of our workers dug out our money and he brought, to a penny, didn't touch one piece of gold or one dollar. He brought, they were so devoted to us, he brought us the money, but we never carried it with us. We always used to hide it someplace, wherever we were. And for the places, this Pole that took care of us, did not ta ke money from us. But th e other places were paid with gold. So, we were there a couple of days a nd all of a sudden we get up one night, we are all flooded. That place. It was, water came in. Almost drowning ours elf in the water. Anyway, we got out and we notified him again, what should we do ? So, he said, there is, I'll come and I'll find something what we can do. He went to the woods a nd he brought in young tr ees and they spread it out, that went like a ____________ ___, and he dug out where our feet are. He dug out a ditch and 37 the water used to get into one place and a couple of times during the night, we had to get out and take out the water and that's the way we were sleeping and getting up, sleep ing and getting up. Until he said, you have to go. I can't keep you. I'm afraid. So th at time, we decided to go to his house and that's the end. Take us to the Partisan s, or kill us, or do whatever you want, it must come to an end. And my brother, we had a gun with one shell. My cousin was tall so he took a stick pretending that he has ammuniti on. And we were standing in th e field and my cousin and my brother, the youngest brothe r, because my older brot her was always afraid. He knew one thing, he want to survive. He did not kn ow what to help, but he did not find, think what he can help, but only, he wants to survive. So it means if nobody sees him, he'll su rvive. My younger brother and my cousin went to the window and they knocked on the window, and they asked the possessors, that's the help that he left to do his ground. They should let him in and they said they will not let him in. So my brother said to th em, you know, look at the gun. I' m going to kill you if you won't let me in. So you have to let us in. If you don't want us, we will not stay, but we have to have that you should go to Raddan a nd bring Kashmish(ph) here and he has to help us to deci de what to do. Maybe he can transfer us to the Partisans. Because we were not too far from, they call it Natchaputche(ph), where the Partisans were there. And we have no place to go, you must do for us something. So, we came there. And they were af raid for the gun, which ob viously, could not shoot. And they, he said, you don't have to let us into the house. Just let us in the barn. Let us in where the cows, let us in where the horses are. Let us in where the pigs are. Anyplace, a corner that we can get in. And she was afraid and they let us in. But we did not know th at the same night that we were, they opened th e door and told us to go out, the same as where Yaffa(ph) was with her family, hiding. Because the house was burning and the wo man was burned alive. So they opened up the doors and out. Q: Yaffa Elliach(ph)? A: Yaffa Elliach with her family wa s already in his house. They were already there, but they were in, there was a hiding place in the house. So, they were there, but they did not tell us. So, they let us into the barn. The next day he came home and he said, I cannot let you go to the Partisans. 38 Because the war is coming to an end. The news are going to be showing much better the Russians are defeating the Germans. And they and you have, and I want you to surviv e. So, what we'll do, I'll build, nobody think I have Jews now. They woul dn't think I do because I'm hiding myself. I'll make a new hiding place where the ho rses are. And you'll hide there and we'll see what will be. I want you to survive. And we dug over night a hiding place and we were sitting there and then the ____________ came out and they introduced themselv es. They are there, too. And another couple of Jews are there. Q: And you knew that from before? A: It's my cousins. Yaffa's fath er was real cousins be cause his mother and my father were sisters and brothers. But in the beginning, of course, everybody wants to surviv e. Nobody wanted to identify. Except, I'll tell you, my mother. My mother until the last minute was still looking maybe she can save somebody. Maybe she can bring so mebody and save somebody . And the more she brought people in, the less chance we had to su rvive. And the less mone y we had to buy food. Q: Where was she finding peop le to bring in and save? A: We took out from Vilna(ph) gh etto, three people. We found __ _____ from the labor place, we found my cousin, that he was with us. And my co usin, the other cousin, with his wife and child, one he did not give us out where we are. He could have tell where we are because he knew where we are. And they would go right away and catch us. But we paid for it. The night before they got killed, my brother was there bringing him foo d. And they beg him he should stay overnight there. And he said, no, I'll go back to my people. Q: So, you're telling me that, while you were hiding, you were still able to help other people? A: Yes. Q: That's amazing. A: That was my mother. That was my mother. She did not look that she won't have it for tomorrow, but she has it today and it was still looking, we had a cousin, he was an engineer in a small town near Ashashoc. We se nt four times for some body to bring him. A nd he kept delaying. He couldn't believe that they cannot run the factory, it was a paper factor y. That they will not be 39 able to run the factory from him because he star ted it in Germany and he was working there all his life. That how can they, they won't run and th ey won't kill him. But it came when we sent the last time, he was gone already. It wa s too late. We had a druggist in Liptenshoc, that they left him alive. They killed everybody and left him b ecause they did not have another druggist in the town. So they let him. We kept begg ing him, we'll take him out. And until it came a day that we sent again, next week, next week, the next week didn't come. It came a day that he was gone. They killed him. Q: So you would try to help people, y our Polish people would help you get them? A: Yes. For every time they we nt to town to bring somebody, was paid off very well. ________ gold. Q: You were starting to tell me th at at one point you had to go into one of the towns and you went into a church. What was that? A: Yeah. This was when I wanted to meet this mayor of this town. And see what he can do for us. Maybe he can help us. To hide as Poles was im possible because our accent wasn't good. To go deep in Poland. To stay here, it was impossible, ever ybody knew us. So, but, we wanted to take out the children, my sister and the children from the ghetto. Because we knew there would come a day they will get killed. Besides that, we didn't know tomorrow brings us either. So, we, we decided he'll take me to this, Schmigera(ph) was his name. We'll meet him in church and we'll talk to him and see what he can do for us. That night I was resting in the attic, I and my mother I remember, I had a dream. I had a dream, ______________. And I highly believed that this can come to something. You know, you start believing in things which, you know, we never did. We believed in dreams. We belie ved, there was a lot of su perstition going on. And I thought, that dream means something because the translation is , there'll come a day that a bear will leave to gether with the ship, kavish(ph). And maybe there will come a peace that they'll want us to leave. So, I will go to the church because I've never been to a church and, accordingly, we were not supposed to enter the church, believers. And I went with him, I wa s dressed like a peasant, and we came into ___________ house and he introduced me that I am a cousin from another place, he brought me, 40 and we are going to church . And we went and I told him, I'll fa il because I don't kn ow what to do. Whatever I'll do, you go after me, you do. And then ______________ came to us in church and he said he cannot talk to us now. But they are building a new church at the end of the town. I should, after we get through here, he should take me there and he will talk to me. So we met him and I told him the story so he can make us ou t Polish papers. All of us. An d maybe we can survive as Poles, but we have to go away from this neighborhood. So, I said no, because our Polish accent will give us out right away. Because we spoke Polish more like the White Russians, not like in Warsaw, like _____________. So I said ab out to give away the children, then we'll take at least the sister with us. So he said, I'll try. I'll try ev erything because I will not forget what you di d for me. During the Russian occupation, that he was hi ding, his wife was already sent to Siberia. This Pole was his cousin and he used to come during the market day [phone ringing]. After the church, we went there and we met him. And he told me what he can do, he said, alright, he will see what he can do about the children. And next day he gave us an answer. He gave us the answer that he has a very good place, and we knew, because we knew everybody. And I knew that this is, it cannot be it was a miracle. It was a big, rich farmer, they were very good people. Very nice. And they will take the two children to raise them. And we notified my sister. Ev erything wasn't easy. Because everything got, _______________, ther e was no communication, no telephones, nothing. And she said she is not giving the children, she wants to die wherever the children are, together. So, we failed on this. Then I went into the ghetto and I met some peopl e from our home town. And they were talking and they told me what they suffer from this man. And to us he is an angel. So, a nd I should talk to him. And I talked to him and he told me why he wants, he does not ta ke revenge from all the Jewish people, only ones, the people that they, it was their fault to send his wife to Siberia. But, anyway, he got, he was, he really was better. Because, as I said, we did him a lo t of favors, by not giving him out to the Russians, by, I used to open up the ba ck door and let him in to meet his cousin. I gave him a warm, and meals, also, if they want, I us ed to always leave someth ing for them to eat in the room and they used to see it and talk and then disappear. All our life was like this. And that's 41 what, we went again from place to place. We went into hiding and my sister, that was in 1942 when my sister got killed, in May, 1942. Q: What was the na me of that town? A: Vasilishoc(ph). Those pictures we just looked at were Vasilishoc. They were, all the towns were connected, they were not connected like here, for example. You get out it's Pasadena, ____________, but they were no t a lot of distances, just, you know, maybe seven kilometers, maybe 14 kilometers from each ot her. And, but they were all sma ll towns. Ashashoc was the best, was famous because we had a good communication between Vilna, Lider, Gordna(ph) and we had the bus passing through. It was like a freeway going through town. But, otherwise, those small towns didn't have a bus coming in . They didn't have a taxi. We didn't have taxis, either. Right before the war, some taxis us ed to pass through town. Q: When you went into this church, were you nervous? A: Very much. Very much. Because I was afraid that God is going to punish me. Q: You were afraid God was going to punish you for going into the churc h, not of getting caught by the Polish people? A: No, I wasn't, I knew there, I am in good hands. Because I'm not exposed to the, to out around the public, just in church. And I was dressed just like a Po lish girl. Couldn't tell. Q: But you were afraid you we re going against your faith? A: Faith, yes. Q: You didn't feel forsaken by your faith at all? A: No, but, I don't know. We were, and we weren't that religi ous, in our house. We weren't that religious. We kept all the, y ou know, everything kosher and this and that, but we weren't very religious. But I always am with people today, very religious. I felt like if we would have a father, we would probably be also as religious as my fr iends, because my friend s were very religious. Q: Did you have any contact with Partisans? A: No. But we knew that they ex ist. We knew who are the head of them. Because we knew them. We knew where they are because one time, I and my youngest brot her and my sister were a short 42 time in a place, they were right in the pasture, in that, where th e Partisans are. We were there in the middle. And that wa s a very good place to hide. Because his son, that Polish man, his son went to work for the Germans. He was a policeman, he got killed. So nobody would ever believe that he has Jews in his house. But, there was once, they call it a blav a(ph), they surround, the Germans surrounded the, this, the woods and were trying to kill, some people got killed during it. And this ___________ was just moving arou nd, going forth and ba ck from the bombs and from the grenades and from everything. And then we decided to leave, I did not, we didn't want to stay there. Q: So there was a big, strong German presence and you were very aware of the war? A: Oh, we were aware, they had, there were Polish people that they told the, used to be in contact with the Partisans. There were some. The Polish people, when they organized against the Jews, but not all of them. They were not, th ere was a cousin of th is Polish man that we were survived by him, this ______________. That he was called to join the White Partisans. And we were afraid, he was, he ran away from a big to wn, came to survive in this village because the Germans, the Germans or the Russians, I don't know, did something to his pa rents, and when he was called to join the White Partisans, he, we were afraid, th e risk, this __________ Jews, and he could not lie. He was a very honest and not smart man. And we knew that he will tell, yes. So every night we used to bring him into our hiding place and he used to ________________. You have to go, obvious ly, they call you. Otherwise, they will kill you. But, if they will ask you, what will you tell them? _________________, I will never say that. I will not, I will never give, but we couldn't trust him. And every night we used to like, bother him, what will you do? And he kept saying, always crossing his heart and saying, cross my heart, I will not say, and he fina lly went and he did not. He did not tell that we are hiding there. Q: He checked on you all the time? A: No, after he left to the Partis ans, he never came, we never saw him. Now, I know where he is now. We write, we exchange cards for Christma s, when the Polish man was here, I sent him money. I met his sister one day in Israel, but two y ears ago, almost three years, I met her in Israel. Sent him money, he is an engineer. Very intell igent man, but I never saw him. Like this Polish 43 man, Edward(ph) Shepard(ph), now he was, at that time, probably 10 or 12 years old, maybe less. We never saw him. I only saw his silhouette. Standing near the kettle and watching them in a big coat, dressed. And I never saw him in his face. Because we were hiding, not Yaffa or the other ones, they saw him because he used to come in to eat in the house. But we were in the barn, we never came into the house. So, no w he is alive. We write to him. Send him money. We are in contact with him. But, I never knew who he is. Q: Do we need to change the tape? End of tape 5. 44 Tape 6 A: They would kill him just as they would kill us. Q: Because he was harboring Jews? A: Because he was, ye s, because they knew. Q: Was he the one, who, oh, don't stop. A: Because the difference from this boy to the other ones, the other ones couldn't even sign their names. They couldn't wr ite. He came from a big town. And he came becau se he had no way, all the family was sent out someplace. And he was intelligent. He used to go with the polk(ph), how do you say in English, plock(ph), y ou know, to work on th e, to work the grou nd. Everybody that came to this farmer's, they had to work, they ha d to know how to work on the farm. And he was going with his book. He was holding in one hand the book, he was studying himself, he was learning himself, and he was working in the field. And we alwa ys used to make fun of him, how could he do it? And at night he used to teach hims elf algebra and he was, he was, he was a different breed, because some, like the shepherd, the shepherd couldn't ev en sign his name, he never saw a school. So, we knew he was differ ent, but what we knew, he is such an hone st man, he cannot lie. Q: And this is the cousin of your savior? A: Yes, of our savior, yes. Q: Now, during all this time, how much information did you have about the outside world and what was happening in the camps? Did you know anything? A: We did not know. We didn't kn ow what is going on with the d eath camps. We did not know what day is today. Except just looking by the moon we knew what, if it's the beginning of the month or the end of the month or whenever it is. And the only thi ng we knew, Yaffa kept, the first time when we met, she says, do you still have your prayer book wi th you? Becaus e every place I went, I went with my pr ayer book. And by the en d, I lost it in the Pigonne(ph). And I saw her the first time in the United States sh e said, do you have your little prayer book. And I said, no I don't have it, I left it in the house and everything was destroyed. Q: What else? You were in hiding, really from... 45 A: From '41 until '44. Q: Any other aspect to all of that you want to talk about? A: Do you want to know about ____________ ___ after the war when we came back home? Q: I do, but first, I want to know how you found out you were liberated. But, in the hiding, in all these places, you hid in differen t places and you basically had somebody who helped you find places and some of them you had... A: We couldn't, we coul d not do one thing without him. We didn't, everything was his, now one time I got sick and my foot swelled up very badly and he came to visit us and he almost fainted when he looked at my foot. Because I asked, what will it be? You have to kill me. I can't run to hide. It was red and swollen. And he said, I wi ll see what we can do. He went to one of our friends, an old lady that her so n was a shoemaker and he, we knew hi m. And he told her what had happened to me and she went to the river and picked some leaves from the lilies, the white lily leaves and she gave him to bring it to me. And a piece of old linen and white flour and she said, let her put on the leaves and this will take off the re dness and the swelling a little and then it will start itching, I should put on. He wasn't satisfied that this can help me . He went to the doctor in Ashashoc and he told him that he knows that we are hiding. And the doctor was a German, his name was Leah(ph), but he was, we knew him, we knew him. It's different with people that they know everybody. And he said to me, he said, I will give you an ointment and you take it out to her. And he brought it to me and my foot healed up. Othe rwise, I, I said, the only survival, the only help we could have, I said, shoot me. Because I don't wa nt other people should get killed because of me. Q: Do you think there was any difference in your experiences because you were a girl instead of a boy? A: No. I was more help than almo st a boy. I could wash the laundr y, I cut their hair with the not scissors, with the scissors they cut the sheeps, I wouldn't be able to hold it in my hand now. Cut their hair, washed, make something to eat for them, mend, I wa s doing everything. Q: And no one tried to take advantage of you? 46 A: No. No. We were a ll in the same house. I didn't have, for example, a dress to change. And there was men around, what do you do if you have to wash it? I had an apro n. I used to put on an apron in front and just go all the time to th e front where the apron is. Until it dries. Q: I mean, I'm just curious, women have things they have to take care of and then when you're in such unusual circumstances, it must be difficult. A: It, I don't know, we didn't feel so difficult. The only thing what we, what was di fficult is when it was very cold. And we did not ha ve warm clothing. This is then we were all, we were sleeping 10 people together. Q: Did you have your period throughout this whole time? A: For a long time I didn' t have a period. It disappeared. For a long time, maybe about a year and a half or more. Q: Maybe it was nutritional or... A: Yes. Our gums, in ab out a few months after we left the h ouse, our gums started to bleed. Now what should we do? We don't kn ow what to do. So the farmer advised us we should eat onion and garlic. My brother got out and he bought a sack of garlic and a s ack of onion and if we had bread, we used to take, that's what we used to eat, a pi ece of bread with garlic and onion. Because there was no food, there was no, absolutely nothing, especially for us that we did not want to eat meat. But by the end we, I and my mother, started to eat meat. But the meat was, we didn't have enough. Q: Coming from a home that was ver y, very comfortable, you had to adapt a lot. I mean, you were not a farmer. A: No. Q: What was the most diff icult thing to adapt to? A: The most difficult thing was for me once, he brought me to a place on the way to Vasilishoc, it was a farm, there was a wi dow there with children and he said he wants, he was do ing a transaction that he wanted to separate the fami ly in three places. To find three places to have us. And he told me, this Polish man, he brought him there and he sa id, I am a relative and I had a fight at home and I want to run away from the house and he'll leave me there for a short time. And being there and 47 since I am from a farm, I have to know how to feed a cow, how to feed a horse, how to milk a cow, how to work in the barn to make the grain come ou t from, you know, you have to work with this. I didn't know. I got out at night and I'm going with them to feed the cows with a younger daughter because, obviously, she's, the younger daughter is younger than I am, the daughter, but she knows what to do. And I am afraid to go near the horse and I am afraid to go near the cow. The cow we had I would maybe cope with it, but I don't know ho w to milk a cow like they milk. And I insist I have to learn, I have to do it. So, it didn't take long, next day I was feeding the cow, I wasn't afraid for the horse, I went to them in the morning to th e woods to cut trees down for, because there was no men in the house, it was all women. And young childre n. To cut the trees, but I'll tell you, every tree that I cut that ground was soaked with my tear s. This I remember. There was so much tears in that forest that I tell, this is how we are, be cutting us down. Like I should not cut the trees because why do I do it to the trees when we've been cut down like this? This I can, I don't, I never I think repeated it, but I couldn't take to cut down a tr ee. I couldn't. And I was going and I was cutting down the tree and I was crying bitterly and came home an d make dinner for them. I was there, and then on Sunday, I had to hide my self because they were already, the girl was prob ably 14, 15, and boys are coming. And I was afraid to be there. Maybe they will recognize that I'm Jewish. So I used to tell them that I am very sick and I'm very tired and I used to get into the barn and dig in myself all the way on the bottom a nd hide. Until one day a doctor was passing from, walking from Vilna to Gordna and this was on th e road from Vilna to Grodna, that village. And I made a soup with milk and he was very hungry and he stopped an d, of course, they used to give people to eat because he was, constantly people were passing by. And he said, and after he ate he said, oh, I haven't had a meal like this in a long time, who made that me al? And I heard him talking, I disappeared, of course, right away from the house, but I thought it over and I said, I'll never make another meal, there was little bowls from potatoes with milk. And, obviously, on the farms they did not make it. That was a Jewish me al. And I never did it again. I said , no. Until I did not, I was not secure there. I thought something will happen to me by the end there. Th ere was too many people, I learned how to make the grain, I learned ho w to make _________ ____ out of, I learned 48 everything, I learned, and in a very short time, but I felt someda y they will recognize that I am not doing like they are doing. And we notified him he should come and pull me out, I cannot be by myself. Q: In a situation like that, when you were separa ted from your family, we re you worried that you might not see them again? A: Yes. Yes. We never knew wh at the hour can bring us. We never knew about it. Now, for example, when I left that place, I had, at that time I had a sack with some clothe s already. He picked up, this man picked up, I told him where they were hidde n, but they were dressy clothes, I couldn't wear it anyway, there was w ool dressed and I couldn't wear it. I wasn't allowed to wear it. She told, and I was, when he came to pick me up, she said, the clothes disappeared, somebody had stolen the clothes. Of course, I did not bring up to a thing that's a tragedy, I said, okay, it's alright. To them it meant something, to me it doesn't even mean anything. I le ft everything, as long as I got out alive from there. Because I was sure I will not get out aliv e from there. After that man recognized that the food is not the same and they ar e coming in constantly, boys to the girl and I disappear in that time, by the end they will come out, who is she? Who is she? It's a mystery, I'm there and I'm not there. But ____________ thinkin g, I don't know, we didn't, if we would have the brains to think a lot, I think we should have commit suicide. And you kn ow, nobody committed suicide, very little. Unless they knew the Germans are going to kill them, they were waiting for to be definitely killed. Otherwise, there was very little suicide. But I was thinking, why didn't we do it? Why did we have to suffer ? Like this? You' re completely not a human being any more. Q: You must have had a st rong will to survive. A: My brother, my brother said he wants to be the one to tell the world what had happened to us. And he's the one, he was like a rabbit hiding and nothing, did not do anything. My younger brother was the main supplier. He is the man that, he is the one that was risking hi s life for everybody to bring these people food and these, and get out and get the food, because we had no problem getting the food, there was just the risk to go out to get it. The Polish people would give us. Q: How old were your brothers at the time, about? 49 A: My older brother, it's 1942, or 1941, '42, he wa s born in 1910, so he was 30 some years, 30 years old. And then the second one wa s my brother that died from le ukemia and the third one was my sister, and I was the fourth. Q: And then your younger brother? A: My younger brother wa s, oh, we were all a year and thr ee-quarters. My mom, that's what mamma, actually, I don't ev en know when I was born. I just, Ya ffa just got some documents so she will find out. Because when I aske d, when I came to the United St ates, I asked my mother, when is the date that my birthday is? She said, when we were all picking berries. So I took it in June. Because this is the time that we pick berries. Because we, I had, some of my girlfriends had birthday parties, not too many, occasionally. An d I used to come home and ask my mother, why can't we have a birthday party? My mother used to always say, you don't have a father, there's no holidays. She gave us everything what we wanted and we helped in the business, I used to go to school and excuse myself at 12 :00 and be home and work in the business. My brothers stopped schools, they were in the business. Everybody was helping. We got, I could get any amount of money I want, everything was open for us. We ha d beautiful clothes always, made, everything, but when it came to holidays, she always let us know, we don't have a fath er. And my mother could have remarried very easily, very easily. But she did not want another father for us. Because she only lived with him 10 years. And he passed away from the epidemic. Q: Tell me how libera tion came about for you. A: We were sitting in a ba rn and he came from Ra ddan that day. And he said, the news is very good, because the mayor used to get newspapers. Now, he didn't get a thing, because he couldn't read a newspaper anyway. He woul dn't, he didn't bring it to us. So , but we heard at night, every night we used to hear airplanes running. Becaus e, as a matter of fact, Yaffa's mother got, was pregnant and she had a baby. And they brought her, they were hiding in the house. So they brought her to our hiding place to have the baby. And we didn't know what to do with her. Because the minute the baby will start crying, we have to hide, we have to, we are finished. So that night he came from Raddan, that Polish man, and my brother and her father took the baby, pick ed it up in a 50 basket and we thought, who is the righteous, who is the best man in the villages around, and they took the baby and they went there at night and they tied it up under the ceiling and they left the baby and there was a note, take him to the church and christen him. And they we re so foolis h, they, some of the pilots, but we heard every night, Russian planes passing by. That one of the pilots was a woman and she had a baby and they dropped the baby. They did not think it is a Jewish baby. And they raised the baby and the baby was okay until it got killed. Q: When you heard these Russia n planes, did it give you hope? A: Hope. We have, we had hope, but we were afra id for the day when they will come. We did not know, how can we get out and show our faces? How can we face the world, ho w can we look at people that they wanted to kill us? That they robbed us. For what? I have some pictures that one of our workers brought us in the ghetto and brought us to the ghetto. He found the pictures on the floor, whatever he found, he got into the house because we had a little dog and the dog didn't want to leave the house and constantly sitting and crying. So he came in to get a blanket, something from the house to take him to his house, and he found the pictures a nd he brought them to the ghetto to Raddan. And we couldn't understand how can we go on living to look at people that, some were good and helped us, some just wanted to get rid of us. That was the hardest part that we did not know how we will survive, how we can go on in life. And that, we didn't th ink it will be so fast, but that night a lot of airplanes were passing above us . And he came in, he cam e home that time. And he came into our barn and he sh owed us that in case they bomb and the barn catches on fire, there was insurance, so the grass was hi gh, he took out a rock from the, and we should get through there and run to the fields. This is what he prepared for us. On Saturday morn ing, afternoon, we see the Germans are coming into the village and starting to station themselves. Put up their equipment, to put the fence, and I thought, here, this is the day that we are dying. We got to, we lived to and that is the date we are going to die. Because no way will we survive. The village will catch on fire, we have no place to run. We can run th rough the grass, but that will be hot, too. But that's the end of us. In about half, they had just started like you put out now, the equipment, they started to settle and in no time came an order they have to leave. They left, they were about, they stationed themselves 51 only about five kilometers from there and in about half an hour we saw all the village there is on fire. It's burning. This was luck, this was luc k, you have to call it fate. That was luck. And of course, next morning we knew that they are all gone. That for us was the end of the war but we were afraid to go to town. We di dn't know what to do. But we knew if we will stay longer and they will think that he has Jews in the house, we'll be killed there from the White Po les. So my brother and Yaffa's father, they went to Ashashoc because it was only three kilometers we were hiding from Ashashoc. And they went ther e and they met some people and they met some Russian people, Russian soldiers and they told them to wait another couple of days because it 's insecure to come right now. Because they are _____ ___ right now and a minute later Germans can retreat and come back. So we waited a couple of days. Of course, we did not sleep, we did not eat, we were alert all the time and then we decided we must go because we cannot stay here. A nd we went to town, we came in to our house, I want to think about th e three kilometers walking to the house. And imagining the town with Jews, without my friends, without everybody. And I don't know how we made it, I think we were numb. We did not think what we are doing. We were numb. And we came into our house and it an elderly couple living a nd they got very scared and we told them not to be scared. They'll have to move out eventually, but they can still st ay until they find a place to stay. Of course, there's nothing there. We bought some lumb er and we made some little beds and picked up a few pillows and we were about 20 people in our house, all single people. Anybody that was single came to my mother. My mo ther was their mother, everybody. We ourselves did not have yet what to eat, but we knew we will not be short on food. They will br ing us food. Everybody will bring us food so we won't, we didn't worry . And did remain in the house until the end. Q: So how long did you remain in the house? A: We came in June. It was the holidays, we had a __________ ____. We had Russian soldiers stopping in the house, we made a prayer, we took one, we were pray ing there. We had an incident, we got poisoned from food. I an d my brother almost died that ni ght. One night, it was innkeeper night. Until when was the pogrom? I, October, from the 19th to the 20th. We lived at home, there was only about four or five ________ from Jews, but we had a lot of people in our house, coming, 52 going, coming, going. My sister friend, Abe's wife used to come, she was left alone, all the parents died, got killed, they were in th e Partisans. And she was the only one alive, everybody was in our house. And in the morni ng, one woman brought us laundry and she said, you know, I want to tell you something. Be aware, the Wh ite Poles are going to kill you. I would suggest you should not sleep at home. But, except, ag ain, we were the only family they would tell us. And I got very scared and I was alerting everybod y, let's not sleep at home. We ha ve nothing, what do we have in our homes, nothing. Let's try an d see what, how we can protec t ourselves. Why we need protection? There was no, the Ru ssian army, because they were, the Germans were moving, they were moving more to Russia, they were almost near Minsk(ph), they were past Minsk, they were already near, they were deep in Russia. And the deeper they were, the more, the main police used to go with them. So... (ph) Q: Finish your sentence please. A: So, she, we didn't know what to do and we, and I was, I kept walking from one house to one house to the other house, would tell them, let's not sleep at night, because that's what she told me. And they said, I'm off my mind. Yo u got off your mi nd, you are crazy. End of tape 6. 53 Tape 7 Q: So, you tried to wa rn people and they all thought you were crazy? A: Crazy. And I said, I'm not going to sleep at night. I'm going to sleep in the garden. We had a big garden right at the end of the ho use. I'm going to stay there all night and I'm not going to sleep. All of a sudden, my younger brothe r wasn't home with his wife and my older brother wasn't home. They were in Vilna, Yaffa's father was in Vilna. So, and it was ge tting to afternoon, Yaffa's father and my brother and three Russian people in a statio nwagon, they're coming in. So, here I run to, it was getting a little darker and I run into the house and I said, what will we do? Did you tell, Tegula(ph), her name was Tegula, did you tell your husband what we are expecting? And she said, you are crazy, go to sleep. You are crazy, go to sleep. Q: This was Yaffa's mother? A: Yeah. Q: And their house was near yours? A: Yes, right, it was our house in the center and theirs wa s like in the corner. And I got very upset with her that she didn't even, she didn't tell him what is going on. And she said , look, here we have protections, we have three soldiers, one was a hi gh ranking soldier and two, I don't know, one was a chauffeur and the other one, and they are sleeping in our house, when we are having our dinner, and we are not afraid. I went home and I talked to my oldest brother an d my oldest brother said, yes, I am agreed that you are crazy. Go to sleep. I said, I am not going to go to sleep. Go to sleep. I said, I am not. So they said, you know what we'll do? We had a two st ory house, we'll put, we'll change guard, all night, one will stay upstairs near the door and watch. And who di d they choose? We had a boy, a young boy, 15 years old that lived with us fr om Vilna. He was not a smart boy, obviously, because three, four years he is without parents an d from one place to anothe r place, and I went to sleep and I dozed off and all of a sudden I hear, my room was downstairs, and I hear like soldier boots are going, they are passing by my window. And I jumped up and ran upstairs and I see a circle of people speaking Polish. I put, I laid down on, they shou ld not see me standing up, I laid down on the balcony and I hear th em, exactly what they were talking. And I started to wake up 54 everybody and nobo dy moving. They say, you are crazy. You imagine things. I said, come out, give a look, they are right in front of our house. Woul d they go to our house? As many people as are here? Nobody would get out alive. Because we wouldn't be able to run, they would surround the house or they, like they did there, th ey throw a grenade. We wouldn't survive. Q: When you heard them talking, what did you hear them saying? A: I didn't, not exactly, but they were debating, they planned to go to our house and they, then they between themselves decided, but then they better go to Sonneson's (ph) house because there are the Russians and they can take their documents and th eir ammunition. And they went there and in no time, we heard a grenade. And then everybody starte d to run. Everybody star ted to run that I even forgot that I have to go with my mother. My brother, I ran out with Petkofski(ph) , one from our home town, he just testified something, too. And we ran, we didn't know wh ere to run, we ran to the gardens and we ran into a ditc h and then another one. The Smar ts(ph) came also to the same ditch, but not knowing where we ar e, if we are there or what, and we were hiding there and not knowing what we are hidi ng, what should we expect , but it came to my mind, my mother. Where is my mother? And, but there was no way to go look back or nothing. In the morning we were sitting there and mice were running on our hat, and we couldn't move, we were sitting there in the ditch. In the morning, we got through the night, we don't know, should we go out, should we sit there? What should we do? We don' t know. We only, I heard shooting, but I didn't know what is going on. Anyway, it came about 8:00 probably, we have to go out, we can't sit, whatever will happen to us will happen. I walked out to the house, it was not too far from the ho use, and I heard screaming. It was her father, crying and screaming. Q: Whose father? A: Yaffa's father. And I said, when we get close to, we were afraid even to give a step someplace, and he said, my Fagalese(ph) is de ad, they shot my wife and the child. And we were begging her all the time, not to pick up the boy. The boy is in good hands, let' s know, we knew we were not secure. We knew it. But we coul dn't believe ourselves that somebody will do us harm. And then he said, I said, I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it. And in no time, we left, we left all, we went to 55 Raddan, stayed there over Shabbas(ph ). And came back, the next day we left to Vilna, I never came back to the town again. My brothers went a couple of times. I never did. We stayed in Vilna until they started to arrest my brother a ll the time to interrogate him. He should tell, they wanted him, he should testify that the Poles did not, that the Poles, a father or something, I couldn't understand what, I really don't, but I know I went, we didn't, and they wa rned us, we had the mayor that came after to our town, I have his name written, advised us not to go any more to the town because we will get killed. So, definite ly, we definitely did not think to retu rn any more. We were in Vilna, but we knew we cannot be an y more on this ground. Q: You found your mother? She came? A: Oh, yes. We got all together and we all left for to leave, to run and then we moved to Vilna. Q: Let me ask you a stup id question. When you heard these soldiers come in, before you started warning everybody, how were you absolutely sure th ey were Polish soldiers? A: I heard them speaking. I didn' t know, I couldn't hear what they are speaking, but I heard them speaking, that they are having a conversation, they were advising each other, should they go to our house, should they go there. Q: And it wasn't Germ an, it was absolutely... A: No, definitely not Germ an, definitely heard Polish and the woman told us. Q: What woman? A: The woman that came in the morning that brought us the laundry, she told us that the White Poles, but I heard them speaking Polish. There was no Germans, that was way past the time from Germans. Q: Were you surprised? Here y ou had survived all of this, you were liberated, you went back to your town, and you were still fighting a war. A: But we had twice that we almost got killed by the Poles. So it was not a surprise either. Because at _________________ house the Poles killed. At _____________ when we were sitting there, when they came they didn't find us, we were lucky. So we knew that they are against us, we knew, but, like we did not believe that the Germans were going to kill everybody, like the doctor said to 56 my mother, you are such a smart woman, Mrs. Kabachik, are you going to tell me that they will kill 4,000 people? That's the same with us, why should they kill us? What did we do wrong? Q: And Yaffa's family was very distraught? A: Yeah, you survive, she had killed, one baby killed, one baby in the ghetto when there was the selection, and she said she will never want to be a killer for another baby. And here, why? What did we have? So whatever we had, they robbed. Whatever we had was left and they robbed it and that's why we knew they would need it because they found the clothes that was left, all the things that was left to us, they found it. They were finding it in the, he was a janitor in their slaughterhouse. He is th e one, he showed me how to go to Corcochan(ph). Q: And he is one of the people who... A: He was, he was involved in that, I don't, I ca nnot tell who shot them, I don't know. But he was also involved in this bunch of people. And that's what we decided, while we are still in Vilna and we wanted to know where did her father disappear? Yaffa was a little baby, my mother wanted to take her. Her uncle didn't give us the children. Because he said, I am the brother, they belong to me. And we, I coul d not speak Russian. I spoke Russian, I understood, but I couldn't. I took my cousin, which spoke a beautiful Russian, and they told us ther e is one mayor, Pukavnik(ph) Straffski(ph), we should go, he is a Jew and he is a very high rank officer, we should go to him and tell him the story and let him help us to find wher e Moishe(ph) Sonneson is. At least to know where he is. So, when I told him the story, he woke up, he was neve r a Jew, but he wo ke up, his heart, with such a killing, he started to cry. He heard the story what had happened in our town, after we got through the war, after we got survived, and why did they do it no w to us? So, I, and he grabbed the telephone and called up the Porkoror(ph) Belehoov(ph), and I heard him talking and telling him the story. And we have to find out where Sonneson is. I did it on my own, Yaffa did not know, nobody knew. And he said, he'll come three days later and I will tell you what we can help you. And we came, I went with my cous in and three days later and he sa id, I am sorry, I am sorry that I'm involved in that, I'm sorry, I'm in trouble. I am in trouble. That, they killed, they killed her because, Moishe put her out to be killed because he wanted to rob the Polish people. And we 57 became very good friends with this Pukavnik, he used to come in to Vilna to our house because we had a piano in the house and he like d music so he used to come to play. And he said there is no place for us. Because there were constantly people got killed on the streets. We never went out in Vilna from the house too far. We were assigned to that room, we were four families in one apartment and never moved out, neve r nothing. And one day he said , run. So we made papers, I and my brother, we couldn't make it to run all together so they were making papers for me and for my brother and got into a cattle train. And we were hiding there with the cattle and we came to Lodsch(ph). Q: How long did you stay in Vilna, do you think? A: Until, from October until March, about four months, maybe, or three months. Q: And you still felt like you were in hiding still. A: Oh, yes. We were all the time in hiding. We were only, this Po lish man used to come to us and his cousin used to come to us in Vilna, but we were never secure. We never knew if tomorrow is another day for us. And then we came to Lodsch and they told us they have a room for us in Lodsch, but we cannot go out on the streets because there is pogrom s every day. So we got into a room and we were waiting for the family to come. Until the family came and then we found out there is an organization that is pulling out all the Jews, we'll go on the way to Israel. That's what we thought. We never knew we'll end up in the United States. We thou ght we are going to be, to go to Israel. Q: How did you know to go to Lodsch? A: There was an organizer, how did we go to go to Lodsch? Q: How did you decide to go there? A: Because we had to run away from Lithuania and that was Poland. Lodsch was Poland. Q: But the White Poles were... A: Yes, but there nobody knows us. And there wa s places where we were assigned to go. We didn't go anyplace to rent our room. There were places where they had assi gned, an accumulation 58 of all the people who were runnin g from Lithuania, from White Ru ssia, that's where they were supposed to be settled. It was organized by Israel. ____________________. Q: So you were told, you we re informed that everybody was heading towards Lodsch? A: Yes. Q: So the problems after liberation were with the Poles and the Lithuanians? A: Yes. Q: Okay. I just want ed to understand that. A: So we came th ere and then one day they said we have to move. We have to go farther, we have to be going closer to where we can go to Israel . We never knew where we are going. There came an order, tonight we are leaving. We packed our packs on our shoulders and th at's all we could take and we are going. Q: Do you know which organizations were helping you? A: There was _______ _______ and we never saw w ho was in charge of it. We never knew what we are doing, we just took, they gave us orders, for example, we got documents that we are Greeks, by the way, and we are coming fr om a camp to go home. So when we came to Czechoslovakia, here we are on a train, we go to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Krakaw, Warsaw, all these towns and we come to Czechoslovakia and there was no commun ication right away so we get off of the train. And the orders was for us, who speaks Hebrew ? Could speak Hebrew _______________, if anybody, Russian soldiers show up, because they were under the occupation of the Russians, should sit down and pray. And if somebody comes to talk to them, they have to pretend they don't hear. They have to pretend they d on't see and who speaks Hebrew, should speak Hebrew between themselves. Here are coming in a few Russian soldiers, we were sitting waiting for a train and he says, who are these clowns? Who are these clowns? And we understand what they are talking and we pretend we don't understand. So he says, well , they show me their documents, they are Greeks, they are going from the camp home, let's go in the town there is a Greek and we will come, we will bring him and he'll find out from them who they are. He'll know how the speak the language. The first best train that came, didn't kn ow where it is going, what it is going, we were on the train, on top 59 of the train, on step of the train, didn't matter if we w ill fall, only to kill ourse lf, no matter what, we were on the train. We come on the train, it gets a little dark and we heard them, what we heard, notified us that we are going to Budapest from there. And we hear coming up that soldiers are there and they are talking to themselves, look, if th ey are coming from a cam p, how come they have backpacks? When they will fall asleep, we'll grab their backpack s and we will throw them down from the train. What do you do? So here we ar e sitting holding each other tight and we are not sleeping when you are sitting like th is on the train. Waiting the nigh t should get over and we should survive the night. We did. And we're coming into Budapest and they pack us, not a car, how do you call it, the communication, it was a streetcar. And they pa ck us and I had a fair cold, a ______________. And I hear one saying, she's coming from camp, how does she have a cold like this? They didn't ha ve in camps this kind of colds. Let's find out who they are. And I whispered the man that I thought he is the leader, I didn't k now for certain but I thou ght maybe. And I said, I have to, the minute that streetcar st ops, I have to get off. And we ha ve to change to another one to run into another one and there they will tell us wher e we have to go. Anyway, they were not one, there were probably several, one remained, the ot her ones jumped off with me and we changed to another streetcar and we came to the camp where we are assigne d. And we never could get out from the camp. That's wh ere we had to stay until we was transf erred. I was luck y. One morning, we were 60 people in a room, slee ping all the way on the floor, no pillows, nothing, whatever we would cover or something. On e woman comes on and she goes a nd looks around and looks and looks and she's, you could see she's an elderly pers on but she's so desperate. So I stopped her, I said, lady, what are you looking? She says, my daughter, they took her away, the Germans and maybe with so many people coming, maybe she will be there among them. And you look so much like her. So, I says, no, I'm not he r. She says, be my daughter, so I said to her, I have my mother here. Anyway, she used to come ev ery day to the camp and she used to take me out. I used to go, take something, I had embroidery a lot, which I used to embroider and I picked it up from hiding places. Used to go to the market with her and we used to sell something, a little something, and we used to bring food in the camp for my mother and in no ti me, they told us to mo ve. We have to go. 60 Q: Where was this camp? A: In Budapest. So agai n, we take the streetcar and we don't kn ow where we are going. We have to go. We are going to the train, that's what he sa id, but nowhere, where we are going, we did not know. Q: And how long do you think you were there? A: We were there about two months probably. Q: In Lodsch you we re there how long? A: Lodsch was so blank to me, Lods ch was really blank to me. Becaus e it was terrible there. So at Budapest at least I went out, I sa w, the first time we saw food, th e first time we saw corn, we can buy a corn to eat. And b ecause otherwise in the camps was just so up and bread. So, I, they pack us on a streetcar and I was the last one, everybody got in and I was st anding on the step holding on to the handles. And I fell back and I remain myself, the street car goes, leaves. And I don't know where to go and I don't know the language and I don't know, I knew just few words that I learned from her. And I don't kno w and it's getting dark. And I got so many stories that people were caught on the street and they were sent to Siberia. Because the Russian soldiers were obviously around there. I only knew that the camp must be like in the back, I have to go ba ck and undid it. Like on the north side of the street is a big building and there is the camp, the camp obviously was always locked, we couldn't go out when we wanted. But I, I don't know how I made it. I don't know. I saw it's getting dark and in Buddah, I was never in Buddah because I knew Buddah is in the mountains and I see lights coming up and it's so beautiful and now life is finished, my life especially is finished. I don't know where to go. Anyway, I took a streetcar and I went and as I went I noticed that camp and I jumped off and I we nt into the camp and I told th em what happened to me and I don't know where they went and I don't know what I can do. Anyway, in the early morning, almost like in the middle of the night, my brother showed up, my oldest brother. My mother came in the station there and she saw I am not there so she st arted to scream and cry, she is not moving any place until they find me. And they did let her, they sa id you have to go. So my oldest brother said, I am going to find her. I'm going to. I'm not going wi th them. And he forced them to take him back 61 to the camp and he found me in the camp. And the ne xt time they did bring us , they brought us to a station and there one of my cousin s got very sick. We had to go past, it was by Yugoslavia because I heard speaking there. In four hours we had to make it to that st ation where we were supposed to meet. People broke their feet, people broke their arms, there was up and down, there was mountains, there was, we made it. We were carrying each other, we were holding on to each other, we made it in four hour s. And my mother, we made it, we came there, but where we were so close together and there they packed us and took us to Italy. We came to Italy, we went to Venice and then we went, very short, I just, barely saw th e birds and the water and they transferred us to Patawa(ph). And from Patawa I remember we were so hungry, we had no food and we went out and we bought a piece of herring, and we didn't s ee herring all the time from the war, and we ate with bread and then they told us they're sending us to near Mila no. Not, now I' m blank, I can't remind myself where it is the camp. Because I got married there. And we were there in a camp with 80 people, who wants to sing in the middle of the night, who wants to get married and fight with their wife every middle of the night, who wants to , and here we are there in the middle. Anyway, by that time, on the last st op, when we came to go to Ital y, this I missed, we were there and my legs were very swollen and my brother alwa ys, he was very tall, he was six foot tall, he liked to hear stories. We were so bitter we didn't want to hear anything, not to see anything, who cares what it is, let the world come to an end already. And he goes out and the tell him and he overhears a story that this and this name, No rman Shulman, Schlemovitch(ph), not Shulman, Schlemovitch, they caught him on the border with so me young people. Everybody ran away, he did not run away because he felt like he is not guilty of anything and he's in jail there. And there's nobody to help him beca use there is no family. Q: I have to stop now. End of tape 7. 62 Tape 8 Q: We stopped, your brother ha d told you that, this Norman... A: Yes. So Norman came to us, I was in bed, and he said to my mother, do you know who is here? Your brother's relative, this and this, and we knew him because we knew the whole family. Because in the town that he was born, my mother had two sisters and a brother. And, of course, we used to go to visit my uncle in Li ptenshoc and we always used to m eet, I used to meet his sister, I used to meet his two sisters, and I knew every one of them we knew. Beca use his mother used to come there on vacation, too. So, we decided, tomorrow morning, we decided, in the prison that he is, is nothing, is just like upstairs, he comes to the window and yo u can talk to him. So the whole family takes, in the morning we go there to see what we can do fo r him, obviously. We come there and he tells us his story, that he is innocent. Ther e were people crossing the border to, on the way, it was from Italy to Germany, I don't even know wh ere the border was. Some were smuggling money in at that time, but he had nothing. He had, he wa s innocent, he just was go ing with them. And they put him, of course, he didn't run away. They ra n away, he didn't run away. And they put him in jail. And, you can save me. You go tomorrow to the authorities of the Ge rmans and tell them that you are my wife, you survived in a camp and I didn't know where he is and he doesn't know where I am. And try to see they should let me out. Because I am, I did not do anything wr ong. So, next, we go there, we come to the office, they told us where to go. And I come to the office and she listens to me and I tell her, but of course, I have to lie. And I was very much afraid. I was shivering. I was so shiver ing that I could not talk . And I said, out to th e secretary, how would you feel when you lose ever ybody, you lose, I lo st, I didn't know where my hu sband is and that's all I want. I want to be reun ited. Please let him out, don't ask me too many questions, I can't answer. And I said, I am really very sick right now and I show her my legs. And my knees were very swollen. So she said, okay, come tomorrow. I come tomorrow and I am shivering, I really shiver. Because I know I'm lying. And she tells me, what date did you get liberated? I didn't know. I didn't know what to say. So I st arted to cry and I said , why are you asking me questions? Did we have a calendar? Do I know where I am? Do I know what I can, what happened to us? We are just 63 lucky by a miracle. We survived. And I found out my husband survived, so that's all I want, just reunite me with him. And she sa id, alright, she told me the date . And she marked down and she said, okay, stop crying. Go home, go to your kin, take care of your legs, we'll let him out. And a few hours later he came. Q: What was the name of this camp in Italy? A: It was, I think, Villa(ph), I think it was Villa. Now, this wasn't in Italy. It was on the border of Italy and Germany. Q: You mean this prison? A: This prison. Q: But your DP camp was... A: The next, then we crossed the bo rder and we went to Italy. We went to Italy together already. We came to Italy and he was with us in camp and then he told my mother that he would like to marry me. And my mother did not want to hear. He had a wife, he had two children that he lost. He's much older than I am. And she did not want, and my brothers did not want. Q: And you? A: And I was very disappointed. I had several boyfriends there. And I was disappointed seeing people, they get married and they fight at night and they divorce ne xt day. And I was afraid for a stranger. So I said, and he was very intelligent, my husband. Very knowle dgeable. I liked this intelligence. I didn't look at anything. I didn't finish stud ying. I didn't, I felt like, I like a person like this. And I said, I would like to marry him. But they said no. And if mother said no, it's no. Anyway, he got mad and he went and picked up hims elf, and we didn't have too much what to carry to move. And he went to Rome. In Rome there was the Macahs(ph), which remains all the organizers of our _____ ________, refugees. And he got an offer. They knew that he knows Hebrew, he was never a teacher, but he knew, whatever he knew he remembered. And they knew it very well. So, he should organi ze the Hebrew schools. Because there is children coming from Hungary, from all over the world, from Russia, everybody of a different language. Children picked up from the war raised by Poles. They would on ly speak Polish. People from all over the world, 64 there is different languages. Ever ybody is waiting. We didn't plan about another way but to get to Israel. But, we had to get illegally to Israel. And we started to get rumors that they are drowning the boats. The boats that leaves to Israel, is illegal, and they are drowni ng a lot of people which were afraid to move, too. Anyway , so they said, you kn ow _______ that you can do it. So, they gave him, and he organized the school. He wa s the only one teacher, he was the only one everything. And he taught everyt hing in Hebrew. Geography, ar ithmetic, he taught, not being a teacher. And, I'll show you the pict ures later from this, from this school. And he organized and it was going very beautifully, but he felt that just teaching is not enough, they have to have acting, they have to have singing, they have to have a little fun, the child ren. They didn't live yet, they didn't have any fun. So there came a friend of his th at he knows, that he was an author, a singer in Warsaw and he also was a Cantor(p h) in Vilna. And he took him in. He said, I' ll teach you the Hebrew, every night wh at you have to teach tomorrow, but you occupy the children in _____________, it means in acting and other things. And he did. And little by little he organized another teacher, another, he had three, four teacher s already. And the school was going beautifully. And it was good, no this is when he started, and then he called me up and he says, oh, we get married, or forget about me and I'll forget about you. Q: Now, you were still where? A: We were still in Kermorna(ph). This, I jumped a little bit. Ahead of time. And I said to mother that, I said, I want him, he shoul d come. And he came and my mother and my brothers were eating. They were going on, we will not let you get married. And I said, I want to marry him, I do. So, anyway, in a couple of days, th ey wrote the invitations, they are to a few people, and we got married. And we left next morn ing to Rome. He had a room near the Vatican, and there were not allowed to be married people there. But since the landlady liked him very much, so she let him stay two weeks with me there. Now we took our nephew with us. He wa s 17 years old, we took him out from the camp. My mother, of course, did not want him to leave. But, we told there is a better life, you will study, he's 17 years old, he has to study, he was caught in the war when he was twelve years old. We have to take him. But, where should we put him. We are not allowed to stay there in 65 the room, so how long, and what we 'll do. So, we used to, we had two beds, we slept, the three of us, and in the morning we used to put him in the closet or in th e ____________ under the door to hide him and then he used to go out during the bell, he just came in to us . Anyway, it came two weeks, we had to move, we found a room to stay. There was no lights, nothing, it was dark all day. No food, the packages we got, they used to eat it up in ab out a week or two weeks. I did not, I lived on bread and food. And then he was tutoring, ____________'s childr en, two boys he had. They came from Lithuania. An d he was the main authority in the Macahs, in the wher e all the workers for the benefit of the Jewi sh refugees is. And he said to him, you know, I' ll pass on the room to you, where I'm living, because I'm getting an apartment. And that was, we had a hope that we are going to start living. He passed on the apartment, one room only. But again, we had our nephew with us. So again, we had to hide him. And he got tired of it, we were, we didn't say anything, I didn't say anything, because that was my mo ther's eyeballs, you know, he's fr om the old family, one. And then he started to, he didn't want to go to his school, to my husband's school. He used to take, go on the streetcars, 17 years old and coming late home and it was very not good. We felt like we had, are not doing justice. So, we decide d, we were in a kibbutz near th e ______________, it's near Rome, and there's a lot of young people, an d they teach him in a different, th ere's no adults, there's more in his age, 17, because Norman's stud ents were young, up to 12, 13, not 17. And we decided, and he agreed with us, he will go to this kibbutz with the young people. And he left just like this, and I told him, in the daytime I will wash your clothes, what we had there. And we'll bring it to him tomorrow morning, I'll go at the wash yard and I will it to him. That night they surrounded camp and they took out all the young people and they put them on a boat and they sent th em to Israel illegally. And when my mother found out that he is sent to Israel illegally, I thought that's the end of my life. She would never forg ive me. She was giving on like I would take the life away from her. It happened a miracle, to make it short. And David _____ _____________. They had returned the boat and they didn't harm them, but th ey returned the boat, not to Naples, near Naples was a port and we found out they returned the boat. And of co urse, promptly my mother and one of my brothers and I and my husband and we are running there to get him of f the boat. At that time we 66 found out that my husband, my husband knew he has a brother in the United States . He knew he has a brother in Argentina. But he did not know the addresses, did not know where they lived. But he put a ad in the paper and he thought ______ _________. And he ask, he wrote his name, that Norman Kabachik is looking for hi s brother and this. His brother did not read the Jewish Press already, but one of, an old lady from his town read it and she ca me, she knew his brother and came early in the morning. Knocked on the door and she said, hurry, hurry, you have a brother who is alive. And he was the youngest. His brother, hi s mother birthed 16 childre n, some never lived, they died at birth, but he was the youngest, he was the second from the youngest, the youngest was a sister. His name is Norman and he is in Italy an d she gave him the address and everything. And we got right away, a telegram and $50. So here we have $50. We pick up the $50 and we go to take him off of the ship. And my mother there, we come there, and he said, no, I'm not getting off. You are waiting to get to Israel, you d on't know where, we didn't plan to go to the United States at that time. And we just got through hell , we did not have no fo od, no water for three days. I used to turn out, he showed us how he turned out his pocket and looked for a cr umb. And people were dead on the, a couple of people on the trip. And I have the certificate to get in legally to Israel now, they gave them, and I can take 8,000 liras for it if I want to sell it. I don't want the money, I want to go to Israel. We can get in legally. You said to us, y ou may have to get through the same way he just got through. And I don't want to go th rough over again, that. And I'm goi ng. We took out the $50, we gave him, and I bought him some cl othes to change. And they left to Israel. So he did remain in Israel and we already got in touch with his brothe r and his brother sent us right away papers. But there was a toss up, the Argentina br other wanted us to come and this wanted us to come. But he had chosen the United States. And that's what, it didn't , it wasn't easy to come. Q: Now, when did you come over here? To the United States? A: We came here in 1948. March, 1948. Q: So you were in Italy about two years? A: More than two years, over tw o years, almost three years. Q: Mostly in Rome? 67 A: Rome. Q: In this camp, Kromona(ph), you were not there so long? A: No. No, we were just there ab out two or three months, maybe. Until I decided I am not going to listen to the family. Q: I just want to ask you real qui ckly, because this is, I'm going to let you continue. But this camp Kromona, were there only Jewish refugees there? A: Yes, in Kramona were only Jewish. Q: Was it okay there? Was it decent? A: There was about 80 pe ople in the room, a lot of quarrels, a lot scream ing, a lot of uncomfortable things. The kitchen was still only soup and bread, but we had, my brothers knew how to make leather. So they found, they got in contact with some people that they wanted to learn how to make leather. And they worked with them, they were teac hing them, so they started to have some money. Q: Was the camp, were you sealed in, or could you co me and go as you wanted? A: We could come, in It aly we could come and go. No problem . Italy, we learned to be free. When I came to Italy, to Rome, in Kromona we weren't that much going out. Going out sometimes to buy a piece of fruit or somethin g. But when I came to Rome, a nd I used to go onto the street and you know the Italian how they spea k with their hands and they scream ? I used to get frightened and run home right away and come to my landlady and tell her that people were, I saw people fighting and I was very much afraid. And she taught me how to free, she sa id, you have to learn how to be free, it's free. They are not fighting, they are talkin g like this. That's the way Italians talk. That's the way, once the DP, the MP, were looking for so mebody and they knocked on our room at night in our house. And they came in, th ey were just looking for a certain, I don't know what. I fell out of bed when I saw a man, somebody in a uniform. I got so hysterical th at I thought, we ll, this is the end of us. I couldn't, unti l now, I can't, I can't cope with uniformed people. Q: How long did it take y ou to feel somewh at comfortable? Somewhat safe? A: Until we came to the United States. I lived with my sister-in-law and lived, they picked us up from the station, we came by train from New York. But we started to feel we are free. And we, at 68 that time we didn't have locked wi ndows, we didn't have locked doors. We weren't afraid to go at night. We had no car. My husband got a job. We thought he will be a teacher, but he said he is not going to be a teacher. He doesn't wa nt to leave, to remain a teacher. He'll remain a te acher, he said, I'll teach, I'll have my cellar, that's it, I want to do something in a hurry that we can go on living like everybody is living. They have a car, they have a ho me. The dream to have your own home, you know what it is? To have, maybe a car, I didn't dream to have a car. But, maybe to have a car. My niece and nephew, Norman 's brother's two children, they lived very close to us and I could walk to them. I used to go in the daytime to one niece and the other, then I started to help my niece, my niece was very sick, so I was helping her with her baby, she had a year old baby. And I was pregnant with my daughter at that time. And I us ed to help her, but everything was just in the mind to dream, someday, maybe. I did not, I was a pessimist. I didn' t think we would ever, I didn't think, I didn't, but my husband had a feel to get out and accomplish what people did in the, when they were young, he has to do it in a hurry. And that's why he said, I am not going to be a teacher. And the children were very disappointed. Because they, and I wanted, because the atmosphere, the friends would be different. When we go in business, _____________ and have to learn the language. My husband picked up the language very easily. Not, first thing he started school right away. I couldn't. I, and he had, he comes from a fa mily that language is ____________ to him, it's easy, very easy. He went less than a year and th e teacher wanted to give him a diploma that he finished high school. But he wasn 't interested in the papers or so mething, as long as he can go on working and get out on our own, not to live with my sister-in-law because we lived with her. And she did not have any children and here I am pregna nt and I have a baby and her mother used to say, why don't you give the ba by to my daughter, you're young, you'll have a nother one. And I was frightened for it. Becau se she has a home, she has everything. I have nothing. And how can I be secure that I won't have to give up my baby? So we wanted, and we couldn't fi nd a place to rent. It was impossible in '49, '48, '49, to find a place to rent. Until, luckily, we found a little house in the east of Los Angeles and I moved out. And we started our life on our own. Q: So you're, th e brother lived in Los Angeles? 69 A: Yes. Q: And you took the tr ain from New York? A: But, his brother died in December. And they did not tell us. The sister-in-law wanted so badly, and the children, that we should come, that they decided they will not tell us. We got, I probably was the only on the ship that we got a telegram that my sister-in-law wrote in the telegram, she'll be the happiest woman in the United States when we will come there. And did not tell us that he is not here. So, obviously, this is what was, we were , wanted to do. And we came and he was dead already three months. He died in December, we came in March. And that was a big disappointment for my husband. Because we could have gone to Argentina and have the brother. That's all he wanted, to have a br other, from such a fa mily. So, but, we stepped forward, we didn't look for the, we didn't l ook back. We were, we would do everyt hing, any way at a job and then he got fired from the job because he was planning to go in business with somebody and, again, was no money to live on. We were offered help, but we would not accept. We lived on $25 a month, paying rent and everything and a new child. And doctors and dentists and we made it. I don't know. We made it. We moved out from Los Angeles. We met a woman. After he was fired and he was looking to go to business, in business, we met a woman that she worked for his brother. And everybody that knew his brothe r was crazy about him. Nothing but praises. And she said, I have a very hard time living here because we worked, we opened stor es and we got broke, if you are planning to go in business, try a small town. And she offered where they just opened a business. And I, as we were talking to her, I said, Mary , I can't see myself, where do I have to go, I have nobody. At least my husband has a niece and a nephew, which they loved me dearly, they would do everything for me. But I have here nobody. She said, Miriam, she looked up at me, she says, Miriam, from now you are my sister . You are my adopted sister. And she was. She was my sister all the way until she died. As a matter of fact, it was this night I dr eamed about her. They were so devoted when my husband was sick. We didn't have a car, we lived in Los Angeles yet. And they, we used to drive with them, they had a truck, we used to drive in the truck with them to Monrovia(ph) every day. They, they guided us, and then we wanted to rent a house in Monrovia, I 70 had two children already and we co uldn't, they wouldn't rent two children a house. So we were driving, first was the rent. My mo ther was in Brazil, she went to the brothers to Brazil from me to live. And I was pregnant, I had a lot of problem with sw elling in my hands and my feet. And we felt if my mother would come, she could help me, not to use so much water, and I would be able to help my brother, my husband because he was op ening a business in Monrovi a where she advised. And then I would go help him, not knowing anything about that . And we moved to Monrovia, we finally found a house that he wanted to buy and I we nt to see it and I said, I can't move to the house, my mother was too old, and I said, my mother wouldn't be able to straighten out. She has to go _____________, because th ere was something, $8,000, and I said, I can't do that to my mother. We'll live in the east of Los Angeles near the temp le, she'll go Saturday to the temple, she speaks Yiddish there, she never learned En glish, what will I do to her? I cannot do it to her. Anyway, then my sister-in-law came to visit us one day and I said, come on, I want to show what my husband wants to do to my mother. To bu y a house like this. So, she went with us and she says, because this was without a down payment we could buy. And sh e says, do you see anything else? I says, yes, today the real estate man showed me a house, bu t we need $3,000 down pa yment and I don't want my niece, they could give us, becau se they gave us some money for the store to open, but we paid them right back. And she said to me, so I said, I don't have the down payment. She says, here is $3,000, go buy the house. I said, in January, this was in the beginning of September, you'll have it back. End of tape 8. 71 Tape 9 A: So, we bought the house and it was near a school, of course , and I started to work in stores because my mother was with me an d she was taking care of the childr en. But they were driving me crazy. My mother should leave because she came on a visit from Brazil. And this was a big tragedy to me if my mother is to live. Because my mother wanted to live with me. Even she has there the two sons and the sons were very good to my mother. Very good. But she wanted to live with me, not to go back to Brazil. The life there was terrible when they came in. The snakes used to come in, they lived in a hous e there was no windows, the snakes used to come into the house. And the mosquitoes and the, and th en, so, she didn't. We worked ve ry hard and we couldn't make her stay, so she went to New York and one of my cousins introduced her to a rabbi and he married her. And I could not go see her because I didn't have the money, but a friend of mine was coming from Israel to Los Angeles and she stopped to see her, and she came in and she says to me, Mirali(ph), you must borrow money and go see how your mother lives. Queen Elizabeth doesn't have this respect what your mother has from that rabbi. He worshi ps every step she gives and every place she sits down. You mu st. But I didn't borrow. And, unfortun ately, less than a year, he died in his sleep. So then sh e came back to me. And she liv ed with me. Q: So you built up a life in Southern California. You had two children. A: I had two children. Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions. In coming to this country, was it difficult to begin a new life? A: It was difficult. There was di fficult, not speaking English. Lucky that one of my nieces spoke Hebrew a little because her mother was a Hebrew pr incipal here when they came. And I was very well liked in the family. So there was, I would say, I shouldn't say there was, I was still lucky. Lucky. Because a lot of people came and they had problems to adjust well with this. We adjusted beautifully with our relatives. And they were trying to be very nice. In American way. Ours was different, but we could go on until we started on our own. 72 Q: Well, other than the language, what was the most difficult for y ou? Was there sort of a culture shock? A: No, I'll tell you, they di d. We came from the tr ain today, and next morning I got up to my sister, Laura(ph), and I said, look, I realize we are comi ng from a different country, different culture, different upbringing. I want you to teach me. I want you to make a remark whatever I do wrong. I want you to teach me how to help you because you are just a widow a few months . How to help you, how to help some body that needs my help, a nd teach me. Don't be afraid to tell me anything. I'll take everything what you tell me. She took me around, she ki ssed me, and she says, I would never believe that I can have a sister-in-law like you. She said, this is what I will do. I will be with you. But, there was a big differe nce, as it was going on, because she wanted to remarry. And we felt uncomfortable. We wanted to get out and here we couldn't get a place. But, as it was going on, it developed that we had our own place and we, th en we have the children and we moved away. And we became, we were friends a ll the time. We were friends. Th ere were some things that we were a little, always said in her heart, but she did not do certain things. But we never brought it up. Whatever she did was wonderful for us. Q: How long did it take you to stop thinking about all that you had been through? A: Because I was very busy. I worked in the store from eight until, sometime s until 10:00 at night. We did not go to restaurants to eat. We cooked. And I was a very clean housekeeper so there was a lot of work at home. My mother started to get ill, so I was busy with her very much. There was no time to think. This is a big __ ______________, no time. But, if I, when we brought the Polish man to the United States, I could not speak for two week s. I was, I couldn't, I could not speak a word Polish. I felt ba d. Well, I still cannot speak Polish. And I just, I did not know what to do. I didn't. We were two weeks, thank God w ith my husband and my cousin, __ __________. He and his wife, they were accepted, we picked them up from the train, they brou ght him to his house and people started to call us to help and we signed up to the Congress of the Polish Surviv ors and they did a lot to help me with him. To take him out, he wa s honored in Temple, ther e was 1,500 people. We were invited by Fox Studio to ______ _______, and then to give a tour of Fox Studio. And we were 73 invited by a writer, Brown, in Pacifi c Palisade and took us out. And everybody tried to be nice and help him. It was before the parade in Pasadena, the Jewish Agency sent us tickets that we should have a place to take him because they have places . He had, he could have a lot more honor here. Why I was so afraid for him, I don't know. I was so overprot ective of him that I did, I was afraid to let him go in public places. Everyone that called us, I used to investigate like, who he is, what he's, God forbid somebody would not do so mething to him. That was a ve ry big mistake for me. But he had a good time here. He had, we took him to Disneyland and my niece bought him, everybody bought him beautiful presents and he used to get up, things he never saw in his life. ___________________, they gave him a silver cup and he said, what do I do? And my niece bought him a watch. So he got up in the morning like a baby play with a doll, that's how he played with that watch. And we bought him a car. And we bought him a tractor here. And clothes and he was in ___________ ___, we took parties, we we re to a New Year's party t ogether with him. And it was wonderful. But then he said, he want to go to New York. Because he had the saloms(ph) which survive from him, and he had Yaffa. And he went to New York. They were not stupid like I am. They won't overprotect. They took him, the mayor gave him the key of the town and he was on television and he was all over. He could have been here, too. I didn't, I wa s afraid to let him do it. Q: Did you quickly resume y our observance of religion? A: Yes. It was hard for me be cause since I come from an orthod ox family. And there the temple was conservative. So, when you have to driv e to the temple, God, how can you drive on Shabatza(ph)? So, because I used to walk to the store, I worked, but I would walk to the store. So, my mother used to stay near the temple and go there to the temple. And little by little, once the cousin, the rabbi got sick on Yontif(ph). An d my husband used to go to the temple. And I stayed home. Prayed in the house. So, my mother, after Yont if, my mother comes and she says to me, _____________, the rabbi did not show up and they asked your husband to conduct the services. And everybody just hung on me, co ngratulating me, what a wonderful service they had. They never had heard something like it. An d how lucky she has such a son-in-law. So my mother came home 74 and she said to me, you have to start going to the temple and se e a man that he had made up his mind that if he will survive, he is going deep in Russia, he wi ll never observe Judaism. He doesn't want anybody to know that he is a Jew. And he'll never, he wants to be lost. And look what had happened. So little by little, I started to go to the temple, to drive the temple, and we became members. And we had, of course, the money to help. My husband was 20 years a treasurer in temple. And we build a temple. We brought the corn erstone from Israel for the new temple. Q: Something that I'm always curious about. Y ou went through so much difficulty and trauma because you were Jewish. Some people like the man who went into Russia, probably decided they didn't want to be Jewi sh any more. For you this was important? A: For me it was important. And our children, from the first possibility they co uld do, were brought up in Camp ________ ___, for example the year th at my mother died, I t hought I cannot send them to Camp ___________ , we did not have the money. Becaus e the hospital and the burial and the debt of my mother was absolu tely outrageous for me. I didn't think I can cope with it. Q: What year was that? A: 1961. And the rabbi came to visit us and my brothers flew in from Brazil and he asked me, are the children going to camp? And I said to the rabbi, I don't know wh at to tell you. Right now, I can't send them, but I'll see. And he said, I'll see ____________, don't keep them away because they wanted, they wanted, they liked to learn. Q: Why was religion so important to you? Or why is it, I should say. A: We didn't know any other wa y. And because we suffered, be cause we suffered, I was once in the hospital after surgery in, it wa s in Glendora(ph), it was run by nu ns. And once, they always had a priest there, and he came and he started to talk to me. You su ffered so much, I understand, why don't you become a Cat holic and you won't have every to suffer from religion. And I said, something about it, the more you become strong about the religion. We ar e brought up this way and I like the religion and I want to be, I want to remain this. He used to come every day to talk to me. 75 Q: Let me ask you one more ques tion. Clearly, having gone through this, impacted you later on. How you lived your life, your values, maybe how you raised your children. Can you talk about that a little bit? A: Yeah. I could. The minute we used to, my mother said one thing, the minute you'll make for a trip, first thing you go see the br others how they live in Brazil. Because she felt always sorry that here we have a nice, very modest home, very modest. Because we di dn't look for anything, we just looked, we had to support my nephew in Israel because he was by himself. And he did need support. And we felt like nothing means to us but to educate the children about Judaism and to learn Hebrew and even my husba nd was teaching them Hebrew at night. But they did not have enough respect to study with him. So they used to fall asleep on the table because it didn't, it's better to play football than to st udy. But we took a Hebrew teacher from Israel that he us ed to come twice a week and teach them He brew. And we started, as they got older, of course, first was Camp _________, and then we started to send them _ ________ to Israel. And then when my daughter, where she went to school there was two and a half Jews. For under 50 children graduated, there was only this couple of Jewish children. I always used to tell her about to be aware that she will have to marry a Jew. She cannot intermarry. And it came to high school, the graduation, she had to go to overnight parties and she wa nted to go. And she got some boys there that she brought home and she gave them Jewish names and she comes in and she introduces me, they are Jewish, and I, this is Paul and this is this and this is this and I said, what's their last name? And she says, ____________, I know it smart, she' s read it all in the newspaper. I know this . She says, mother, I want to go, I don't want to miss this fun and I'm going with one. So and then, the other parties she used to bring some from the temple, some of the boys. And she went, and then when she got married, she moved to Ne w York. And her children, she started to bring up in the schuls(ph), in Hebrew schools. Q: You mentioned that, you know, you see somebody in uniform even today, and it alarms you. Are there other things like that that bring back these memories? 76 A: I always see the Poles standing in front of my hou se. I see it all the time. Day and night. This does not go away from me. I see the German when he came and I to ok off my watch. I see the day that I was sent out to hide by myself, because it seems like I wa s with my mother or with my brother, one of them, be cause we were always in different places, but I had so mebody with me. And I that, as I said, in Italy, when my landlady used to teach us to be free, not to be afraid, but it still was a fear for us. Very much. But I thought, United States, in this time that we came is so lucky, I was sure that ___________ are dying from hunger because nobody drinks here. Nobody steals here. We used to go to my niece, walk, 12 :00 at night, 11:00 at night, in the middle of day, whenever we used to walk between the two niec es, the niece and nephew and where we lived on Sawyer(ph) Street, and we want to ________. We used to walk out, __ __________ walk in the middle of the night. Ro bertson(ph) Boulevard wasn't built yet. We we re only two houses, on Sawyer Street, Beverlywood(ph) was not built yet. And we want to _____, we were free. Q: Let me ask you one more question. Certain values that you learned as a child from your mother, they really stick with you and, not only may they help you throug h all of this, it was the way you lived after you were free? Certain things that are important to you? A: Giving. Help people. To hel p. And it was upon a time that when we survived, that I said, I will never help people. Because from certain people, wh ich I don't want to mention, we did not, we had a little disappointment. And, but, if you learn it at home from ch ildhood, it won't go away from you. I love to help people. And I love to do for people. And I'm known here in the building. That's why it helps me now to pull through the debt of my husband. I have here family, some have moved away, they went to retirement places. But I am like the sister, some says I'm their mother, some tell me I am their doctor. I am, I live very close to the people and I love people. I cannot leave to see to one evening that I would get crazy. After my husba nd died, I could no t sit down at a table and eat. I used to stand at the sink and eat, Friday night especially. But if my neighbors went to temple, I was called to come. I was welcome to come there a nd eat with them, but I didn't want. I said I have to learn to live by myself. And, but to go, anybody that calls me, anybody they says, 77 I'm going, and they think about me and they care about me. This is the whole idea, they care about me. Q: What year did your husband die? A: In 1992. Four years, on the Fourth of July. Q: When you came over here, did you op enly talk about your experiences? A: Not too much. I talk now more than I used to. Now if we come together, we always find a way to talk about survival. Unless my friend is up here. And tell them things. And everybody is interested. It's funny. Everybody wants to know. It's not, th ey are not running away because I tell them. And I found it necessary that they should know because a lot of people are telling me that we lived here and we didn't know wh at you got through. We didn't know what wa s going on in this world. We were busy, we had small children, we were busy and we never knew what was going on in Europe. We didn't know about the war that much. So this is important that they should know. And it's nothing to be ashamed, we didn't choose it. This is the idea. And my ch ildren want to know about it. And my grandchildren. Q: Was it easy to tell them about it? A: In the beginning it wasn't easy. But later on we did. But we still, I don't think we told them everything. I don't think we told them everythin g. Because my husband always used to see, he said, I was locked up in a building and I saw the way they put my wife and children on the truck. Now, I did get this, true. But I, because when my sister got killed we were in very big danger, so we didn't grieve even as much, because we knew that we are going to be killed, too. Didn't think any other way. But he always said it in his, and he always was screaming at night. I, I don't think there was a night when I didn't have to wa ke him up, Norman, wh y are you screaming? Q: For many years? A: For many, many years. For ma ny years. It never went away fr om him. Because he saw things that, we maybe were scared, but he saw it, he saw it. There was shooting in front of him, they were shooting people. And even in the Partisans, being one Jew that he could have been killed. He was one Jew in the Russian army. 78 Q: You've been very gracious with your time. Is there anything el se you want to add and then we'll finish? A: No more wars. No more wars . But the Polish know that they did contribute a lot to our agony and killing and everything. They did. They should not say that they did not. Not 100%, but a very small percentage. When the Poli sh man came to us, I went into a ______ once with him and he said, see, they tell that Polish people did not help. Here, he himself said, maybe one or two percent, maybe less. This is sad because we lived with them and we coul d live in harmony and everything. This is a deep, why? Why? Becaus e we were born Je ws? So, that's... Q: Thank you. Conclusion of interview.
