AL JAFFEE May 21, 2016 Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Allan Jaffee, on May 21st, 2016, in Manhattan, New York . Thank you very much Mr. Jaffee, for agreeing to meet with us today, to share part of your story, to let us into a world that is no longer there, and in this way to kind of leave for the future, a picture of what once was. We much appreciate it. Answer: Well, I™m very happy to do this for the Holocaust Museum. Q: Thank you. I™m going to start with the most basic questions, and we™ll take the story from there. So please tell me Œ can you tell me the date of your birth? A: 3-13-21. Q: So that would have been May 13 th, 1921? A: March. Q: March 13th. A: March 13th, 1921, yes. Q: ™21. And where were you born? A: I was born in Savannah , Georgia . Q: And what was your name at birth? A: At birth my name was Abraham Jaffee. Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about how it came to be that you were born in Savannah, Georgia . Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 4A: The reason I was born in Savannah , Georgia was that there was a Œ a pawn shop in Savannah that was operated by a Œ a Œ an elderly Jewish man, and he wanted to have somebody take over for hi m in the Œ you know, the daily duties. So he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple down to Savannah and get them lodging, if the Œ the man in the family would take over the running of the pawn shop. And he interviewed my father, and he felt my father was qualified, and my father had recently been married to my mother, who came over from Lithuania to Œ I think she was encouraged to come over to meet my father, but I wasn™t there, so I don™t know anything about that. Anyway, they did get married and go Œ and went down to Savannah , and s-so that™s where I was born, and my three younger siblings were bo rn there, too. Eventually the pawn shop turned into a large department store, and my father became the manager of the department store. Q: Ah, I see. A: And i Œ the Œ you know, and our life in Savannah was quite interesting and exciting. As a young child, I remember adventures in Savannah that Œ that I really cherish. Q: Well, I™m going to get Œ want to explor e some of those, but right now I™d like to talk a little bit more about your immediate family. You anticipated one of my Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 5questions, which is, did you have any sib lings. And so you did, and it sounds like you were the oldest of the Œ of the children. A: Yes, I had three siblings, and I was the oldest, and sadly I™ve outlived them all. Q: Oh dear. A: It™s Œ some of them died fairly young. Two of them actually contracted illnesses in Lithuania during the very severe winters that we experienced there. One of them had spinal meningitis, which Œ Q: Wow, wow. A: Œ did not affect his life, other than it wa s a great shock to us to find out that Œhe was just a little baby Œ well, not a baby, but he was about two years old, or so, and Œ or three. And after he Œ he recovered from the spinal meningitis, we discovered that he could no longer hear anything. So he became a deaf mute. But he Œ he Œ Q: What was his name? A: Bernard. Q: And when was he born? A: You know, I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: I Œ I don™t know the birthdays of anybody. Q: Okay. That™s okay. I ask, but if it Œ and if it™s there, it™s fine Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 6A: Yeah. Q: Œ and if it™s not Œ it™s just to Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ it™s just to get a sense of Œ A: Yeah,, I wish I knew all these things, but since our family was pretty much broken up with all the trips back and forth, and my father losing his job as Œ as a consequence of these interruptions in our liv es, we didn™t have family affairs like birthday parties, and Œ and ce lebrations. I mean, it was just get what you could get out of life, you know, so th at™s why I don™t Œ I really don™t Œ I Œ I never put much store in anyone remembering my birthday, or Œ or me remembering theirs. In any case, he did Œ he did grow up as a deaf mute, and worked, and had a family, and had a Œ a reasonably successful life. My brother David, the youngest, was actually spirited out of Lithuania as the Nazis were invading. Q: We™ll come to that. Right now I just Œ I™m sorry that I interrupt. A: Yes, that™s all right. Q: But right now what I want to get a sense of is just who you r family Œ the names of the people, a little bit about your pa rents and so on. So when we come to chronologically, let™s say 1939, 1941 Œ A: Yes. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 7Q: Œ things like that, then we Œ we™ll explore some of these important parts of their lives. A: I understand. Q: Okay. A: Yes. Q: So right now we have y ou as the oldest, then who was the next brother in line? A: Harry . Q: Harry . And then Œ A: Bernard Œ Q: Bernard. A: Œ and David . Q: Okay, and how many years were ther e between you? I mean, were you very much an older brother, or were they close to you in age? A: We were approximately Œ we Œ each on e of us was separated from the next one by a year and a half. Q: Wow, close. A: Yes. Q: Pretty close. A: Very close. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 8Q: Yeah. Tell me Œ A: And I suspect that my mother took us all to Lithuania so she wouldn™t become pregnant again. Q: That™s a rather drastic trip, you know, a lot of distance. A: Well, my father stayed in America , so Œ Q: Yeah. Well, we™ll come to that. But let™s now stop with your Œ no, not stop, but turn to your mother and you r father. Tell me your mother™s full name and maiden name, if Œ if you have it. What was her first name, and her Œ yeah. A: Her first name was Œ the English version was Mildred. In Œ i-in the Œ in Jewish it was Miechla(ph). Q: Miechla(ph), mm-hm. A: Yeah, but it became Mildred in Œ in Œ in English. My father™s name was Moishe, but which became Morris, and Œ Q: Were they first generation immigrants to the United States? Had they Œ A: Yes, they were. Q: Okay. A: First to general Œ first generation. Q: And where did your fa Œ yo u said your mother came from Lithuania . Where did your father come from? Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 9A: The same town they Œ as a matter of fact, it was at my father™s urging that my mother™s sister, who was here in America, negotiated to have my mother brought over for my father. Q: Oh, as a potential bride? A: Yes. Q: I see, I see. A: They may have had contact in Zarasai . I™m not sure, because eventually our family got so separated, that with all the trips and spending time first with both parents, then with one parent, you know, you lose a lot of Œ Q: Yeah, of course. It sounds like chaos. A: Yeah. Q: So y Œ both parents are from Lithuania , from the same town. A: Yes. Q: They™ve come over to the United States, your father first. Did he have siblings, by the way, your father? Did he come from a larger family? A: Yes, he came from a large family, and curiously, considering what I mentioned earlier, as just an observation, my father was very angry at his father, because he Œ his Œ his mother was pregnant all the tim e, and he had a Œ a large number of siblings. So, it™s ironic in a way that I Œ I think that maybe my mother felt the way Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 10he felt. But i-it wa Œ it was really not unco-uncommon at Œ in those days for large families Œ Q: Absolutely. A: Œ to grow and grow and grow. And of course my father loved his mother so much that she Œ she started to become sickly with all the work attendant to having lots of children, that I think he felt like that Œ that Œ like, you know, a lot of children felt, that as they got more and more siblings, and their mothers were being Œ Q: Worn down. A: Œ worn out Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ they worried about that. Q: Of course. A: So Œ but my mother™s family, there were a lot of siblings also. Some remained in Lithuania , and some went to Russia, and two of them Œ two of my mother™s siblings went to Russia and became doctors. So Œ Q: In the tsarist times? During the tsarist regime? A: No, it was Œ it was probably the Soviet. Q: Okay. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 11A: Yeah, because during the tsarist regime, everyone was fleeing, I d Œ from what I™ve heard, and I Œ I have no reason to know whether it™s true or not. They mainly feared being in the tsarist military, and being sent to fight in Japan, or some Œ you know, strange place in the world. So tha-that was the reason why a l Œ a lot of young Jews took off and emigrated. So Œ Q: It™s a reason I also heard. Nobody wanted to fight in the tsarist army, you know. A: That™s it. Q: Nobody wanted to Œ particularly as it wasn™t their home and their fight. A: Yes. Q: Did your family always come from this part of the world? I mean, this is the [indecipherable] settlement, and a lot of Jews weren™t allowed to live in other places of the Russian empire. Do you know anything beyond th-the stories and the lives of your grandparents, of where they ca Œ their families came from, or does it pretty much start from there? A: I don™t know a-a Œ I don™t know where my grandparents came from. Q: Okay. A: I Œ the only rumors that I heard as a child was that they Œ when they could, they escaped to Lithuania , and in fact, Lithuania is surrounded by lakes, and one of the thrilling stories that we cousins would talk about was that our various parents spent Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 12nights in the lakes, breathing through straws to avoid being recaptured by the Russian military people who were looking for Œ for the young men. So Œ Q: Can we cut for a second. [break] Rolling? We™re rolling. Okay. So Œ so Zarasai was surrounded by lakes, and you heard stor ies and rumors of some of the relatives staying underneath Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ breathing through straws, to not be captured. A: That™s Œ that Œ that™s Œ those are the stories I™ve heard when I was in Lithuania, and of course to me, these were very brave people with great adventures. And I was caught up in it, I Œ you know, as Œ Q: Of course, there™s great Œ they™re grand stories, and it™s very dramatic. A: Yes. And survival was really Œ you kn ow, was a daily business. Whether it was a shortage of food, or Œ or you™re being persecuted by one group or another. My cousin Daniel, who is my age, and was very brig ht, he was so happy about the fact that Japan defeated tsarist troops. Oh, he celeb rated, he had little soldiers, and he would play the Japanese knocking over the Russians. For some reason, tsarist Russia was very unpopular in th e circles that I was in Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ which was predominantly Jewish. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 13Q: Of course. A: Not all Œ not a hundred percent. My Œ my father figure was a Polish man. Q: That™s Zarasai , yes? A: Pardon? Q: That™s when you™re in Zarasai ? A: When I was in Zarasai , yes. Q: Hold that thought. A: Okay. Q: We™ll get there. Right now though, I wa nt to find more out Œ more about your parents, as personalities. What kind of a person was your father, what kind of a person was your mother? Can you tell me that, can you talk to me about that? A: I ca Œ I can tell you as much as I know about my parents, which is, considering our frequent separations, is limited. One thi ng I can tell you for certain is that both my parents had amazing senses of humor. Un fortunately, they didn™t deploy it all the time, because they were in a certain Œ in certain areas of conflict. My father disdained the religious community, my mo ther embraced it. So there was a Œ Q: Tension. A: Œ there Œ and of course, when my fath er took me and my brothers out on a weekend trolley ride to some amusement park, he would buy us hot dogs, and he Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 14would say, do not tell your mo ther. You know, these were not kosher hot dogs. So Œ but as far as humor is concerned, my mo ther, when Œ when we Œ when we visited Lithuania , and I met her relatives, and friends of hers when she was a young girl, and they would say, oh, your mother, the greatest entertainer in the world. She could mimic people, and she could do skits about the tsar and the tsarina and Œ and e-everyone was rolling on th e floor with laughter. Q: Is this a mother you knew? Did you recognize that? A: I Œ I Œ yes, she was very creative, and she was also very in telligent. I mean, she went to night school in America as soon as she arrived, to learn English. And she became so proficient at it, that she collected books, and she would read to us every night to go Œ when we were going to sleep. Q: In English? A: In English. And even when we were in Lithuania, every day sh Œ almost, she would come to me and say, write to your father and tell him to send English books, because you need to keep up with your English. And she constantly corrected our grammar. Q: Wow. A: I can remember so vividly, her look gl aring at me and saying, who is her? You refer to me as your mother, not as her, or she. I mean, she Œ she was a stickler for Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 15Q: Propriety, and Œ A: Œ correctness. Q: Œ yes, yeah. A: And it™s Œ it™s Œ has served me well, beca use I™ve written tons of material myself, and I Œ you know, I Œ I think I learned to speak properly because of her. When I returned from Lithuania, and they stuck me into classes that were younger than th Œ Q: [indecipherable] A: Œ where the people were younger, I was skipped frequently, because I knew Œ I knew the stuff. My mother Œ Q: She made sure you didn™t lose the language. A: Absolutely. Read w onderful stories to us from English books. Q: Now, at home in Savannah , that begs this question of what was the language you spoke to one another in? If English was something that was special, does that mean you spoke another language with one another? A: No, we spoke English en-entirely. Q: No Yiddish? A: No Yiddish whatsoever. Wh en I Œ when we landed in Lithuania , it was first yi Œ I did hear some Yiddish. We had an Œ an elderly Œ not my aunt, but my mother™s Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 16aunt, and my mother would talk to her in Yiddish, and my Aunt Frieda would talk to my mother in Yiddish if she didn™t want us to understand what she was saying. So I heard Yiddish. I had no idea what it Œ any of Œ anything meant, except maybe a few simple words. Bu t when I arrived in Lithuania I knew none of it, and Œ but I learned to speak it fluently. Q: Okay. Now tell me a little bit about your dad. You said he also had a sense of humor, but he had a different value. He was not religious, whereas your mother was religious. A: Yes. Q: What kind of a personality did he have? What do you remember from that? A: He Œ he was Œ I met people in Lithuania who would, when they heard who I was, and they remember going to school w ith my father would say, oh, your father was the smartest guy in the classroom. He also was Œ he became a well-known calligrapher. He could write a s Œ a Spencerian hand, that was Œ people used to ask him to fill out papers for them. Q: Wow, mm-hm. A: All self-taught. And he was an avaricious reader, but of newspapers Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and magazines. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 17Q: What were the newspapers in your home in Savannah? What were the newspapers that he would read? A: Well, there was a local paper Œ papers, but I Œ I don™t remember the Œ the names of the papers. My only interest in those papers were the Sunday funnies, and the daily funnies as well. My brother Harry and I were crazy about the cartoons, because we were bo-both had art talent. And part of the art talent we had came from copying the cartoons from the newspaper st rips, which were taught to us by our father. Q: Really? A: Oh yes. He would sit us down on a Sunday, and take out a large sheaf of white paper, and start drawing Jig Œ Maggie and Jiggs , and Dick Tracy, and all the car Œ cartoons of those days, and it was like magic to me and Harry , and we became professional artists, and Œ but my father was very good at it. He Œ I think that had he pursued it as a career, he co uld have succeeded. But Œ Q: But isn™t that interesting, that he bequeathed to you Œ in some ways you se Œ you talk about sense of humor as something your parents both had, his talent in calligraphy, and how that translates to Œ to kind of fostering this Œ this drawing talent in young boys to Œ you know, copy the funnies out. A: Yes. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 18Q: That these are sort of like legacies in Œ in a way. A: Yes, they are. Q: Yeah. A: Well, he Œ he was Œ he was, unfortunately, a beaten man. And that took a lot out of him. Took a lot of the fun out of him. And the reason he was beaten is that, because of his frustration at not being able to keep his family in America, my mother was constantly taking us to Lithuania , he lost his job because of that. He Œ the first time we went to Lithuania , h-he Œ he ga Œ he just took off from his job as manager of a department store, and spent months and months trying to get us to come back. And when he returned, of course the Great Depression struck, I think that was 1929, and his job was eliminated . And he Œ the only jo b he could get was in the post office, because he had veterans benefits. Q: He fought in World War I? A: He was in World War I. Q: Where did he fight? A: He was Œ he was captured by the Germ ans, and suffered terribly in World War I. Q: Oh my goodness. A: And I remember I was so fascinated with World War I when I was a little boy, because there was still a lot of talk about it Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 19Q: Of course. A: Œ there was a lot of Œ a lot of veterans around. And I would constantly say to my father, you know, typically, Daddy, tell me what you did in the war. Q: Yeah. A: And he Œ I™ll never forget his answer, it was always the same, I shot lions. Q: Oh God. A: I said, Daddy, you didn™t go hunting for lions in the war. He says, oh, I did. The rest of them were shooting each other, but I was looking for lions. He didn™t want to talk about it. Q: Of course. A: I later found out from his brother, my Uncle Harry that he was captured by the Germans. And Germany was not Œ did not have the Nazi Œ Q: Of course. A: Œ anti-Semitic attitude at that time, so he was not mistreated as a Jew, he was di Œ mistreated as Œ as an Œ as an Œ not only as an American, but by the fact that there was not enough food for the German peop le, the captive Americans were given no food at all. So he Œ he starved, and s Œ like they all did, all the captives. So, he didn™t want to talk about the war at all, but my Uncle Harry filled me in on the months and months and months that he lived in Œ in a Œ in hovels, and Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 20Q: Was this when you were older that he filled you in on this? A: Yes, when I was older. Q: Yeah. A: When my father was no longer alive, he told me. I think my father must have told his brother, d-don™t Œ don™t te ll them about Œ you know, what Œ Q: People want to spare their children these things. A: Yeah. Q: They really do. A: I think so. He never wo Œ he never on ce mentioned a single thing about the war, and he would hide photogr aphs of him in uniform. Q: Really? A: Yeah, I Œ I Œ I foun Œ I got some sent to me by relatives, cousins of mine who inherited photographs from their mothers, and their mothers were sisters of my father. And there he was, looking very, ve ry snappy in Œ in a doughboy uniform. I think I included a picture in the book, if I Œ but I™m not sure. Q: Oh. But what di Œ I mean, in some ways, for someone who doesn™t want to talk about it, what a charming answer he gave you, you know. I was shooting lions. And so you have to go on that tread Œ on that thread of, no Daddy, you weren™t, it can™t be that way. Oh, yes I was, and Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 21A: Yeah, it wa Œ Q: Œ and he™s distracted you from the real question. A: Well, he distracted us and he entertained us. He took me and my brother Harry to all kinds of wonderful places, in and around Savannah . He took us to an airport to see airplanes doing their stunts. You have to remember that these are little Œ they look like model airplanes. And we were overjoyed. And of course, again, the admonition, don™t tell your mother what I bought for you to eat, you know, cause it™s not kosher. But Œ and he took us to merry-go-rounds, and loop-de-loops, and you know, all kinds of Œ Q: Fun things. A: Œ fun things. He Œ on his day off, he was wonderful. By the way, one of the things that was thrown at him when he was fired, was hi-his children™s destructiveness. He used to invite me and Harry Œ Harry and me Œ I hear my mother correcting me Œ to the toy department of the big departme nt store, and give us leave to play with the toys. Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. A: Well, we broke them, and we did all ki nds of terrible things, which my father told us not to worry about, he will pay for it. But just the same, they threw that up against Œ to my father when he was being let Œ let go. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 22Q: He sounds like a very doting father. A: He was. He would lie on the floor, co pying those cartoons ha lf the Sunday, you know, we Œ and he took us to the park, and introduced us to this Œ the friends he made in the park, and you know, h-he Œ he Œ and he bought us candies, and he did buy us hot dogs, cause we begged for it. And candied apples. You know, he wa Œ he was Œ he was a good daddy, and we loved going places with him. Q: So what happen ed at home? Was home life tens e because yo Œ you Œ your Œ we™re going to come to that part when you™re leaving, but did they get along, as far as you knew, your parents? A: They seemed to get along, but there were little problems that from Œ from a child™s point of view Œ and you have to reme mber that I™m six years old, five or six years old Œ my mother would complain ab out how much work there is to do. You know, typical Œ you have a lot of childre n, and you Œ you Œ you™re tired, and you complain. Q: Sure. A: And my father would take charge, a nd he™d hire an African American lady Œ where he got her, I don™t know, be Œ probably by asking questions. He was very friendly towards African American people. In fact, his Œ his favorite helper in the di Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 23Œ in the store was James , whom he would send on his bicycle to pick me and Harry up and bring us to the store, on a bicycle. Q: Whoa. A: Which my mother wasn™t crazy about either, but no Œ nothing bad ever happened, and we li Œ we li Œ we loved James. But then he would send Œ probably he would ask someone like James, do you know somebody wh o could Œ who could help out in the house and clean and wash dishes? And then he™d come home and my mother would be hysterical and say that she mixed the milk dishes with the meat dishes. Q: Non-kosher. A: There are certain basic things that do stick with people, even if they™re not strictly observant. You have two sets of di shes, just the way Catholics have certain things. Q: No fish on Friday. A: Yeah, no fish on Friday. Q: Yeah. A: I mean, no meat on Friday. Q: No meat on Friday. I™m sorry, you™re right, no meat on Friday, yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 24A: No meat on Friday. And you put a Œ a hamburger on their plate and they™ll Œ they will recoil. Q: Yeah. A: And with my mother, if you put a hamb urger on a plate that™s used for dairy products, she wouldn™t touch it. Q: Yeah. A: So, these are centuries of religious practices, but they™re not religious, they™re customs. They become cust oms. And even non-religious people are observant of customs. So she would become hysterical an d then say, I have to throw the dishes out. And my father would argue and say, you can™t throw dishes out just because someone made a mistake. You know, and that Œ those are the kinds of conflicts that they would have. Q: That the children would hear, that you would hear. A: We would hear it and it would be upsetting. But Œ and sometimes m-my mother™s creativity Œ she was very creative Œ aside from being a fi Œ an unbelievable mimic, she could act out poems and Œ and th ings like that, but she also had picked up notions that Œ about bathroom habits, a nd she decided that we must Œ that the children must go to the bathroom every da y. And the only way to guarantee that was to serve castor oil every day. Well, we rebelled against that, we wouldn™t Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 25we™d disappear. So, her creativity, she built a witch in the closet that was so real, and she would say, you will take your castor oil, or I™m putting you in the closet. And she™d open the door, and th ere was this living witch. Q: Oh my God, oh my God. A: By today™s standards, this is abusive treatment of children. Q: But Œ but it Œ you™re right, it™s very creative. A: It was very creative. We took Œ we took our castor oil. Q: Castor oil. A: Yep, we did take it. Q: Oh my God. A: But she had an obsession about that because even in Lithuania, she would send me to some woman in town who was Œ ha d a Œ a private apothecary, you know, not Œ not licensed by anybody, it wasn™t a drugstore or anything, but she made up potions. And one of the potions she made was a Œ a laxative. It was made from boiling the leaves Œ those little things that come down from a maple tree. Q: Oh, the little Œ the little Œ A: With two wings. Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Œ I don™t know what they™re called, but I know what you™re talking about. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 26A: They would float down like this. Q: That™s right. A: She would boil them, and it would turn into a black sludge of some kind, and supposedly my mother believed that that was a good laxative. But we wouldn™t go near it, witch or no witch. Q: So Œ well, the Œ you get older and th e witches lose some of their power, you know. A: That™s right. Q: You know. A: But I don™t look back on it with bitterness. I Œ you know, I thought it Œ I Œ I really thought she was very inventive, and I Œ I kind of admired that, and it™s Œ has stood me in good stead all these years be cause being inventive is the name of the game for me. I™ve created a lot of stuff, physical stuff, intellectual stuff, artistic stuff, and I think she imbued me with that idea. She inf Œ she created a lot of o-other things as well; a good deal of her own clothing. Q: Mm-hm, what about your clothing? A: I Œ I can™t recall that Œ that she specifically sewed anything, she must have. But she did take us to specialists in Lithuania who made shoes, made shirts, made volekkes (ph) and Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 27Q: I don™t know what that is, volekkes (ph). A: It™s a Œ a boot made out of felt. Q: Oh, wai Œ what are they called? Boots made out of Œ Q2: Veltiniai. Q: Veltiniai. In Lithuanian it™s veltiniai. A: Velkiniai? Q: Veltiniai, with a T. A: All right. So in Yiddish they Œ they pronounce it volekkes (ph). Q: Volekkes (ph), volekkes (ph), yes. A: You know. Q: Yes, yes, yes. A: But it was a felt boot. Q: Right. A: And you put a galosh over it to keep the Œ Q: The water out. A: Œ the water out. Q: Yeah. A: And we wore it all winter. Q: Were they warm enough? Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 28A: Oh, they™re warm. They™re very warm. It™s a very clever boot. It didn™t smell too good, but Œ but anyone who goes around smelling volekkes (ph) Œ Q: Has an issue. A: Œ deserves what he gets. Q: Yeah, exactly, yeah. Was she a warm mother? A: She could be. At times she was very warm, especially when she put her arms around us and read us the stories, or told the stories from her experiences as a young girl growing up in Zarasai . And Œ and talking about Œ you know, holidays were very, very big time things, just like Christmas is for non-Jews, Simchas Torah, which is celebrating the Torah, well it™s a joyous holiday, where you give each other gifts, and bags full of nuts and candy and all that kind of stuff. Simchas Torah Œ Torah , yes, the happiness of the Torah. Q: Mm-hm. A: Well, a lot of holiday Œ Passover was another holiday where Œ for Œ that children loved, and Œ Q: And this you remember from Savannah? A: Not from Savannah , no. Q: From Zarasai . A: From Zarasai . Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 29Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about Œ now let™ s get to Œ to the part where Œ where you Œ you leave. I mean, what are the conditions of the first time that you leave, how did it happen? It sounds like from what you™ve to ld me so far, the picture that™s been painted, it kind of comes out of the blue. Why would she want to leave? Q: The reason my mother wanted to leave, as far as I can understand it, was really very simple one. She had a father in Zarasai . She had a sister, Liefa(ph) in Zarasai , who was married to Moysai(ph) and Œ and they had a son, Danke(ph), Daniel, and Œ and she had friends that she had left behind. So she convinced my father that she would just like to go for a visit. Now of course, I wasn™t old enough to know Œ to be privy to their conversation, did she say to him, I want to go for a month, or two weeks. There must have been some kind of time limit discussed. Well, all I know is, the time was dragged on and on and on. Q: When did you leave, by the way, what year was it, do you know? A: 1926. Q: So you were four years old Œ five years old. A: I was five, yeah. Q: You were five. Do you remember the leaving? A: Oh sure. Q: Tell me about it. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 30A: We left Savannah, and got on a train, and arrived in New York City. Q: Was the first time you see New York? A: The first time I Œ I saw New York. And ostensibly, we were in New York, where the ship would be, and we stayed with relatives. And it was exciting for me, but also terrifying, because my mother took all of us Œ well, there were four of us. The youngest, David, must have been around six months old, I mean, he was very Œ Q: A baby. A: Œ he was a baby. He may have still been nursing, for all I know, I™m sure he was. And I remember she Œ she took us on a subway, and the doors were opening and closing, and people were getting on and getting off, and I would Œ I remember being so terrified that either I™ll get off and she™ll stay on the train, she™ll get off and I™ll Œ you know, and we™ll all get lost. Well, I couldn™t wait to get out of there, and then we wound up at some Muma™s(ph) place, an aunt. And Œ and that also was kind of crazy, because these were not mansions. They were lit Œ tiny little apartments in Œ in poor neighborhoods, and all the peop le squeezed into one big room, you know. Q: Yeah. A: And I Œ I don™t even remember if we ate there, or what we did, it was Œ i-it was Œ the Œ the experience was terrifying, but eventually we were schlepped onto a boat, and we Œ we left and a rrived in Œ I believe in Hamburg, Germany. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 31Q: That would be logical. A: Yeah. Q: That would be logical, that ™s where a lot of the boats Œ A: We were on the German Lloyd line, I know that. We arrived in Œ in Hamburg Œ and by the way, we had retu rn tickets on the German Lloyd line. Q: Okay. A: Which my father, when he came over after a year Œ I suspect that he was expecting us to come back every month, because my grandfather, I heard him yelling at my mother, go back to your husba nd. Are you crazy staying here with this whole bunch of children? Oh, they used to have terrible fights, because he really thought she had it made by going to America while they™re all stuck in Europe . Q: Sure, sure. A: And Œ Q: This was a poor place. A: Yes. Q: Y-You know, it was Œ A: I mean, she was a return immigrant. Q: Yeah. A: And it was just not logical, no one was doing that. So Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 32Q: And so what was the train ride? Then you took a train from Hamburg into Lithuania ? Do you ha Œ do you have any memories of that train ride? A: I Œ I have very little Œ I think it went into Kaunas. Q: Okay. A: Bec Œ and the reason why I think it went into Kaunas is because on the way home, we got on a train in Kaunas and got off in Hamburg. Q: Okay. A: So Œ Q: It had to be that way the other way too, yeah. A: Yeah, it had to be that way the other way. Q: Do you remember what your first impressions are when you come from the United States; from Savannah , which you knew well; and New York, which you had gotten just a glimpse of, and you come into either Kaunas or to Zarasai ; what kind of image there was in your mind of these places that you had arrived at? A: Well, I Œ I Œ I really thought that I was going into pre-history. I mean, people were barefoot in the street, and we were surrounded by Œ my brother Harry and I were surrounded by local little kids who were all barefoot and Œ and wearing ragged clothes that were patched, and Œ and we wear Œ wearing our little fl Œ Lord Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 33Fauntleroy s-suits that my mother insisted on . We hated those clothes, you know, we felt like clowns, you know, those little Œ Q: Oh God, it™s death to a little boy when ev erybody else is dressed the other way. A: With a tam o™ shanter and Œ I mean Œ and Œ and Œ and neither shorts nor long pants, but something that came just belo w the knee. And we Œ we felt so out of place. Q: This was Zarasai ? A: Pardon? Q: This was in Zarasai ? A: In Zarasai , yes. Q: Okay. A: And of course we didn™t understand, we were surrounded by little kids who are yammering away in a foreign language, and we didn™t know what they Œ the only thing that I understood is one kid said, you boxer. He goes like Œ you boxer. And then a chorus of them, you boxer. And I looked at Harry , I said, what is he saying? I didn™t understand. It was only later on that I found out that their hero was Jack Sharkey, a Lithuanian boxer in America who had won the heavyweight champion, and had become wealthy. The dream of wealth was just the only dream anyone had in those days. So Œ but also Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 34Q: Do you know if these were Œ do you know if these were Jewish kids, or these were Lithuanian kids Œ A: These were Jewish kids. Q: These were Jewish kids. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: We Œ we lived in the Œ in the Jewish section Œ Q: Of Zarasai . A: Œ o-of Zarasai . Although, the area that we rented a house in was not Jewish. Q: Can we cut? [break] Okay, this is just to say that we cut the camera because there™s drilling outside, and unfortunately the noise is such that it will be captured, but we™re going to keep on going. A: Okay. Q: Okay. So you lived in the Œ in the Jewish section of Zarasai , and so you remember these little kids su rrounding you when you first arrive, and you couldn™t understand what they were saying. A: That™s correct. Q: And how long did it take until that changed? Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 35A: I c Œ I couldn™t be sh Œ I Œ I Œ I couldn™t place a time as to how long it took me to integrate with the li Œ local language, but it Œ for one thing, my cousin Daniel , who was my age, grew up in a house with my Aunt Leifa (ph) and Uncle Moysai(ph), where they spoke French and English in addition to knowing Yiddish. Q: That™s pretty Œ A: They did Œ they did not speak Yiddis h among themselves. Of course they knew it because they had to speak it to certain clients and people like that. So I Œ I could have conversations with Daniel , and he would translate wh at the kids are saying, and then I would question Daniel, and I would say, tell me again, what does this mean? And he would explain it to Œ he was very bright, and he would explain it to me, and little by little I picked it up, and before long Œ you know, kids can learn things very quickly through experience rather than by rote. And just having the need to find out something, you le arn the words, so you can do what you want to do. I learned Russian that way. Q: Well, that was one of my questions, is did they speak Russian as well, did they speak any Lithuanian, did they Œ what were the number of languages, what were the languages that they spoke? A: Li-Lithuanian was not spoken within the family f-for whatever reason that I don™t know. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 36Q: Did you hear it outside? A: It Œ not often. Q: Okay. A: You heard it in the post office, and you heard it in the movie house. Of course, Lithuanians would come in. Th-The Œ th e land around the town was the Gentile area, where the Polish landowners and Lithuanian landowners had farms and orchards and things like that. J-Just like my landlord, Karowlka (ph), he Œ he and his brother and sister were of Polish descen t, but they had a very large orchard, and a bath house, and a Œ an estate, really. And it was a beautiful place, they had cows, and provided us with milk. Q: Was he the person you said was your father figure? A: Yeah, he became a f Œ at least a big brother. He wasn™t that much older, he was like Œ I remember when he went down for the test to be conscripted into the Lithuanian army, so he was 21. But to Œ to someone who was, at that time maybe 10, 21 is Œ is Œ Q: An adult. A: Yeah. And he would take us s-spearfishi ng, regular fishing. He would Œ he Œ he Œ once a month it was his assignment by my mother to take us to our little bathhouse, which was a steam Œ a sauna. An d we had great times with him, he was Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 37Œ he was Œ he really was like a big brother or a father. He taught us a lot, and we didn™t speak Œ he di Œ he could not speak a word of Yiddish, so even by the time I was fluent in Yiddish, I knew enou gh Russian. And Russian was the lingua franca there during tsarist times. Q: Yes. A: So, whether you were Jewish, Polish or whatever, ye Œ if you wanted to get by you had to speak Russian. So I learne d a lot of basic Russian, and I could communicate with Karowlka (ph), with Anna and Ziegmund (ph) very, very easily in Russian. Q: How did they come Œ how did they intersect with your life: Karowlka(ph) and Anna and Ziegmund (ph), and how did you meet? Wh at was Œ how was it that you got to know them? A: I Œ my mother was looking to rent a place, and they had one big house which they lived in, and then they had a little cottage next Œ nearby Œ next door, that they rented, and my mother rented it. And so we were on the same grounds, really. Q: How did she pay for this? A: Pardon? Q: How did your mother pay for this? A: Pay for it? Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 38Q: Yeah. A: Well, my father sent money regularly. As a matter of fact, she was constantly telling us to write to our father that we are desperate for money, that we have no food. And later my father told me, I was sending money Œ he ha d postal receipts that he showed me, about that high. He was sending money all the time. But she was also giving money away. She believed in the Talmudic, or Torah thing about Tzedakah , which is giving to the poor. And whoever Œ who-whoever she found out about through the synagogue or people she kn ew, that so and so was desperately out of money and couldn™t survive, she would give them a chunk of money. So I Œ I didn™t object to that really, except, you know, we all have the feeling of, your first duty is at home. Q: Yeah. A: But we survived, so it Œ there were other people who were good to us. So Œ Q: Tell me a little bit about your wider family there. You mentioned that your grandfather, your mother™s father, still lived there. How did Œ what was his way of Œ of making a living? What did he do? A: He was loosely called an avokat(ph), which is an attorney. Q: Okay. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 39A: Now, I don™t think that he had a formal lawyer™s education. First of all, it was a big joke about getting into the gymnasium. You coul d only get into the gyna Œ gymnasium if you found a Gentile kid and got him in, then the two of you could get in. That was the rumor. Q: And gymnasium is Œ is Œ is the high school? A: The high school, yeah. Q: Okay. A: So going to Œ going to higher education was virtually impossible Œ Q: For a Jew? A: Œ for Jews, yeah. They Œ well, you know, I was too young to know the details, and I would really love to know what the restrictions were. Maybe Œ maybe they just couldn™t pass the test, I don™t know. But f Œ from the information I was getting, if you™re Jewish, you can™t get into the gymnasia. Q: Okay. A: Okay. So we accepted that. Q: Okay. A: And a lot of Jewish kids did not go to public schools, they went to cheders or yeshivas. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 40Q: And what about you when you were ther e? Did you go to Œ which kind of school did you go to? A: My mother sent us to a cheder, which I hated and I st opped going to it, because I was not interested in the religious part of it. I mean, I must have gotten that from my father, but my mother wanted us to Œ so then she hired tutors, and I found the religious part interesting, as long as it wasn™t hammered into our heads. Q: In that cheder, can you describe to me what it was that you hated about it? What was Œ what were the instruction like, what were the teachers like? What were some of the other kids like? A: Well, there was a lot of hitting, you know, rulers on the hands and there was a Œ a lot of disciplining, and since I didn™t understand what the discipline was for, it was frightening, and Œ and I really did Œ I hated going to school. But I enjoyed having the tutor because my mother hired a Œ a very bright young man who not only went through the Bible and made it Œ made the Bible stories interesting, like Noah™s ark and stuff like that, but he also dealt with science, and explained science and geography. I remember him telling us Œ and I used to be able to recite all the Japanese islands, because he Œ he taught us all about China and Japan and India, and it was like going on a trip. It was Œ that was very enjoyable. But that was one to Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 41one and he wasn™t threateni ng us and telling us if we don™t behave we™re going to get hit, you know. Q: Yeah. A: So school was Œ first of all, in school, you had a Œ a lo Œ a Œ a lot of unruly kids. I like to believe I wasn™t one of the unrul y ones, but the Œ the guy running the thing was Œ didn™t care about distinctions, he just walked around with a stick or a ruler or something and it was very scary. I guess I Œ I just didn™t like the discipline of the Œ the religious discipline Œ Q: Well, you hadn't been old en ough to start school in the United States, had you? When you left at age five or six, had you already started any kind of education here in the States ? A: I did go to Œ I Œ I did go to something in school. I Œ I ke Œ I don™t want to use the term kindergarten. I started school in Savannah, I remember that. And I remember being bullied by the older kids, and especially with my name, Abraham, which, if I didn™t get bullied by anti-Semites, then I got bullied by confederates, you know, because the name Abraham Lincoln was poison in Savannah. I mean, you gotta remember, it™s almost a century ago. Q: So this is Œ this is still living me Œ in the 20s, with still living memory of the Civil War. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 42A: Sure. Q: Yeah. A: Sure. I mean wa Œ the minute I would mention my name in polite company, people would look at me like Œ with daggers. Q: And your parents would have had no idea when they named you that it could have this kind of effect? A: No. Q: They™re totally from a totally different tradition. A: Yes, the Bible. Q: Yeah. A: Now th Œ it happens that the southern people are very Œ they™re very Bible conscious, and the Œ the Œ the Old Testament and the Ne w Testament are, I think revered by Christians everywhere. Q: That™s right. A: So that wasn™t the problem, but the association they were making Œ nobody was naming their child in the south, Abraham. Q: Yeah. A: I mean, any more than after the Amer ican Revolution, I don™t think anyone was calling their kid King George. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 43Q: Exactly. No Georges . A: No Georges. Q: [indecipherable] we had George Washington , so Œ A: No, George Washington was the revolutionary. Q: That™s right, but we have a King George who was defeated, and we have a George Washington , so maybe George is a neutral name, cause both of them had it. A: Well, George Washington had his name while he was a subject of the king of England. Q: Absolutely. A: Yeah. Q: Absolutely. A: He just didn™t change his name after defeating King George. Q: That™s right. A: So anyway Œ Q: Right. So you experienced Œ there™s something I wanted to pick up on. Did you experience, you know, anti-Se mitism in the world of children, when you were in Savannah? A: In Savannah , yes, to some minor degree. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 44Q: How did that express itself? A: No, it Œ I can™t say it was anti-Semitism. Maybe from the neighborhood that I lived in. You know, people of similar interests tend to congregate. It Œ people of color, of course, were segregated by color. But very Œ I Œ I Œ I remember when I mo Œ came back from Lithuania and moved Œ moved in Œ my father and I shared a r Œ a room, and rented a room in the Bronx. And the building I lived in, I made friends with a couple of Jewish kids, and they wa rned me not to go on certain streets, where the Italians lived, and on another street where the Irish lived. And it wasn™t that there were Œ they were Œ none of these streets had a hundred percent Jews, a hundred percent Irish, a hundred percent Italian, but they were predominantly of one ethnic or religious gro up. And if you Œ if I walked to school on the wrong street, I™d be sure to get beaten up. I was chased, and I found out. So then, after being chased, my friend Hilton said, never go on that street. They™ll catch you, they™ll Œ they™ll take your shoes, they™ll take everything away from you. So I said okay. It was just Œ those conflic ts go on and on. I mean, even in Ireland where they were all Christian and they were killing each other, you know. Q: Well, what about Œ what about Lithuania ? Did you also have Œ I want to make a comparison. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 45A: Yes. We s Œ we stayed pretty much in the Jewish areas. Now, that™s not to say that there weren™t some Gentiles living in Jewish areas, and some Jews living in Gentile areas. There are people who find acceptance because they integrate and they™re not threatening, and they Œ they just don™t develop friendships, they don™t eat at each other™s houses and thing Œ they don™t have coffee klatches, but they leave each other alone. They don™t hit them Œ Q: Pick on each other. A: Yeah, they don™t hit each other. So Œ but I knew all the areas in Œ in Zarasai that were Œ that had Jewish homes mixed in with non-Jewish homes, and no one was likely to attack me, because they knew that I would r un to the Jewish home, and then it would be a whole big hullaballoo between grownups. Q: So it was a safer area. A: A safer area, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: We Œ you automatically Œ but I di dn™t feel threatened anywhere. I Œ Harry and I wandered all over town, and into non-Jewish areas. And certainly no grownup would ever do anything to a child in Lithuania, that I never even thought of it, but you ought to watch out for the Œ for kids your own age, because fighting was, you know, what kids do Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 46Q: Yeah. A: Œ for any reason, you know, that they can think of. So Œ Q: When Œ when you came to Zarasai , what was, if there is one thing, or two things, that struck you as the strangest th ings you™d ever seen ? Because you™d come from a different world. You™d come from Œ I mean, Savannah is certainly different than New York City, but that™s the world of the United States, and you come to this one, and you™ve mentioned that it™s like being in pre-history, but what was the strangest thing that you saw? Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of automobiles. There was not a single automobile. In fact, when one would be coming in from Kovno, that we had heard about, all the kids would gather to run after the car. And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust, because it was such an unusual smell. And that struck me. The other thing was that you could find food on trees everywhere. A ll you had to do was walk in a certain area where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries. We used to go after those things. Q: Well, that sounds lovely Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 47Q: Œ you know? That™s Œ A: We were constantly eating fruit of some kind or another. The currant bushes were hanging over fences everywhere. You could walk along and just with your hand pull off big loads of ye llow and red, what we called paretsky(ph). Q: Mm-hm. And Œ and what about Œ you said your grandfather was sort of like an advokat (ph), maybe without formal training, but nevertheless, that. What was Œ what would he do? What was he Œ A: He Œ he interceded on behalf of Jewish people who ne eded to go to court about s-some Œ some matter. It Œ it wasn™t things like divorce, or Œ or suing a storekeeper. What it was, I think, is these people received a notice that there was a Œ some kind of violation. Either they left their horse out in the street, or who knows what? And my grandfather Œ now, I never heard him speak Lithuanian, and I suspect that he really couldn™t speak Lithuanian becau se they really were refugees from Russia. But he did speak Russian fluently, and he might have learned e nough Lithuanian to get by, for all I know, I just never heard him speak it. So he would Œ a Œ a Jewish person who had received a notice that he has to come to the court, my grandfather would represent him. And as a large landowner in town, he Œ he did, he ow Œ he owned a Œ a very big hous e on what would be in New York a sw Œ an entire square block. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 48Q: Wow. A: Yeah, it was a large property, filled with lumber that my unc Œ Uncle Moysai(ph) was dealing in, and Œ and also po ppy fields, and fruits and vegetables growing there Œ Q: In town? A: Oh, it was a fantastic garden. Fantastic. And we used to go there all the time to pick fruit and stuff. So he was a prominent landowner. How he got it, I have no idea. Q: What was his name? A: Haim Gordon . Q: Gor Œ so is that your mother™s maiden name? A: My mother™s maiden name was Gordon. Q: So she was Mildred Gordon in English, but in Œ in Yiddish it would have been Milcha(ph)? A: Michla(ph) Gordon . Q: Michla(ph) Gordon . A: Yeah. Q: Michla(ph) Gordon . A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 49Q: And Œ and his name wa Œ again, his first name, your grandfather™s? A: Haim . Q: Haim Gordon . A: That™s Hyman. Q: Mm-hm. A: Yeah. Q: And can you paint a picture for me a bout what the house looked like that he lived in? Was it a brick, a stone, a wood? How many floors, things like that. A: My grandfather™s house was a wooden house, but very, very elegant. It was not very wide, but very, very long. When I say not very wide, it Œ it Œ I Œ my guess would be, let™s see, it had bedrooms on each side, and then a long hallway. It might have been say 50 feet wide, but maybe a Œ a 120 feet long, so Œ Q: That™s large. A: It was very large, and made of wood, and it had many, many big rooms: music room, bedrooms on both sides, a huge kitchen and a huge dining room, where my grandfather entertained local big shots, wh ich is Œ was where he got his power in the courtroom, because he was Œ now he must have spoken a language Œ I™m sure he was fluent in Russian, and probably all the big shots in Lithuania were fluent in Russian. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 50Q: Yes, they would have been. A: Yeah, because it was a part of Russia Œ Q: Right. They would have Œ A: Œ shor Œ you know, I was there in the 1920s. Well, in 1914, it was Russia. Q: That™s right, that™s right. A: So it™s not that far back. Q: Sure. Educated people got their degrees, their higher education at Russian universities. A: They did. Q: Yeah. A: I mean, there was no university in la Œ in Zarasai . Q: Yeah. A: And in Kovno there was a university, but who could travel from Œ Q: Zarasai Œ A: Œ Zarasai to Œ there were no cars. Q: Yeah. A: So Œ Q: How did you get from Kovno to Zarasai ? So did you take a bus? Was there a bus route, or Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 51A: We took a bus. Q: Okay, so they did have bus routes at that point. A: They did have a bus that came once in a while. Q: Okay. A: Once in a while. I did have a fantastic e xperience wher Œ all the kids did. It was in the winter, and the Lithuanian air force Œ I™m saying this slowly, so it should sink in, we found out that the Lithuanian air force was going to land on the lake. Q: So it must have been winter, with Œ it™s frozen. A: Pardon? Q: The wi Œ lake must have been frozen. A: The lake would freeze. They pulled out six foot slabs of ice from the lake in the wintertime. Q: Wow. A: They used to saw it, and then pull it out, and put it in a barn, and cover it with straw, for it Œ later in the Œ Q: Right. A: Œ spring, you know, to preserve butter and stuff like that. Well, the air force, three airplanes came in and landed on the ice. And all the kids and half Œ a lot of the grownups, we all ran out on the ice. And th ere was some talk, what if the ice cracks, Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 52you know, and we all go down into the lake. But it couldn™t. Th Œ I think the ice froze to six or eight feet. Q: That™s how far north it was, huh? A: Yeah. Q: Mus Œ then it was co ld in the wintertime. A: It had a nickname. Q: What was that? A: Lithuania is the Siberia of Lithuania Œ Zarasai is the si Œ Q: Siberia of Lithuania. A: Siberia of Lithuania. Q: Wow. A: Yeah, we used to kid about that, but it was a Œ it was a lovely little town, and you have to picture the town Œ I-I-I™ll draw a word picture. Q: Sure. A: Here is a big lake. In the middle of th e lake is a mountain. And you cut off the top of the mountain, and you build a town on it. Q: Oh my goodness. A: So, in the wintertime, any road going down to the lake became a sledding thing. Q: Opportunity. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 53A: Yeah. We would ride the sled down, out onto the ice, it would go out 500 feet out onto the ice after going down the hill. It was terrific. And everyone had a sled. So Œ Q: You Œ going back to your grandfather™s house, it sounds like a very well-to-do house, actually, if he had separate rooms fo r different functions, and a large kitchen. A: Yes, yes. Q: Now, to get a sense of, you know, the differences in modernity, did it have electricity? A: No. Q: Did it have indoor plumbing? A: No. Q: How was it heated? A: I Œ it was heated by fireplaces. Q: Coal, do you think, or by wood? A: By wood. Q: By wood, okay. A: I mean, my Uncle Moysai(ph) had 2,00 logs out in the Œ in the big garden. No, they Œ they had plenty of wood. I di Œ I Œ I don™t remember seeing fires going in a lot of fireplaces. I Œ I Œ I slept there during the winter and y-you climbed under Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 54quilts this thick, and it was cold. I mean, if you got out of bed it was freezing. And you didn™t want to have to go outside to the outhouse. That™s Œ that was the plumbing. Q: So, during this time, you™re Œ you™re still a little boy, even though you™re the oldest in the family. A: Yeah. Q: You™re still th Œ you know, you™re little. Did you miss your dad? A: Oh sure, but you know, children are am azingly adaptable. They Œ they can be put off, you know. You may not be Œ be able to put them off if you promised them an ice cream cone. They™ll nag you for that ice cream cone forever. But if you tell them, you™ll see your father in six months Œ you don™t even know what six months are. Q: Exactly. A: You know, so you say, all right, so I™ ll wait, so I™ll wait. And Œ but you nagged. Now, don™t forget my father wrote to us all the time, and we looked forward to those. He would write to us in a roll of funny papers that would be a roll like that. Q: So he™d send you funny papers. A: Sent. We got a notice every month or so, to come to the post office and pick up this roll of funny paper. And Harry and I would like on the floor reading these Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 55things for hours on Œ we maintained our English Œ our abilities in English, I think by reading and rereading thes e funny papers over and over and over again. And then we would read them and transl ate them to our friends as well. Q: Well, that™s so cool. A: Yeah. Q: They get to see these, and Œ did they have Œ did th ey have anything like funny papers or cartoons that were from the area, from Lithuania [indecipherable] A: Not Œ not from Lithuania , but from Germany Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ there was something Ziegmund (ph) and Ignatz or something like that, you know. Little Œ little mischievous kids who were playing tricks on older people, and stuff. And we used to laugh hilariously at those. But they were hard to get. Only once in a while someone who traveled came back and brought papers with them, and we were dropped off at my grandfather™s hous e, and then my cousin Daniel would bring it to us, and they were s Œ they were very cosmopolitan so Œ Q: Well, it sounds that way, with that many languages in the home Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 56Q: That speaks of not Œ it could be a remote area, it could be the Siberi Œ Zarasai being the Siberia of Lithuania, but it still means that there is a wider perspective of the world. A: Yes. Daniel, we never spoke Yiddish with hi m, only English. But his parents spoke English to him, as well as French. Q: And so where would they have gotten those? A: I cannot figure it out, they Œ they must have been eager beavers. Or you could chalk it up to upwardly mobile, you know, pretentious. Snobs, even, you know. I mean, let™s face it, if you learn a language Œ if you learn Chinese and you live in a country there™s not a single Chinese person, then it™s out of curiosity more than anything else, but the Œ Eng lish and Œ and French were c onsidered very high class. And just being able to flaunt it was Œ Q: What about German in the 1920s? Be cause for so many people, Jews and non-Jews alike, Germany was the land of culture. A: Yes. And we saw many, many German language films in my Uncle Moysai™s(ph) theater, and Œ Q: This is in Zarasai , or in Kovno ? A: In Zarasai , and in Kovno as well. Q: So there was a Œ so there was a theater in Œ in Zarasai , there was a cinema there. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 57A: He had the Bongo there, and then he opened another one in Kovno. Q: So he owned a cinema? A: He owned two Œ two mo-movie theaters. Q: Well, that™s a good uncle to talk up, my goodness. A: Yeah Œ no, Moysai(ph) was Œ oh, he was such a spectacular guy. He even survived the war, and he survived his wife, survived his son, and wound up with a family in Israel. He Œ he Œ he was doer. Q: Moysai(ph) Gordon was his name, or Œ A: He took the name Gordon. Q: Mm-hm, because of his wife, yeah [indecipherable] A: Because of his wife, yeah, I don™t know what his real name was. Q: Who was your mother™s sister. Okay. A: Btu he was like adopted by my gr andfather, I guess, and lived with my grandfather. But Moysai (ph) was a go-getter. I mean, he was a very big, tall, handsome guy. I mean, I used to look up to him. And Œ but when the German films, when he showed the German films, I could understand everything because of Yiddish. It™s close enough, and it™s especially when they Œ they™re just using common everyday things like [speaks German] Q: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 58A: [German] you know. It™s easy en ough to understand. If s Œ if someone recently Œ in recent times asked me if I had any interest in the Jewish newspaper in New York, and I said Œ Q: You mean [indecipherable] A: ﬁThe Forwards.ﬂ I said, I can read it, but I said, you gotta remember that my Yiddish speaking was up to the age of 12, I Œ so I don™t have an intellectual connection to Yiddish, I just know basi c Yiddish. And if you start going into complicated philosophical stuff, I don™t know what it Œ what it™s about. But the movies, everything was, are you going out, are you coming in, are you Œ you know Œ Q: Do you love me, do you not? A: Do you love me? Are yo u going to eat? You know, so that I could understand cause it™s the same. Q: So Zarasai itself, it had a movie theater, I didn™t know, in the 20s. A: It had Œ Q: You say it had a movie theater? A: And it was named The Bongo. Q: The Bongo. A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 59Q: And did it have any kind of like, departme nt store, or general store? What did the town square look like? I™m asking two qu estions at the same time, my apologies. A: Since I didn™t have any money, and shopping was also somewhat of anathema, I™m not aware of store Œ everything was made to order. All my shoes were made to order, all my shirts, my coat. When winter was approaching, my mother started to schlepp us to the Œ Q: Tailor™s. A: Œ to the tailor™s, to the bootmakers, to the Œ you know, to the Œ stockings. I had to go to a place to have stockings made. So Œ Q: What about bakeries? Were there bagels? A: There were places where you could buy bagels. There were also ladies who walked down the street with strings of bagels, shouting [speaks Russian] That™s in Russian. There were bakeries, yeah, you could Œ you could buy bread. I know we didn™t bake anything. And we scratched for food. Q: Were you hungry? A: I was hungry a lot, yeah. My mother didn™t pay much atte ntion to supplying food. That™s one of the things where she fell down . And we™d be waiting and starving and she™d Œ finally she would co me home and we figure, maybe there™s something to eat. And you never knew wh at it would be. Sometimes it would be Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 60once it was a big bag of grapes. Somebody brought it in from somewhere. But on Œ another time Œ and I hated this Œ she bro ught like a pound of butter, and a pound of white cheese, and mashed it all together, and Œ and we ate that with bread, and it was not fulfilling. Q: Was that a change from how she had been in Savannah, if in Savannah she was so careful about kosher food? A: Oh, all of this was kosher. Q: Still kosher. A: Yeah. Q: But sh Œ it sounds like you never went hungry in Savannah . A: I don™t know, I wa Œ in Savannah you c Œ it™s important to remember that I was not yet six. Q: I know. I™m asking such unfair questions. A: No, no, it™s Œ Q: If someone asked me, what were you doi ng at five years old, and I Œ you know, in details Œ A: Yeah, I Œ Q: Œ I couldn™t do it. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 61A: Œ I honestly don™t remember what food was about. The thing we looked forward to in Zarasai was something called cholent. Cholen t is a big iron pot, about the s Œ bigger than a basketball Œ about the size of a ba-basketball. A s-s-solid iron pot. And all kinds of stuff went into it: sliced carrots, peas, chicken, potato, even onion. And [indecipherable] water, and it was just a huge stew in there. Must have been five pounds worth of food in there, and I had to carry it to a communal oven, Friday before sundown. And it would be shoved into a communal oven. And then Saturday night, after sundown, I would go pick it up and carry it for five kilometers. Oh God, what a chore this was. I™m not yet 12 year s old, I™m a Œ maybe 10 or 11. And a Œ it Œ well, we built a wagon, Harry and I, and we used to pull it. Someone gave us broken parts of yo-yos. They were ma king yo-yos in a mill, a wooden mill. Q: Really? A: Yeah. And they would br eak apart, and they wouldn™ t bother putting it together, so they gave it Œ we had a friend there, and he gave me a bag full of Œ Q: Yo-yos. A: Œ y-yo-yo discs. We made wagons out of it and all kinds of toys out of it, and I think one of them was a wagon that we could pull Œ Q: The cholent Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 62A: Œ with this heavy thing in it. Now, I gotta tell you that when that came home, it was still piping hot, because it™s Œ Q: The iron kept the heat. A: Œ an iron pot, and Œ and that stuff was boiling when we picked it up. And it cooled off enough to be able to eat it, and it was delicious. That Œ you know, it™s a great stew, I mean, potatoes and carrots and chicken and Œ I think she put some honey in it too, I Œ but it was Œ it was just delicious. And that™s the best meal of the week that we had. Otherwise it was a lot of herring. It re Œ herring was easy to get. Is Œ this comes in a barrel. So we™d each get a herring and a piece of bread. But it™s not a fulfilling diet. Q: How Œ how did your mother spend her days? A: Either with friends, or she was in the shul, I don™t know which one she was doing. We Œ I Œ I™m Œ I™m sure she had a lot of friends, or she pref Œ or took care of sick old people. That was part of her charity work. Q: But her kids na Œ it sounds like you were kind of raising yourselves. A: We were raising ourselves, yes, we were. And then Karowlka (ph) and Anna and Ziegmund (ph), they would Œ they wo uld grab hold of me and Harry Œ my mother very often took the younger ones with her. Q: Okay. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 63A: They™d grab hold of Harry and me and they™d bring me into their house, kitchen, big dining ta Œ table, and they™d say, are you hungry? And we™d say yes. And Karowlka (ph) would say, well, we have so me good food, but if you tell your mother, you will never, ever be able to eat here again. So we s Œ Harry and I would say, we won™t tell, we won™t tell. And I think we even got pork chops. But we didn™t care. Q: Do you remember that kind of food? Was it very different from the food you were used to at home? Or was it just, it™s a meal? A: Not the chicken, very Œ chicken and fish, you know. You used to go out and spear fish. So you get a nice big pike, about that long, and that was delicious, you know. Had a lot of little Y bones, but you learn to spit them out. Q: Yeah. A: And oh, I loved going ther e, you know, that was great. And they were very sweet people. Ziegmund (ph) was a tailor by Œ taught hims elf to be a tailor, and you know, freelance tailoring. Anna was the housekeeper, she t ook care of the cow and the sheep and the chickens and all of that kind of stuff, and the garden. And they had a lush garden, so we got plenty of vegeta bles. And fruit galore. In fact, his orchard was so productive that he would rent it out in the summer to a entrepreneur who would come and pick loads of the stuff and sell it to the stores. But we could go in Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 64there and pick apples and pear and currants and gooseberries, wonderful stuff. But that™s in the summertime. In the wintertime you have to rely on slaughtering the chickens, and Œ I had pet chickens, too. Q: Did you? A: Yeah. Q: Did they have names? A: Hm? Q: Did they have names? A: They did, but I forget. I had one favorite chicken and Œ and I thought she was lost. And then one day, she™s found, she marches out from under the outhouse, I think, I can™t know where she was. And she™s followed by little chicks. So I Œ I became a father. And I know that was very exciting. I really thought that either somebody had grabbed her and eaten her Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ or she just got lost, but she just wa s in confinement. And she marched out with the little things peeping. It™s very exciting life, you know I Œ I feel like I was a Jewish Huckleberry Finn. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 65Q: You know, it sounds that way. There sounds li Œ the picture that you™re painting alternates between a place that is back ward technologically, but has a lot of wonderful features to it, you know. A: Oh, it Œ I had a wonderful time. We did Œ we did have a certain amount of fear, because there was conflict, and it wasn™t Œ it™s Œ it shouldn™t be confused with institutional anti-Semitism, such as Nazism. No, it was just the conflicts of religious belief. And this goes on between Muslims and Hindus, between northern Ireland and southern Ireland, you know, it goes on all over the world; Nigeria, you name it. Q: So you wouldn™t say if I Œ if I Œ it doesn™t sound like it would be more different than in other places of the world. It would be what you have in other places in the world. A: Absolutely. It™s just that there were Œ there was tribalism, cliques. But tribalism is really what it is. Gentile kids hung out with Gentile kids, Jewish kids hung out with Jewish kids, and if the two came together, there would be conflict. So Œ and then, of course, there were terrible rumors that were spread about Jews drinking the blood of Christian children on Passover, you know. Someone starts a terrible story, and it gets passed along, because people Œ there are people who want to create trouble. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 66Q: Well, you know, I don™t know enough about this, I would like to research it more. But, you know, sometimes I connect dots and I have to research to find out whether or not the connection is really valid. But the part of the world you™re talking about, which we™ve already emphasize d, was part of the tsarist empire at one point. A: Yes. Q: And when the revolutionary movements were happening in the 19 th century, that alarmed the authorities that were in power. A: Yes. Q: That there were these revolutionary movements. And the secret police, the Okhrana, secret police Œ this is what I have heard, and I™d have to research it Œ created The Protocol of the Elders of Zion . A: Yes. Q: And so, if this was the place where this was created, and it then had a power, you know, it got disseminated, this is in those territories. A: Yes. Q: Something sticks. Something Œ A: It was even picked up here in America by Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 67A: Œ the head of the Ford motor company, Edsel Ford Œ Q: That™s right. A: He picked up the Œ Q: Protocols. A: Œ Protocols of Zion , which is why he was Œ he favored Hitler™s solution, and he was a major anti-Semite, and Œ beca use he believed The Protocols of Zion , which was a fabrication. Q: Yes, complete. A: Complete fabrication. You could do th is with any group, you could do it with black people, you could do it to Irish people, to a-anybody. Just pick some little Œ Q: Thing. A: Œ thing, and enlarge it into a big fairy tale. So Œ and the Œ the spreading of notions like Christ killers. Q: That™s right, I was going to mention that too. So that comes from one force, and then you have Œ and then you have unfor tunately, the Catholic church and other Christian denominations. But mostly, it would have been the Catholic church that, for centuries, talked about that, you know. A: Yes, well, I Œ I™m Œ I™m not well enough educated in these matters to Œ to take sides as to who the guilty pa rty is, and who the innocent. The innocent party, as we Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 68always know, are the ones who are singled out for attack. They Œ no group is as guilty o-o-of any crime Œ first of all, you can™t make a group guilty, they™re Œ they™re Œ within a group, ev en a Œ a group of bigots, there™s somebody who says, wait a minute, we™re going too far with this. This is not Œ yo-you know Œ Q: That™s right. A: Œ this is not a human attitude. So I™m sure there were Nazis who had doubts about what they were doing, but you either go along, or you™re Œ you become part of the pariah group. So it™s Œ it™s a Œ it™s a tu Œ it™s a tough call, but it Œ tribalism has been going on since the Œ since time began, and it un Œ it undoubtedly will go on forever and ever. Q: Yeah. A: The best we can do is learn lessons from these things, and try to pass along the notion that people aren™t inherently bad. People are born into certain circumstances beyond their ability to do anything about, you know, and Œ and if they become part of the cursed, they are in terrible trouble, that™s all there is to it. So I think the Holocaust Museum™s function, in my view , is to set the record straight about bigotry, and depression, and indiscriminate intolerance Œ Q: Absolutely. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 69A: Œ and Œ and Œ and creating victims. We have to Œ we have to not do that to any human being. I wouldn™t torture Hitler if I had a chance to do so. I would Œ I would separate him from Œ from others so that he can™t do any more harm, but I certainly wouldn™t take revenge on him by, you know, doing terrible things to him. He™s a Œ he was a human being as well, but Œ this is just my feeling is that revenge gets you absolutely nothing. The only Œ th e only terrific revenge is to educate, so that terrible things are looked upon as terr ible things, and they turn everyone™s stomach, and no one wants to do them any more. Q: We can hope. We can hope. A: That™s what we want. Q: Yeah. Can we cut here? [break] When did your father show up? You know, you Œ I™d like to get the chronology straight, because you say there was some back and forth, and that your mother took you to Lithuania not just one time. A: Yes. Q: So that means there was a time that you had to come back to the States, or you did come back to the States . A: Yes. The chronology of events with my father were basically; one year in Lithuania , 1926 to 1927. Then back to Œ my father comes to Lithuania and takes us back to America. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 70Q: Does he take your mother, too? A: Yeah, all of us, we all come back. Q: And do you Œ do you remember what that was like when he arrived? A: Oh yes. It was a Œ well, it was a great relief and a great surprise when I Œ we found out, Harry and I were Œ we got a message to come to our grandfather™s house. So we go there, and there™s our father. So our father said, well, I™ve come to take you home, on and on and on. And I don™t Œ here my memory is a little shaky. I don™t know if he came with me and Harry to the house that my mother was renting, and told her Œ or if she came to my gra ndfather™s house. But in any case, we were all ordered to pack up and get ready to go back home. Q: So that™s pretty sudden. A: That was very sudden. It Œ I don™t know if my mother had any warning. She probably received mail that said I™m Œ you Œ if you don™t come back by such and such a date, I™m coming to get you and I™m going to drag you all back here. So it wa Œ now this is 19 Œ somehow I™m rememb ering prohibition, be cause my father picked up a Œ a Œ a Œ a prized bottle of wine Œ [sirens] have to wait til that Œ [break] Q: So you were mentioni ng something about your fa ther and prohibition and a bottle of wine? Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 71A: Yes, and it Œ Q: Tell me about that. A: When he opened the suitcase, and it was Prohibition, I think he wanted to celebrate in New York with the family that we were staying with, relatives, and he went for his bottle of wine and it was broken in the suitcase. Q: Oh. A: I mean, during Prohibition, to lose such a valuable Œ I thought I Œ he was gonna cry. Q: Poor guy. A: Anyway, that™s Œ Q: So did your mother not protest about going back? A: I think there must have been a m Œ an ultimatum of some sort. He Œ she Œ I™m sure she didn™t want to come back, but in any case, we Œ we did come back, and Œ but she didn™t want to go to Savannah , she wanted to stay in New York. So she made him rent a house in the Rockaways . So I had a year of living on the water in Rockaway beach, and becoming an American beachcomber, you know. Another experience entirely. But my father was out of a job, because of this problem of Œ Q: You mentioned that earlier Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 72Q: Œ that he had Œ he Œ becau se he took off to get you, he was away from the store. A: Too much. And he was threatened with being fired if he went Œ if he went off, and sure enough he was fired. So when he came back Œ however the son of the man who owned the department store had a bank in the Œ one of the Carolinas, North Carolina or South Carolina . And he offered my father the opportunity of operating a refreshment stand in the bank, with Coca -Cola and Œ you know, sandwiches and stuff like that. So my fath er hired somebody down there to help him, and established this little business, from which he was ma-managing to send money to my mother in the Rockaways , to pay for the house we lived in. And that went along smoothly for almost a year, when she hysterically notified my father that I was Œ I was Œ that I was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. Which was true, but she made it sound much worse than it really was. Q: Well, being hit by a car does sound kind of serious. A: Well, it was Christmastime. Q: What happened? A: And I was on the street, in ra Œ in Rockaways , and across the street was Santa Claus. And I wanted to run over and see Santa Claus . Now, I was probably around eight at this time, so I ran across and got hit by a car and was in the hospital. So my father came to the hospital. At this point, the thing in the bank collapsed, that he Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 73had. That was taken away from him because what happened was, the man he hired to help him, stole everything, and moved it out of the bank. So, you know, it™s like a soap opera. Q: Well, he had Œ you know, if he didn™t care about his family, then he probably could have saved everyt hing, but it Œ clearly, he cared about you Œ A: Oh, he did, he did. Q: Œ he cared about Œ and so, that took priority. A: We survived the Holocaust because he cared. And that I can get to very quickly. Q: I™d like to hear that part, yeah. We can talk about it now and then go back and fill in the gaps. A: All right. You mentioned that he cared about us. Well, here™s how he cared about us. In 1933, Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and was going to clean all of Europe , if not the world, of Jews. Judenrein , it was going to be. Well, my father ba Œ at that point, the only way he could survive after losing the thing in the bank, was to apply to the post office for a job, wh ich, he took the test, but because he was a veteran of World War I, they gave him extr a points so that he Œ he was one of the chosen. Otherwise, he would have had to wait for years in line Œ Q: To get a job at the post office. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 74A: Œ to get a job at the post office. But his Œ his ex-extra points from being a veteran, made it happen quicker. Q: What was his job? A: He was a Œ a postal car Œ not a postal carrier, he was a substitute postal carrier. He only made money when he was sent out on a job. He sat in Grand Central Station waiting for a 59 cent an hour assign ment. But those were Œ it was the great depression. This is 1933 Œ ™32 - ™33. So he borrowed money from Œ his father died, and left a little bit of money to him and siblings, and he bother Œ borrowed some of the money from siblings, and he went over to get us, to save us from Hitler, or whatever is gonna happen in Europe . I don™t know that he specifically decided that he was saving us from Hitler, I think he was just simply getting very lonely after all these years. This second time, we were in Lithuania for four years. First time, one year, this time, four years. So he wou Œ I Œ I was Œ we were living in Kovno at the time, or the Œ the suburb of Kovno , called slub Œ Sluborda (ph). Q: Slobodka, mm-hm. A: Slobodka. And Slobodka was essentially a Jewish enclave. Q: Poor. Very poor. A: Very poor and Jewish and with yeshivas and syna gogues, and later became a concentration camp when the Germans came in. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 75Q: A ghetto. It became a ghetto. A: A Œ a ghetto. Q: Yeah. A: But sort of like a concentration camp. You couldn™t leave it. Q: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. A: So my father came and we got a notice from our Œ from relatives to Œ to come in and visit them. Their name was the Simonses™ and they lived in Kovno proper in a very nice place, with a courtyard and wagons and horses, and very nice. So they used to invited us periodically, and feed us. And we always looked forward to that. And we had a couple of cousins there, too, relatives of my ma Œ my mother™s. So, we arrived there and my cousin takes me and Harry into another room and says, look who™s here. And it was my father, whom we hadn't seen for three and a half years. Well, it was a shock. I mean, he embraced both of us, and it was very shocking. And he Œ then he told us, he sa id, I™ve come to take you all home, and let™s go and get your mother and the younger brothers, David and Bernard . So we went there, and they had a bi g discussion which I Œ we Œ I Œ we didn™t listen to, they held it in private. And finally they came out and they had an agreement, and the agreement was that he should take the three older boys to America, and leave the youngest one with her, and she™ll join us later. Well, I don™t think she ever had any Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 76intention of joining us later, she Œ we went to America with my father, and she returned to Zarasai from Kovno from Œ Q: With your youngest brother. A: With my youngest brother. And Œ and th at™s the last we ever saw of her. Q: Now this is what year? A: 1933. May of 1933. And the reason I reme mber that so well is that when I came to America, I had to be put into school in Œ it was May, it was still school. Q: School time, yeah. A: So Œ Q: What about your brot her? Did he ever Œ what happened to him? A: My youngest brother? Q: David, mm-hm. A: Now we go back to my fa ther™s caring. When Œ when my father brought us back to America, he o Œ he obviously couldn™t take care of us. He was a substitute postal carrier. He took me to live with him in a furnished room. My Uncle Harry and my Aunt Pauline in Brooklyn took my brother Harry in. And Bernard, the deaf mute, was put into the New York School for the Deaf, which he never stopped crying. Q: Oh, the poor fellow. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 77A: It was so sad, because he had grown up with us through thick and thin in Lithuania , and we™ll Œ had our own language. He didn™t know sign language or any of that, he knew our language. But things settled down a bit, and throughout my school days, every Friday I went to the New York School for the Deaf to pick Bernard up and bring him, and we all slept in one double bed, my father, Bernard and I, in a furnished room. And then on Monday he had to be Œ no, Sunday night he had to be taken back to the New York School for the Deaf. And that™s how we lived. But now going back to my father™s caring. He took care of all of us. He did. He checked on Harry , who was living with my Œ his brother, and he Œ for the summer he sent me to li ve with his sisters in South Fallsburg , and it was a wonderful treat for me, because South Fallsburg was as close as to Zarasai as you could get, surrounded by rivers and lakes. Q: Where is it? What state is it in? A: It™s in new Œ upper Œ Q: Oh, it™s up near Œ A: Œ in the Catskills. Q: I see, okay. A: Catskill mountains. Q: That™s why I didn™t recognize it, yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 78A: Yes, Catskill mountains. We had rivers and la kes and fishing, and everything that I had in Lithuania . And I had cousins, and I di d everything with them. And then, much later on, in s Œ when the war was already starting, and Œ Q: 1939? A: 1939. My father made arrangements for a young Polish man, who was emigrating to the United States Œ he must have done this through HIAS, or one of the Hebrew organizations, or Jewish or ganiza Œ I think it must have been HIAS, but I™m guessing. He arranged for this young Polish man, on his way to America, to st Œ to go to Zarasai , and to go to the address where my mother was living with ber Œ with David , and tell David that he has tickets for them to go to America. And I guessed they must have discussed the fact th at if he told his mother, she wouldn™t let him go. He was 14. So they kept th e secret, and he wound up on a train to Memel. Q: Klaipda, yeah, the port city. The port city, mm-hm. A: No, first they Œ they Œ they wound up first in Œ in a Dutch city. Q: Oh, then it wouldn™t be Memel, that would be further west. Memel is what Œ in 1939, March 1939, it had been part of Lithuania and then Hitler took it back, right after Czechoslovakia Œ A: Right. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 79Q: Œ he took it back. A: It wasn™t Memel, it was Œ it Œ it was a Dutch city. Q: Okay. A: And the reason that I re Œ now remember that it was a Dutch city, is when the Œ this Polish young man and my brother went to the hotel to Œ to a hotel, to stay til their boat left in Antwerp, they were told n-no Jews. By that time the Fifth Column of Germany had already invaded the low countries of Holland and Œ Q: Belgium and Œ A: Belgium and Holland. And they couldn™t find a place to stay, so they made their way to the port city, and just went looking for the Œ their Œ Q: Could it have Œ could Hoek von Haven Œ could it be Œ there™s a Œ a town called Hoek von Haven or something like that. A: I don™t know the details, but I Œ I do remember one fact that Œ that I think may stir something in your mind. They were on a train from the Dutch city that they had landed in, they needed a train to go to wh ere the boat was. When they got on the train Œ and I don™t know where the train was going, but it was filled with German soldiers, and my brother told us that he started speaking Yiddish, which he was fluent in, to the German soldiers, and they shared their lunch with him, and with the Polish fellow. They thought he was speaking some kind of Œ Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 80Q: German dialect. A: Œ germ Œ German dialect. And they all got along swimmingly, and they safely got off the train to where they were going to catch the boat, and eventually they did Œ they must have had to go to England though, to get on a boat, because they came over on Œ my father had ticke ts for them on the German Lloyd line, but they couldn™t be used, so they had to go on a different boat. Now, we were switched Œ originally we were switched from a German boat to the Gripsholm , which was a Swedish boat. But I don™t know what Œ Q: That was in 1933. A: In 1933. Q: And would have that been for political reasons, because the Nazis were in power by then Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ and they weren™t going to take Jews. A: They weren™t going to take Jews on their German Lloyd line boats. Q: Okay, okay. A: So we sw Œ we switched to the Gripsholm . Q: Okay. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 81A: And that was a wonderful trip, wonderful. And Œ but now, my memory is sort of Œ none of this was written down, so my memory is getting a little shaky with my brother™s experiences. I remember he told us all about this, but that was in 1940, or 1939, 1940. I can™t even remember Œ Q: And 75 years later we ™re asking you details. A: I Œ I Œ the Rotterdam, I think he was on. Q: Ah, okay. A: I think it was the Rotterdam. But he Œ he and the Polish guide were Œ just barely got onto it. They arrived late, they bare ly got on, and so he arrived here, and unfortunately he brought Œ he brought his Œ the Lithuanian winter with him, in the form of rheumatic fever Œ Q: Oh. A: Œ which he contracted in Zarasai . Q: Yeah. A: That™s why earlier I said, two of my brothers got sicknesses from winter, that™s all, it™s Œ and Œ and Œ Q: They™re cold winters and they™re damp winters. And it Œ A: Damp and cold, yeah. Q: Yeah, yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 82A: Everybody was a little sick. You know, you just couldn™t get enough heat in the houses. Q: You know, but it really does speak to the extraordinary devotion your father had. For somebody who was earning a living as a substitute postal carrier, to Œ to care and borrow and Œ you know, hi s own career, such as it would have been, was kind of shattered. A: Yeah. Q: But to care to that extent, that even if he had nothing, he was going to get his kids out. A: Oh, he gave us everything. He Œ he even eventually got a Œ he was still in the post office, he™d never le Œ ne ver got out of the post office, but he did take the test to become a regular, so he had a regular sa lary, not just a pick-up salary. Cause he was a temp really, before. So now he was Œ had a regular salary, and he got a small apartment, it was a Œ a one bedroom apartm ent, but we used the living room as a bedroom also. And he Œ he installed me in to that apartment, and of course, every Friday I™d pick Bernard up and brought him to that apartment. And Œ and then later on David arrived, so he Œ he ministered to all of us. He didn™t let a single one of us down. And when David was in the hospital with his rheumatic fever bouts, my father was there all day long. Certainly on his day off. And on his work days he Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 83came up as soon as he could, skipping dinne r and just going straight to the hospital. No, he was Œ he was a devoted father. There™s a lot he couldn™t do for us, but I™ll even tell you this little anecdote: I had Œ I had to cut class in the high school in music and art, a class that went on beyond the school day, which required us to go to a museum, a art museum, and I cut it, and I went to pick up my brother Bernard , brought him home. Subsequently, I was call ed down to the dean™s office, and was reprimanded, and I explained why, and th e dean was sympathetic, but she sent a note home to my father that I™d Œ it was her duty to report that I had cut a class. And my father gave me a note to take back to her. And she called Œ and I met with her, and I sat with her and she opened the letter that my father sent, and it said, how do I know where he was? You see him more ofte n than I do. But he Œ he was going to ride herd on me, you know? It™s Œ Q: Yeah. A: And Œ no, it was at that point that I explained to her what it was all about, not before. I said, well, Mrs. Dorkin(ph), let me tell you why I cut the class. I have a deaf mute brother who is waiting at the gate for me to arrive, cause he is dying to be with us, and I can™t Œ Q: Leave him there. A: Œ be late for him. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 84Q: Yeah. A: And she said, don™t worry about it, neve r happen again. You don™t have to ever worry. So, you know, it™s like a soap opera. Q: Well, it™s Œ it™s Œ A: But it™s real life. Q: Yeah, it™s real life, and when you hear of Œ this is al so real love, you know? It™s real devotion. It is when you sacrifice because they™re your kids, and they come first. A: Yes. Q: And Œ A: My father did that with whatever means he had. Q: Yeah. A: And sometimes he had no means at all, and he borrowed money, and hopefully he repaid it, and I™m sure knowing him, he would have. So Œ Q: I mean, tha Œ I thi Œ I™m very touched by it. I really am. A: Yeah, well, when I think about it, I sometimes think, Pop, I wish you were here, just so I could show you what I™ve done. Q: Yeah. A: You know, that Œ I™m Œ that I™ve Œ I™ve followed your principles. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 85Q: Yeah. And that what he first Œ with Œ with the Œ with the funnies, you know, that it started with the funnies that he introduced you to? A: The funnies, the people in the funnies became part of our family. Maggie and Jiggs, and the Katzenjammer Kids Œ we identified with the Katzenjammer Kids, but the Maggie and Jiggs were real weirdos to us, because she was always throwing a rolling pin at Jiggs, which I couldn™t understand. It would have killed him. Q: Yeah. A: But no, it Œ it™s Œ he created Œ he Œ he di d create in us, a desire to be something, succeed at something, to follow our hearts and our Œ our imaginations and our creative impulses. He had them, but he had to subdue them in order to be loyal to us, and take care of us. He never let us down. I can™t remember him ever letting me down. Q: That™s amazing. And that™s a wonderful tribute. It™s just Œ it™s just a wonderful tribute. A: And we had our argument s, and we Œ I was Œ at tim es you can™t help Œ when you™re a callow youth, you can™t help be a ca Œ but be a callow youth. And I would Œ I would say things to him like, you won™t let me have that white sweater, so I can wear, you know, the letter that I won in basketball. And he™d say, get a job after Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 86school and get yourself a sweater. And I said, the other kids parents pay for these things, and then we™d get into a Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ squabble over it. But I, of course, with the benefit of time, I realize that he had enough on his plate that he just couldn™t ca rry off everything. He Œ looking back, he did more, I think, than most people would ever do. A majority of people would not Œ they would have given up. Q: Yeah. A: They mu Œ they Œ even good people would have said, I can™t Œ I can™t handle this. I can™t raise four little boys by myself, and take care of all their needs. I don™t know that I could have done that. Q: And first of all pull them out of Europe. He pulls you all out of Europe. A: He pulled us out of the Holocaust. Q: Yeah. A: I mean, you know, when he came ove r, people were not able to escape the Holocaust by then. 1933 was a rough time in many parts of Europe . I mean, he was a bit prescient. Q: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 87A: I mean, he beat Œ he beat the Œ the system, because it wasn™t, I think, until 1936 that things started to get really bad. Q: Well, in Germany, it was, of course, some people i-i-in Germany, as Œ as you probably well know, the depar Œ the de Œ the Œ amongst Jewish families, the question of to leave, to stay, should we le ave, can we ride this out? If we leave now will Œ what will we lose? You know, all of that. A: Yes. Q: Some people left earlier, some people left later, some people left in 1940, almost unheard of. A: Yeah. Q: But Œ but this Œ this whole question became very relevant after Hitler came to power, and from other countries, like Lithuania, it was Œ it were Œ other Œ there were other issues Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ that came up. But it was Œ then, it would have been Œ you know, when I™ve interviewed people who were Œ it would have been 1940 Œ 1941, that™s when the cutoff is, you know, that you can™t leave, because the Germans have come in. A: Yeah. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 88Q: And before Œ so, but let™s go back to Œ let™s go back to your mother. When you leave in 1933 to go back with your fa ther, is that the last time you saw her? A: That is the last time I ever saw my mother. We did get a couple of pieces of mail, and very warm, loving letters plea ding with us not to forget her. Very touching. Q: Any explanation? Was any explanation ever given to you why she did not come to the United States again? Why she stayed? A: None that I know of. I have never hear d any explanation. The Œ the counterpoint to what we were talking about, my father™s loyalty, and his dedication to saving his children, the counterpoint to that Œ to that puzzle is my mother not seeming to care. I mean, you would think that she would have rushed Œ she would have written letters to my father Œ she could have communicated, there was no question about it Œ and saying get me out of here, I want to see my children. Now, the Œ the only thing I can conclude is that there must have been some kind of mental breakdown, which would be understandable, certainly in the co Œ in the context of her letting her husband take three children away, and eventu ally losing the fourth one as well. So, I could see a Œ a breakdown, but I have no Œ I tried, through the Red Cross to Œ to Œ I wrote to the Red Cross and asked them if they had any kind of way of tracing someone in Lithuania , and the answer I got was basically that while the Germans Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 89kept meticulous records of everything, wh ich is typically German, the Lithuanians did not keep records at all, she s Œ they said. So I didn™t turn to the Holocaust Museum, I thought about it many times. But I wonder if the Holocaust Museum might have a record of what happened in Zarasai , and Œ Q: Oh, what happened in Zarasai , we probably do, and we will see ho Œ what we could supply. But for this interview, it is that you™ve never f ound out. Is that Œ A: I never found out anything. Q: So, do y Œ and was it a handful of letters you got sinc e 1933? You know, between the time she could write, until the time she could not write any more? Was it once a month, like you said Œ A: No Œ Q: Œ your father would send you something once a month when you were in Zarasai . A: I Œ I don™t recall getting Œ I Œ I think we got one Œ one thing that Œ there™s a little bit of a mystery here. When my book was being done, I Œ I received a package from my cousin in the Catskills with Œ whose family I had lived when I was a bo Œ a little boy, and Bernie sent me a package that his parents had left behind when they died. And one of them contained a whole bunch of photographs of my mother and father, including my father in uniform. These were things that ma Œ apparently Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 90wound up in my father™s sister™s hands. And there was also a picture of my mother, and written on the picture wa Œ back of the picture was Œ it was in Lithuania, and it says, do not forget me. That was where that came from. So there were mix Œ a mixture of Œ of artifacts, but I have no dire ct mail, nothing that I can recall that she wrote directly to us. She might have written to my father, she might have written to her sister, or other people, but I have nothing. I don™t recall anything. Q: It™s quite a gap. It™s quite a gap, you know. A: It is a gap there. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. And you™d think something woul d have happened after she lost my youngest brother, when he wa s wi Œ whisked away by Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ this fellow who brought him to America. No, it™s all a mystery. Q: Did you think about it much over the years? A: Yeah, I think about it periodically. It™s Œ it™s unfinished Œ it™s unfinished, important in Œ life story. But you know, ou r defenses rise up. You Œ in order to survive, you can™t dwell on Œ on horror of the past, or a-any Œ anything. You just have to move on. And so, that ™s been my defense, I Œ I just move on. Fortunately, my father didn™t have that attitude. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 91Q: Well, you know, it sounds to me like you lost your mother mo re than one time. You lost her in a very personal way, as a family, as a mother, and then you lost her because there was the Holocaust. A: Yes. I had heard that, lik e in all the countries of Europe, and that includes Italy and Spain and Bulgaria; and you just name them all: Hungary , Romania , they all had local Nazi sympathizers. And so the Œ the story I heard was, once the Germans came in, even in a small group, and empo wered the local se Œ sympathizers, they had people joining their group, local bi gots, anti-Semites, or what have you, opportunists, and they just did what the Germans wanted them to do. Q: It did happen. A: That happened. Q: That happened. A: Yeah. Q: Now, had you heard about that in general, or about your mothe r™s pi Œ situation, or Zarasai in particular. A: In sizi Œ yes, I heard about Zarasai . I can™t remember fr Œ exactly from whom, but the thing that I heard about Zarasai was the main road out of town was cut off, so that the Jews were trapped with no Œ Q: In the town, mm-hm. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 92A: Œ in Zarasai , with nowhere to go. And then they were all rounded up and taken to the woods that I loved, where I used to get my fishing poles, and pick strawberries, the little ones. Q: They™re delicious. A: They™re wonderful, the little, tiny things. And we used to get baskets full of them. And well la Œ you know, it was like Huckleberry Finn, I™m te Œ I™m telling you, Tom Sawyer . And we lived the good life when Œ you know, when we were able to go to these things. So th-the story is that they cut off the ex it from town on the main road, and then rounded them up and took them to the woods and killed them. And this di Œ not only happened in Lithuania , it happened in Poland, it happened in Hungary , Romania, Yugoslavia , every Œ you know, everywhere. It™s a strange kind of opportunism to curry favor by killing people, but that™s what people did. Q: There™s some things that we try to find answers for, and sometimes we find partial answers, but some parts of those always remain inexplicable. A: Inexplicable is the correct answer. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah, because we just don™t expect human beings to behave in an inhuman way, and Œ but they do, oth Œ if they didn™ t, we wouldn™t have any more wars. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 93Q: Well, you know, this is one of the re asons why earlier, when we were talking about relations between Jews and non-Jews, and whatever your personal experience might have been in Zarasai , I wanted to get a sense of how you viewed whatever was going on there, in the contex t of other places, because if Œ if the message is that this was just as normal, you had a normal kind of life there, as there could be in any other place, that means that Œ that means a very spooky thing. That means that you put the right kind of forces together, and these things can happen anywhere. They didn™t ha Œ genocide didn™t happen everyw here. It happened in particular places, within a hor Œ historical context, when there was a final solution. A: Yes. Q: But it™s the ingredients in the cauldron. A: Yeah. I think self-preservation is a consuming motivation, be cause you either Œ the thinking among certain people who are very scared of everything, if you don™t join them, you become the victims. You Œ your choice is to join the bad guys, or die as the good guy. Q: Oftentimes, that is how people saw things. A: Yeah. Q: Oftentimes Œ is that a full answer? A: No. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 94Q: I still think that there is Œ A: Well, I just can™t picture being with a large armed Jewish group, out to have sport by killing Gypsies, or some other unfavored Œ black people, you know. I Œ I just can™t picture even entertaining such a notion, it™s Œ it™s Œ it™s so preposterous. And yet, there are people who get down to where they say to themselves, if Œ if I don™t join that gang, the gang is gonna kill me, so I better join the gang. That™s how gangs recruit people, they threaten them. Q: Yeah. A: And I think it would be very easy to threaten a non-educated farmer in Lithuania and tell him, if you don™t get rid of the Jews in the next farm, we™re gonna burn your farm down, you k now. So what are you going to do? Q: Well, you know, that™s how Œ what the Œ that™s what we do when we don™t know Œ we suppose. We suppose. And it could very well have been this, it could have been, I want his cow, I want his Œ the one car that™s in town. A: Yeah. Q: It could be Œ A: It Œ Q: Œ it could be Œ A: It could be any number of things. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 95Q: It could be any number of things Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ but there is something different when a war comes on when Œ when you have a force that, you know, an occupying power that has this po licy. And so what do they do in order to convince you to take part in somebody else™s repression and Œ and annihilation? You know, how do you Œ how do you explain that? A: It™s Schadenfreude . Q: Yeah. A: Thank God it™s not me they™re after, you know. It takes a lot of courage to stand up with the persecuted and sa y, you want to do things to them, you do them to me, too. Q: Oh yeah. A: You know. So Œ but it™s Œ it™s Œ cour age is not an easy thing to come by. Q: No. A: And I don™t claim to have any of it. Q: Well, we don™t know what we™d be like in Œ in any sit Œ I mean, unless you™re tested, you don™t know how you™d react. A: You don™t Œ you really don™t know. An d that™s why I appreciate the Holocaust Museum™s efforts so much, is that it™s not Œ in my view, it™s not so much Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 96remembering the fallen as to hold a mirror up to humanity and say, you want to be like these people, you want a world that Œ like that to live in? It™s Œ it™s horrible. Let™s not ever allow this to happen again. And course it can Œ you know, of course today it™s Jews, tomorrow it™s black people, the day after it™s Chinese people. It Œ it™s always a Œ Q: Take your pick. A: Œ you can pick a victim anywhere you look. But no, we™re all part of the same race, we™re human beings and we need to treat each other that way. Of course, I™m only, you know, sounding off about something that™s Œ everyone knows is a basic truism. But it bears repeating. I mean, I™m not ashamed that I repeat myself with these kinds of things. Yes, we™re all in it together. It™s one world, we™re all brothers, we™re all eating Œ eating and drinking and Œ and trying to preserve things for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and the millions of others who are yet to come. And hopefully, by example, we can Œ by doing something about it, by at least talking about things, showing how bad things are not to be Œ that shouldn™t be repeated, perhaps someday it™ll happen, that people will no longer hate each other. Q: Well, the point Œ I think also, if we don™t do it, it will be a lot worse. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 97A: Yes, it will be a lot worse, because the world is becoming more crowded, and there™s less of it, because of climate change, which is encroaching on the lowlands. Islands are disappearing slowly, contin ents are shrinking and populations are growing, and food sources are becoming le ss abundant. And so we™re either gonna have to get along together, or perish together, eventua lly. I mean, I know a lot of people say I won™t live long enough to see the horrors of Œ o-o-of Œ of global warming. And in my case that™s certainly true, I Œ I mean, I don™t have to worry about it happening in the next 25 years, because I™m not going to be here in 25 years. But my great-grandchildren, whom I love dearly, will be here in 25 years, and I want them to have a future, as I want everybody™s children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to have. So that™s wh Œ that™s why we Œ we talk about remembering. Q: Thank you, thank you. A: You™re welcome. Q: I couldn™t have thought of a better way to conclude our interview today than that. I really, really appreciate it. A: Thank you, Ina. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 98Q: You™re welcome. And I™ll say with this, that concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum™s interview with Mr. Al Jaffee, on May 21st, 2016, in Manhattan , New York. Thanks again. A: Thank you. [break] Q: Okay, so we started talking about a few things off camera, that I really asked if we would be able to repeat on camera. So this is going to be an accretion to the interview with Mr. Al Jaffee on May 21st, by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and we were talking about Œ about legacies in some ways, so if you could Œ if you could give me a sense of what is it that you got from having lived in Zarasai that you couldn™t have here, and what is it that yo u got from here that you couldn™t have there? A: Oh, what an interesting question. I can quickly tell you what I brought from here to Zarasai , and how Œ how it helped me integrat e into s Œ z Œ the children™s society of Zarasai . First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a train, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobile s in their lifetime so far: they were six or seven years old. But there™s Œ there™s so much that never arrived in Zarasai for them. And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that arrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work. Q: The ones that terrified you so much. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 99A: Yes, the one that terrified me. And Œ but they Œ you know, their mouths would hang open, and they would ask questions: ho w fast does this train go, and is it above the ground? And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they™re known as the elevated tracks, and some are subways, they go unde rground. And there™s a new train every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids would say to me, how many trains are there? And I would say oh, there are Œ they go around the whole city, and it™s just a continuous train tr Œ bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them about trips I had taken in buses and cars a nd with my father. And air Œ airplanes that we watched take off and land. And they Œ th ey were staggered with Œ with curiosity. And Œ but then, I learned a lot from them. I learned how to Œ I Œ I didn™t know how to swim, so I learned how to make swimming Œ what do you call a Œ Q: A raft of some kind? A: Thing that you lie down on that su pports you in the water, and you Œ you practice swimming. Q: Oh well, it™s not a raft then, but I know what you mean Œ A: Water wings, or something like that. Q: Yeah, something like that, mm-hm. Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 100A: Anyway, I learned how to make so many things. We made our own toys, we made our own wagons, we made our own sleds. We Œ we Œ [phone ringing] [break] Q: So, you said you learned how to make things. A: The Œ I learned a lot of how you Œ in Zarasai you didn™t have Woolworth™s and other stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed. If you needed a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find out how to make it was to consu lt the local people. My friend Karowlka (ph) taught me a lot of things; how to Œ how Œ how to Œ I™ll give you an example of something Œ to go fishing was a Œ a very interesting occ Œ pri Œ you know, business for us, and Œ because the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that™s very easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that™s just the right length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that™s your fishing pole. Now you need fishing line. Well, you can™t use just anything. But there are white horses, and white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and there, and you braid them, and it turns into the Œ a-and then you Œ you have like a Œ maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now you have a terrific fishing line. The Œ the bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork, and you put a hole in the cork and you put the goose quill through it, and then you Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 101run your line through it. The only think you have to buy is the fish hook. Nobody knows how to make a fish hook. And the st ore always has fish hooks. So we went fishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and we ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also Œ you could buy sleds in the wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play Œ play with wood, and we would make our own sleds, they were simp le things, but Œ but we di Œ we didn™t bother wi Œ sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to buy sleds. But we made our ice skates. Q: You made your own ice skates? A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of wood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of iron underneath as Œ as a runner. And you put the straps Œ nail the straps to the piece of wood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with these things and had a wonderful time. So, we le arned how Œ we learned how to swim, we learned how to ice skate, we learned how Œ how to catch fish. In the wintertime we got Œ we got sp Œ poles that were simila r to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we put a Œ a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in the ice. So Œ but all these things were local lore, and you ask people, and they showed you how to do it, and then yo u did it, and Œ also, there were no street lights. And Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 102when we would go visit our friends at ni ght, you would overstay too long, and no Œ there was no one nagging you who said you better go home, it™s going to get dark and all that. It just got dark, and the p Œ the parents of our friends said, you better go home now. And now we got a couple of k ilometers to walk in absolute pitch darkness, imagining that there are wolves out there. So, you make a lantern. And it™s very easy to make a lantern, Harry and I made so many lanterns, all made out of little pieces of wood, you Œ and you Œ you go to a glazier, they cut you a little Œ a little rectangle of glass, and you slip it in Œ on thr Œ three or four sides of this little thing. It™s not easy to describe, but just Œ Q: But you made it, you made it. A: But we made it. And we felt very jolly marching home in the absolute darkness with our little lanterns. And we did this with everything. We did this for capturing fruit from trees. The same kind of pole that we made the fishing pole out of, also served to have a hook at the end that you could reach up and snare an apple. So we never went hungry, because the whole town had nothing but apple trees and pear trees and plum trees, and Œ depending on wh at time of the season, we could always get something to eat that way. And Œ but being creative, making things, making what you need instead of going out to buy it, was an experience I™ll never forget, and it has served me well in the rest of my life because before I go out to buy Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 103something, I think, what do I have around that I can make it out of? And when I had a house and a basement and a Œ and some t ools, I made a Œ a lot of things. I made toys for my children. I made, you know, all kinds of things. So I learned a lot in Zarasai , Lithuania, which I will never forget, and it™s Œ any time I™m feeling a little bit blue, with nothing to do, I think back to those days when I made all those things that gave us so much pleasure. And so Lithuania Œ for me, Lithuania was a wonderful experience. I Œ I enjoyed the country boy life. I mean, it was Œ it was just like Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn. Q: Well, thank you. A: You™re welcome. Q: Thank you for bringing it to life for us. Thanks again. A: My pleasure. Q: Okay. Okay. Conclusion of Interview
