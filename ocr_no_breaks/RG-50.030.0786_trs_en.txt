A: Oh, in Grodno . Q: So Œ A: Well, how could I tell you very much? Q: Well, I™ll ask some questions. A: Oh, okay. Q: Okay. So, before the war started, did all three of you live in the same place; your mother, your father and yourself?

What kind of a place did you live in? Was it a large apartment, or a house? A: The house was in a country where the Œ mother™s property was. That was outside Grodno . Q: Was it Œ did it have a lot of land? A: She didn™t have a lot of land, you know, ma Œ eight Œ maybe 80 acres or something. Q: Eighty acres? A: Something Œ something not Œ not very big, but she Œ I think she Œ she was the one that directed the arrangement for the g-gardens, and Œ Q: Okay. A: It was still the sa Œ somewhat in the process of being formed, anyway, at that time, and this is Œ here is the beginning of the war, too. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 10 Q: Yeah.

A: But I think it™s listed somewhere. I don™t remember exactly. Q: The reason I focus on this, because I want to get a sense of whether your mother™s family were landowners. A: Oh, this was the la Œ the la Œ that property was given by the government because of mother™s brother be Œ taking part in a Polish ri Œ let™s see, the rise of that territory, because remember, Poland was divided be-before that. Q: And divided in what way? A: Well, div-divided de-depending which Œ how shall I say? Which Œ there is a Polish word, and an English word, and I can™t Œ Poland was divided Œ Q: It was partitioned?

A: As far as I know, on the Œ it was Russian. Q: I see. And then, does that mean that your mother™s brother took part in some kind of battles, or some kind of Œ A: Well, he Œ he wa Œ he de-deserved some compensation from the government, because he put Œ he was in that category of helping the Œ those that fought for the liberation of Poland . Q: Thank you. That™s what I wanted to understand, how it is that he got some land. So that meant he fought for Polish independence during and after the first World War. Is that correct? A: Yeah, mmhm. Q: Okay. Okay. And so the land was then given to him. A: Well, th-the land could Œ given to the mother™s parents. After they passed away, they simply Œ he, and the brother died Œ Q: I see. A: And mother was the owner. Q: So does that mean she had no other bro-brothers and sisters, just the one brother? A: The all Œ sh Œ there was a sister also, that she also died. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 12 Q: I see. Do you remember their names? A: The Œ the brother was Valenti(ph), and Œ we ll, that™s what Mother told me, Valenti (ph), and the sister was Natalia (ph).

A: Well, she Œ are you asking me if they were planning to Œ to Œ to start the business together? Q: No, no. I am asking if you have any memories of what the land looked like. A: Oh. Q: That™s what I want to know. Did you ever go and play there, did you walk there? A: No, no. Q: No. A: Nothing, nothing. You have to keep on remembering that ™39, what the second World War, I was merely probably around five -ish. Q: Five years old? A: Six. Q: Yeah. A: Child memories. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 13 Q: I know. A: Don™t Œ I really recall almost nothing. Q: I know, I know. The Œ sometimes there™s one episode, or another episode.

A: Like a Dobermeyer (ph), but very small. He could put it in his pocket. Q: Really? A: It was that small. And anyway, that dog was my playmate from then on. Q: What was the dog™s name? A: The dog™s name was Figa(ph). Q: Figa(ph). A: Fig. Fig . Q: That™s sweet. That™s very sweet. A: Because he could fit it into his pocket, he was so small. Q: That must have been quite a present.

And when we da Œ when the refugee camps of the second World War refugees were dissolved, people were sent everywhere. We couldn™t go back because we were afraid we Œ the Russians would send us back to Siberia . Q: Okay. A: So Mother and I were brought to England , and Œ Q: Okay. I Œ we™ll get Œ we™ll get to that part of your story, but right now I wanted to get a sense of how your father looked. Was he a tall man, was he thin, was he dark, was he Œ Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 15 A: He was the average height. I don™t have any photographs, if that™s what you™re talking about, prior to second World War, because anything that was there, it was stolen, or ravaged, or Œ Q: Yeah.

She left me with some people, and she went to get the medical attention. And o Œ in the process of crossing parts of Grodno , you had watch out, as I said, dod the Œ dodge the bullets. There were wou Œ they were Œ they were still fighting, certain sections. Q: I see. A: It was very frightening, but other than that I can™t tell you, other than when it settled down and Œ and supposedly law and order was established all over again, and the Russian sys Œ system Œ Q: Was implemented? You know, was Œ A: We returned to the country home, and found that we didn™t have the keys to the house. We didn™t have simple things that ar e required to Œ to live. We were robbed. The house Œ Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 17 Q: So while you had been Œ A: Œ the house was torn apart. There was Œ there was nothing that we didn™t Œ Mother didn™t have a pot to Œ to cook in. Q: Who did that? A: Some neighbors returned some of the items that they thought we didn™t need again. Q: Who did the robbing? A: Well, th-the [indecipherable] the partisans, when the Œ the law cha-changed from Polish to Russian, then back to Œ to Polish. I-It Œ it was su Œ su Œ somewhat frightening, but we had very little that we could take with us, when they took us to Siberia . They were Œ Q: So was it Polish partisans, or Russian partisans who had robbed you? A: The what? Q: You said it was partisans who robbed your home, your country home. Somebody had come in and taken everything. A: Well, there were partisans ravaging the country.

The few ite ms that we still had were put on the sleigh, and we were marched off to the railway station. Q: Do you have any idea why they came to arrest you? A: You didn™t need that. The Russians needed free labor, and this was a free labor. Q: But why you, why your mother? I mean, what can a five year old child do with free labor? A: Well, that™s Œ you can ask. And I Œ I never had any explanation that was logical. Q: So you didn™t know. A: We didn™t Œ we didn™t participate in any political uprisings, or whatever, right now. We tried to simply live, and survive on what we still had. But the Œ the Russian command decided that they wanted additional thing, they wanted our labor force. Q: Well, one of the reasons I asked about the land earlier, is that sometimes Œ A: The mark? Q: About your land, how much land your mother had. A: Oh, that. We did-didn™t have much land, it was just like a small farm. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 20 Q: Sometimes the people who were deported, were those who had land. A: Well, th Œ th Œ there were, of course, some people that they Œ that Œ that did have, but we didn™t. Q: I see. A: Or, Mother didn™t. Q: So, did your father find out what happened to you? A: We didn™t hear from him. Q: Do you Œ was he deported eventually too, or does he Œ you Œ the next time you see him, he™s in England . Was he arrested by anybody? A: In Poland ? Q: Your father, yes. A: He wasn™t arrested, he Œ in Russia , about halfway through the war, Stalin and Hitler™s got at each other™s throats. And that time it was Œ you se Œ you were asking just now, he was arrested. He Œ he was with us, sent to the same camp. Q: Oh, so when Œ when they came to get you Œ A: To same Œ to the same camp by the Russians, but when the war ended, or we, in the Œ during the time that the Œ Q: Can I interrupt? I™m going to interrupt. Hang on just a minute. When the soldiers came, the Soviet soldiers came to arrest you and deport you Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 21 Q: Œ were you alone with your mother and nobody else? A: Nobody else. Q: So where your Œ your father was gone? A: Well, your father Œ my father was called to the army, and nobody could Œ could get communication from, because there was a break in communication Q: Of course, of course. But then later you say he was in the same camp with you. A: Well, that was in Siberia . Q: So what happened to him? How did he get to Siberia ? A: Well, the-they Œ they kee Œ when the Œ when the Œ after Yelta, he was Œ well, the me n who are called, they could join Polish units that were being formed to help Stalin [indecipherable] Q: That was in Œ yes, that™s in 1941. A: Yeah, that™s right. Q: So, was your father a prisoner of war at that point? A: At that point, what he was first ta Œ arrested by the Russians, but then the Polish units were formed, and supposedly we lost con Œ total contact with him. Q: I see. I see. I see. Okay. A: He was [indecipherable] he had to be in one of the units that were being formed to help Stalin at Yelta. Q: Yelta is in 1945. That™s Œ the Yelta Agreement is after the war. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 22 A: Well, this was Œ Q: Can we break for a second please? [break] A: What happened then, I don™t know. A2: Okay, so when she was arrested, it was my Œ they were separated, her parents. A: There was Œ Q: Correct. A2: So they were not together when they Œ she Œ they were arrested. Somehow he ended up Œ he was a soldier too, with that same Œ that her uncle Œ our uncle was fighting in. So he also Œ he would have been arrested for being a soldier in Œ in the Pilsudski™s army, essentially. And Œ and then, when he got to the labor camp, they were Œ they weren™t together, but they were there in that camp, but they weren™t together. And then, shortly afterwards, what she™s talking about, he Œ he got in Œ he went to prison, and then when Hitler attacked Russia, they were Œ he was let go, just like my father was let go, and into that Polish army. So she doesn™t really know how he got to the labor camp. Q: Yeah, that Œ but I was confused because he was with them you say, in the labor camp Œ A2: Mm-hm, for a very short Œ Q: Œ and yet, he wasn™t with them Œ yeah, he wasn™t with them Œ Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 23 A2: Œ for a very short time, but he wasn™t like in the same accommodation, it Œ he Œ he di Œ he Œ they Œ they were separated. Q: They were separate. Okay, fine. Okay, so let™s go back to the moments, and the Œ then the night where Œ where you and your mother are taken by sleigh from your home, with the few items that you have, and you™re taken to the train station. A: Yeah. Q: What happened then? What did you see when you got there? A: Well, you Œ they stuff you in a shelf -type wagons that they transport cattle in, and Œ and take you to Siberian wasteland. Q: But you didn™t Œ did you know that at the time? Did anybody tell you where you were going? A: No. You don™t get to Œ any kind of information, just to [indecipherable] did you ever see the film, ﬁ Dr. Zhivago ?ﬂ Q: Yes. A: Well, that Œ th-that scene when they were cleaning the debris from the thing, that was routine thing for the transportation. Q: I can™t imagine, as a five year old child, what Œ what kind of a feeling you had. Were Œ weren™t you terrified? A: What kind of what? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 24 Q: A feeling. You know, when you™re taken from the middle of the night, on a sleigh, to a train station. Were you terrified? A: Of course. I mean, th-the child, it doesn™t translate to them the same tune, it seems. The child Œ I could hold my mother™s hand, so that was a reassuring. But other than that, no. Q: Were there other children on the train? A: The wagons were packed, the whole train was like that. Q: Do you remember anything about the journey? A: The what? Q: About the time you were on the track Œ on the train, on those cattle cars. A: Do I Œ do I remember what? Q: The journey. The Œ the moments, the days you were on the train. What it looked like.

Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 25 A: Well, as I pointed out, that scene in ﬁ Dr. Zhivago ,ﬂ with the Œ that prisoner being shackled and throw a Œ cleaning the debris off. Q: The debris, mmhm. A: But other than tha t, it Œ we didn™t really [indecipherable] very much. There was a Œ this place that once we get part of the road, we had to go by sleighs. And it was a very stormy night, and we had Œ Mother had problem trying to keep me alive, because the Œ the sleigh kept turning over. It was very difficult for her. The driver di Œ wa Œ didn™t Œ couldn™t see very well. So Mother had to help out. But they di Œ got us to a place where they gave us some hot, washed down soup. But it was hot, so they gave us that. Q: And what did they give you to eat on the train itself? A: Nothing. Q: How did you feed yourself? A: So people Œ people had some supplies. Those that had it, got fed, and those that didn™t, had problem. Q: Did anybody die on the way? A: I don™t remember. Q: Okay. Okay. Do you remember the Œ the name of the place you were taken to? A: No. Q: Do you remember what it looked like? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 26 A: It was like a Œ like a army settlement thing. Sort of a camp that was no longer in use. Q: You mentioned that when the soldiers came to deport you, you heard the hooves of their horses, and they took you by sleigh. Does that mean you were deported in wintertime? A: Deported? Q: Taken from your home. Were you Œ was that wintertime? A: But who we talking about? Q: Yourself and your mother. A: My Œ we were there in the wintertime. Q: Okay. A: All the time.

I can™t Œ can™t Œ Q: Can we stop please? [break] So, people in the cattle cars, nobody fed them. If they had food with them, they were okay, if they didn™t have anything, they had problems. A: Yeah, well, I think they Œ they used the water that cooled the engines in the locomotives to make some broth or something like that, I think. So that was a part Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 27 of the, quote, food that we had. But in Œ in the wagon Œ in the cattle car s, there really wasn™t very much assistance, except guards to make sure that you stayed with the train, and Œ Q: Were they Œ would they shoot people? Did they shoot people if they tried to run away? A: I don™t think anybody tried to, but Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ they just had Œ th-there was a Œ one moment that I remember in the cattle train. We were passing certain points along the route, and all of a sudden, the whole train started crying. It was the border. And Œ and someone started singing one of the prayer songs. Q: So, when you were leaving Poland . When you were leaving Poland Œ A: Mm-hm. Q: Œ and you were passing the border. A: Yeah. Q: People realized it. A: Well, it was a very moving moment, but Œ Q: Yeah. Yeah. When you got to where you had to Œ where they took you, you were then taken by sleigh, and the sleigh kept overturning? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 28 A: Well, it Œ the sleigh Œ th-the Œ this Œ the Œ they had Œ that territory had very bad snowstorm, and we were right in the middle of it. But we had a Œ some kind of soup, I think, to Œ we were fed, a little. Other than that, I don™t remember. Q: When they took you to the place that had been an army barracks, you told me, yes, it had been some sort of military place, was that correct? A: Well, yeah, it Œ I don™t know if it was, quote, my Œ my label of describing it as a military place, but it was a Œ arranged sort of like the Œ like what you come across sometimes, the old, unused Œ no longer used military camp, or station. Q: And w Œ did Œ was it a huge place, and did you Œ was it a big place with lots of people in it? A: No, it wasn™t particularly lar Œ big place. Just a few barracks. Q: And you s Œ and then th Œ that™s where you had to live, was in those barracks? Is that where you ended up living, in those barracks? A: Ah, yeah. Q: Yeah. A: More or less.

A: Well, there™s plenty of wood, so you had to make your own wood. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 29 Q: Your own fire? Did people make their own fire, inside the barracks? A: Yeah, I think you could use the facility that they had Œ th-there were two camps that they m-moved us to, Mother and I, but I don™t remember very much about the Œ one of.

Did you go with her when she was Œ A: No, I was in a camp, but Mother had two, quot e, jobs in order to gi ve me sustenance. After work, she tended to Œ to my needs, and her own.

A: Yeah, yeah, well Œ Q: Was that it? A: That™s it. Q: That™s it. And then that™s why these units were formed. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 32 A: Well, that™s why the units were formed, and Polish government to Polish forces outside Russia tried to participate, and I Œ start these units that also helped some civilians.

A: They Œ we found out, or at least I was told that t hey Œ the residents of the camp found out, when this guy came in from prison, after he was released. Q: I see. So how did Œ did people then Œ let™s say they™ve known now that they can leave, but the Œ the guards don™t let them? Did they let them leave when they found out, or did they still say no, you can™t? A: Well no, you di Œ you didn™t say anything, I mean, they only Œ they™ll had to ad mit that you can le Œ go, and try and draw in some of those forming units, but then nothing was ce-certain.

Q: What did you do when she was at work? A: The what? Q: What did Œ what happened to you when she was out working? A: Oh, when she was out working, I was with the other kids in the camp. Q: Was there a school? A: I-I-In what Œ I remember there was some school, but the Œ that time that the weather was warm. Q: And when you were with the other kids, did you find playmates?

A: Well, I was picking it up, that Œ that which we Œ fell on the ground, so I could do it, but they Œ at one time they Œ they said that Mother was responsible for me Œ my stealing the goat. Q: Stealing the goat, or the hay? A: Stealing the hahay. And they sent her to Œ in the courts. She had to walk for several miles, I think, to the di Œ court station. Q: Where she Œ where you were accused of having stolen hay? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 38 A: She had to follow the telephone lines. That was the direction. Q: What happened? A: Well, nothing, the Œ the Œ the Œ the commandant assistant that took part in that part, at that particular project, didn™t Œ I t-told the judge that he would not take responsibility of Mother™s negligence, the Œ supposedly, at the same time, Mother had a like, little mishap, unfortunate accident, when a tree pivoted. They were cutting down the tree, and the tree pivoted, and instead of going east, it went west, or whatever. And Mother was in that area, and she ti Œ she froze, she couldn™t move. Q: The tree fell on her? A: She met Œ she must Œ of course she did. She must have [indecipherable] you know how it is when you are scared of something, whatever. And she fell between the piled up branches, and the branches saved her. Q: I see. I see. A: So she did it Œ the tree sort of was propped by other trunks. Q: So she was saved, but she was stuck? A: Was sure, wa Œ th-they helped her out after everything settled down, but it was a little difficult. Q: Were there any other such difficulties that she and you had in th Œ in that camp, either with keeping warm, or trying to get food? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 39 A: Well, that was always a problem. Mother pretended she smoked, and Œ the tobacco. She could exchange, some guy that stopped by there from time to time. Q: So she would Œ A: The what? Q: Did she Œ did she get tobacco as a ration? A: Well, this Œ this Œ she couldn™t buy tobacco Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ at the store. But she could also then take the tobacco to one of the villages that stop by, and they would give her potatoes or, I think Œ and I think it was mostly potatoes. I don™t know if there was Œ Q: So food. She would get food for the tobacco. A: Well, that was the Œ the way to get some food. [break] Q: To keep clean? You were going to tell me about keeping clean. A: Oh, to keep clean, the blankets or the clothing, we had to boil ashes with Œ in water, and it di-disinfected the thing that way. Q: You mean, you would put the blankets in the water, and the Œ and ashes Œ A: With th e Œ yeah, with the ashes, the ashes, the wood ashes. Q: Wha Œ what would the ashes do? A: Well, they Œ they disinfect it mostly. Q: Really? I never knew that. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 40 A: Well, that™s what we were told. I didn™t know any other way. The Œ there was also another meth od of it Œ we tried to fake out, or in somehow Œ but I Œ I don™t remember how they did it, but the barracks were infested with field lice. Q: With field lice, okay. A: And th-that was very annoying, what it Œ I don™t know if you are familiar what I™m talking about. Q: No. A: But they smell quite a-atrocious, and they Œ well, they Œ they are like lice. Like Œ like Œ Q: Were you able to Œ was there Œ were there bathing facilities? Was there a place to take a shower? A: They Œ they Œ no, no, no bathing, you had to take care of yourself. But from time to time, someone like got a [indecipherable] problem, they got a problem with some medical issue, and sometimes they would just send them to the camp doctor Œ doctor, but there was nothing else. Q: Now, I want to ask you about when your mother got in trouble for the hay that was Œ was for the goat. A: Mm-hm. Q: Did you actually take hay that you shouldn™t have, or was it somebody accused you of it? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 41 A: No, I did Œ I Œ this was something that dripped from the cart. Q: And so it was perfectly okay? A: And it-t-t Œ it was okay. Q: And somebody then just accused her anyway, of taking hay she shouldn™t have? A: Well, they Œ the Œ the Œ they wanted, I think to take advantage of Mother™s strength, and make her work a little bit harder. Q: Okay. Okay. Did she get a punishment for it? A: Well, I Œ I think she Œ she was Œ she didn™t get the full salary that Œ that, quote, she earned. Q: I see. I see. What happened to your little dog Figa? A: Oh, he got a Œ at the last minute, as the sleigh was about to start for the railway station, Figa jumped into the snow and disappeared. Q: Oh, so you had been taking her with you? A: We Œ we were sort of planning to, cause that was my one thing that I treasured. Q: Did you make friends with other people in that camp? A: Well, yeah, of course we did. [indecipherable] as much she had the Œ there was time for any, quote friendly relations. But if they had husbands with them, they sort of supplied some nourishment to the situation. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 42 Q: Yeah. And when you said your mother found out about these Polish units being formed, and she was going to sign up to be a nurse, and she arranged that you would be in an orphanage, would that have been staying in the camp, or would that have been an orphanage of Polish children moving with the unit? A: Oh no, it was being the same as in camp. There was Œ you couldn™t trust the Russian authorities, whatever. There were kids that were picked up by the railway stations and the other places, that spoke maybe Polish, but th ey Œ once they were taken to the orphanages, they disappeared from existence. Q: So it was not to a Soviet orphanage she would have gi Œ she would have left you. A: Well, it would have been the Soviet orphanage, but not for the Polish kids, so far. Q: Okay. Okay. I think we should break here.

And before the break, Mira , we were talking about your mother having learned that Polish prisoners were being released from the labor camps in Siberia . And she, as first finds Œ makes arrangements to leave in one kind of way, and then the commandants change, and then she tries another kind of way. And you two end up leaving with some other people on a wagon, going towards the river. And do you remem Œ can you tell me a little bit about Œ A: The riverboat, yeah. Q: To the riverboats. Can you tell me a little bit about that riverboat journey? A: Well, it was a little, I think, frightening to all of Œ in a way. But there was an incident where a chil Œ a girl, a young , young, I think may be younger than I, fell into the water, and they didn™t stop the boat, didn™t try to retrieve her. Q: She was just left there to drown? A: They just left her to drown. The body was dragged after the boat. Q: Oh my. Oh my. Did you see this?

A: Well, I remember having to wait for several hours, and I was go Œ got very scared. I was all alone. Th-the Œ the individuals from that labor camp had to register to do Œ fill out some papers, and it took quite a few hours to get that Œ to do that s-signing up, and to Œ to come back. I was scared that I would be left alone, that Mother was arrested. It was somewhat frightening thing, because I Œ I was by Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 45 myself. But before, there were other people around, but at that point, th Œ the people left, and they Œ those that were from our labor camp were trying to get those papers com Œ signed up and cleared. Q: Were you already off the boat when you were waiting for it? A: The Œ I Œ we were on the dock. Q: You were on a dock. Do you remember the name of that place? A: Oh, no, I don™t remember. Q: Okay.

A: To Œ to try to distract me from what was going on, what we were going through. Q: And she bought it for you there? A: At the onset. Anyway, Mother bought a doll at that place, and that Œ and that doll unfortunately, didn™t last very long. Someone stole it from me. It didn™t really mean very much, but well, that™s all mo Œ Mother could do Œ use to distract me and Œ not to be scared, or something. Q: Where did you go from there? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 46 A: Well, that was another place, I don™t remember th Œ the sequence now any more, but it was another place that collected, you might say, units for that formation of that army. And that was Œ Q: Mm-hm. And so that means you were amongst Polish military people? A: Pol Œ military people, mostly Polish. That what w e had to deal with from then on, for some time, simply bec Œ after finding out that we could leave th-the Russian free labor camps jurisdiction, then we could Œ we still needed assistance, so the army units were op en, fed some of the civilians. We got some food that way. Q: Oh, I see. So the Polish army units were feeding some Œ A: They started Œ they started these refugee camp centers. Q: Were you Œ how were you housed? Were you living in barracks again? A: In barracks, or we Œ th-the local housing that was available, some of them had, you know, specially the [indecipherable] then Œ that they had kibidszkys (ph), mud huts, with the mud.

But anyway, Mother and actually the Œ the man call Œ talked my mother into being brave enough, and my God, Mother was brave, she Œ she didn™t need talking into, but anyway, Mother decided to join them on that excursion of ge Œ helping ourselves from some Œ beets were stored, I think before the army, or something like that. Bec Œ just to store it, sucked up beets, because [indecipherable] Q: Other than that, were you hungry there? Were you hungry in this place? A: We were hungry . We were fed the beginning by Œ by some Œ I guess these were [indecipherable] or no, that™s my Œ maybe that was a little later, but at one point in our journey going south i-in Russia , we would get lepierszki (ph). Lepierszki (ph) was something like a deep dish pizza. Q: Really? Uh-huh, with Œ with tomatoes? A: But it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t filled with any, it was just a loaf like that. Q: I see. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 48 A: And they eat it with li Œ I don™t know that th-they have had something that they Œ they were eating it with, but they gave some to Œ to the prisoners.

A: Well Œ Q: Is this like a flatbread that you™re talking about, it was a flat bread? A: It™s not flat. It was something like a Œ a bread that™s thick, but it was a-around, it was in a Œ in a round form. Q: Did you get sick in this place? Remember you told me earlier you got very sick when you went south? A: That™s right. First of all, th Œ someone caught something that registered very high temperatures. And she wa Œ she was taken to the hospital. This was in a, quote, mud house, in a kibidka (ph). And they were taken to the hospital, which was several miles away, but you could get some assistance. And they Œ the individual, after some time, came back and at that point, two other people and myself caught Œ had the Œ it was typhus, or something. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 49 Q: Ah. A: It was the rather serious problem, and anyway, the Œ Mother suffered quite a bit. Q: Did she catch it? A: She Œ she didn™t Œ she didn™t have anything to Œ to give me, or to Œ to ca Œ the food was bad, the medical attention was normal for that particular area, but we were already rather weak. We didn™t have enough nourishment to Œ I g Œ at that hospital, they Œ like heating was bad, there were windows that were broken. Mother was scared I would get pneumonia or something, and that would be the end. And she visited me. She had to work most of the time. So Œ but I managed to get out. Q: So you Œ you got better. A: After later on, Mother got it. Q: Really? A: So now we had the same problem. Q: Did Œ was this in the area where the Polish military units were being formed? A: Well, it was in that general area. There was a push of units in the camps, going south. So the next one would be out of Œ out of Russia, was the Caspian Sea , we were taken on the boat, we went Œ ended up in Persia.

Over there, I don™t remember very much, at the time, but later on, in that particular area by Persian Gulf , I saw the submarine that was supposedly the remains of a German attack. Q: Oh really? A: There was a sudden warnings and re Œ regarding Œ warning of the danger, or Œ to wear ja Œ lifejackets, because the boat might be bombed, just like the Œ the other. Q: So you had to wear those lifejackets, mmhm. A: [indecipherable] sticking out from the water. Q: How were you able to get on these transports? A: Out of what? Q: How were you able to leave Russia , and the sov Œ well, not Russia , but the Soviet Union ? How are you able to leave there, because neither you nor your mother were military people. A: Well Œ Q: How were they Œ how were you accepted to go? A: Well, that just Œ that Œ they Œ they made arrangements, once the Œ the people got to the southern point, they made arrangements to get to Persia , and then to Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 51 some other Mediterranean Œ near Mediterranean area Œ points.

Well, I know that per Œ prior to Œ to getting to Persia, I had to walk a stretch of si Œ I don™t know, two sa Œ se-several miles, but I don™t remember how much. But I remember it from the fact that my shoes were stolen. We had to walk on sand, and this was very hot sand. And I suffered something ou Œ terrible. I would step a few steps and Mother had to put something on the ground so I could cool my feet. Q: Oh dear. So it took a long time? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 52 A: Well, it took a long time. Q: The Œ it seems that people were doing a lot of stealing. You Œ A: Well Œ Q: Œ lost a lot of things.

A: No. The Œ he Œ this officer did not come up to me, but i Œ sort of examined me, looked at me. See, later we found out he had two daughters who were my age, more or less.

A: Well, they put us in buses, and some crazy drivers started driving crazy way on Œ in the mount Œ very mountainous area. Q: Oh, you mean in Persia ? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 55 A: In Persia , yeah, the Œ the Œ the drivers smoked this Œ some drug, whatever. And really, there were precipices right next Œ next Œ the straight wheel. Q: Oh my goodness. A: And you Œ you would Œ you would swear you™d fall through and it was sort of frightening, but Œ Q: But you™d been through a lot of frightening things. A: Well, my mother tried to, like all the other mothers tried to quiet the kids, by reassure them. Q: And by this point, how old were you? A: [indecipherable] I wouldn™t be Œ I would be about 11 Œ 10? Q: How long did you stay in Persia? A: I think we were there about two years, Teheran . Q: What was life like for you in Persia ? A: Hm? Q: What was life like for you there? A: We Œ there was no difference. We were refugee camp. Q: Was it a Œ A: They dumped us here, then they dumped us somewhere else, and so on, so on. They did the best they could, maybe. Q: Was the food Œ did you Œ did you get enough food? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 56 A: Well, we had a reasonable amount of food, I suppose. Q: And what about your mother, was she working? A: Well, in Persia she started work as a nurse. Q: Okay. And Œ A: With the Œ with that Œ that camp hospital, whatever. Q: Did you Œ what were the facilities like? Were th ey Œ were they different than they had been in the Soviet Union ? Were there places to take baths? A: I think they were something [indecipherable] we were in [indecipherable] tents and in Œ in Œ in [indecipherable] tents, and there were Œ we were told ththose were stables that the Germans kept the horses in. This was now a rather hot season, in a hot country. Every noon or so, there was a sandstorm. Q: Every day? A: Almost every day, and it was so unusual for us, we couldn™t breathe almost. We had to Œ we went th-the clean sheets that we had and covered ourselves and just stayed under the wet sheets, until th-the Œ the wa Œ storm passed. Otherwise, you could hardly breathe. Q: My goodness, what Œ what a situation. A: Yeah, well, we were there for some Œ for few months, I don™t know how long. But we were glad to move somewhere else. Anyway, that particular experience was a rather unusual. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 57 Q: So you didn™t stay there for a very long time? A: No, I don™t remember it would Œ all together, maybe over a year, a year and a half. Q: Okay. A: But you have to keep in mind, all the time listening to me, rattling on some Œ Q: You™re not rattling on. A: It Œ it was a Œ it was different, but Mother managed to get better at [indecipherable] assistance, because she was a nurse. And that made it that much better. Q: And, did you go to school at any point? A: Well , th-these camps always had provisions of some sort of school, and some sort of medical possible assistance. Those that had the relatives in the army had better sup Œ better assistance. Q: I see. A: We didn™t have any Œ any assistance, so Mother was the only one that took care of that. Q: It™s amazing Œ it™s amazing what she was able to do. A: Well, it was Œ it was difficult. Q: Yeah. Did she ever cry? Did you ever see h er cry? A: No. Well, I did, but it was in a totally different situation. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 58 Q: Okay, not in Œ during these years? A: No, no. Q: Okay. Did you ever cry during this time? A: When the Œ my feet were burning. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: What about when you lost the doggie? A: What? Q: When Figa ran away, did you cry then? A: The what? Q: When Figa ran away, did you Œ Figa, your little dog. A: Oh, th Œ when Figa ran away, well, I did cry then, yes. We were trying to get that little dog out, because it went Œ jumped into the very deep sn Œ rather deep snow [indecipherable] likely froze. Q: It sounds to me that you didn™t have much of a childhood. A: Well, we™re Œ we are born, and we die. Some of it has many turns and twists, and some of it is smooth. Q: That™s true. And so you had a lot of turns and twists, early on. A: Yeah. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 59 Q: What happened after Persia? After Œ you said you were there in Persia for a couple of years. A: Yeah, about Œ well, Mother and I were there, but the armies, th-the Œ the Fifth Army went to Libya and Syria , and ended up in wa Œ Egypt , and Italy . That™s how the armies went. But those that had some sort of contact with the Œ someone in the army, got like, some support. And those that didn™t, well, they had to do Œ were in like in Œ in a refugee, concentration camps. They had to put them to Œ in the places where they can get to them, or assist them. Q: And did you say you Œ you moved ca Œ from one camp to another within Persia? A: Well, in Persia, I think, there were two camps that we were in. Q: And then, how was it you Œ I assume you left Persia at some point. A: Well, th-they just took us south, keep on going south, from Persia to India . India Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ to Œ to England , and then over here. Q: When you first went to Persia, it was probably in 1941 or two, something like that? A: It would be Œ Persia ? Yeah, about that. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 60 Q: Okay. And if you stayed there a few years, so that makes it about ™44. Where did the war end? Where were you when the war ended? A: Well, when the war ended, exactly, I think we were in Œ in India . Q: You were in India . And how is that you were taken to India , why India ? A: They had open a Œ they had one of th-those unused camps, and the build Œ the accommodation was there, it just Œ it Œ it just Œ the money had to be allotted to Œ to feed us. Q: So was this a British camp? A: The Œ the Œ the Œ the camps, the camps were Œ this particular camp were Œ Mother worked as a Œ a Œ a Œ a Œ what do you call Œ not refu Œ I™m looking for a word that I can™t Œ Q: Yeah. A: Ref Œ no, it™s a refugee camp. I™ll thi-think of it when I go. Q: Of course, you always remember things once it™s all Œ everything™s all done. You™ll think of it a few hours from now. A: Orphanage. Q: She worked at an orphanage. A: The camp was mostly orphanage children, all s Œ s Œ part Œ part orphanage. In other words, they had only one parent. Q: Okay. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 61 A: Or t-t Œ they were missing two parents. Q: I see. A: But moth Œ Mother was working there, and there was Œ the refugee camps, they were trying to run permanent settlements, whatever, where there was a school, there was a church, and th-that kind of thing. Q: And was Œ was it Œ this run by Polish authorities, or British authorities? A: Well, i-it was run by Polish authorities, but th-the Œ they must Œ the funds came Œ well, they came from the government that was on temporary jurisdiction. Q: You mean, the Polish government in exile? A: The what? Q: The funds came from the Polish government in exile? It doesn™t matter. I was just trying to wonder, these facilities, who did they belong to? A: Well, I think to the country that Œ that they were in. Q: So, if it was in Persia , it would belong to the Persians, if in India , it belonged to Œ A: Well, I think so. I d Œ I don™t think that ever came up Œ Q: Okay. Okay. A: Œ as a question, but th-they were used as refugee concentration camps. Q: And tell me Mira , when you were in India , you said you went to school there, and there were churches to go to. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 62 A: Yeah. Q: So it sounds like a little bit of a more normal life. A: Well, i-it™s a Œ that™s what Œ what they tried. Q: How long did you stay there, with your mother, in India ? A: Oh, India , I think were about four years. Q: That™s a good long time. That™s a Œ what part of India were you in? A: Karachi to Bombay , along that part. A few places, but Œ Q: Okay. A: We had ver Œ relatively little contact, or communication with the Œ with the country itself, because we were simply the refugee [indecipherable] Q: Yeah, yeah . And if you stayed there four years, that means that it was the late 1940s before you left, yes? A: About that. We left after the India received its changeover, and the Œ became not part of the English empire, but India . Q: Ah, so when the India Œ India became independent. A: Independent, yeah. Q: I see. And from there, where did you go? A: Well, England . Mother and I went Œ went to England to Œ to Œ then Danuta™s father and my mother married, and we decided to try out American soil. Q: And how old were you when you came to the ameri Œ to the United States ? Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 63 A: Well, I was college age. Q: Already college age? So that meant you were Œ like in the early 1950s, something like that? A: Early 50s. Q: Early 50s. And where was Œ where was Danuta born? In Britain ? A: In Britain . Q: I see. Is there anything else, Mira , that I have not asked you, that you think is important for people to know, about your story? A: There was an incident about the goats. After work Mother went to the edge of the camp, and cut down those young twigs that just sprout out leaves. And at that time she used to sing, she used to Œ to tell me Œ taught me Œ well, I guess, the poem. I d Œ I don™t remember the Œ that Œ the author, whatever, but anyway, we Œ we were playing, the kids were playing hide and seek or something, and I Œ I was with them. They started to go Œ go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem what Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, it was po Œ essential that you don™t shake the Œ the bundles, because the leaves would fall off, and the goats wouldn™t get any food. So you had Œ Mother make me be Œ listen very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-talk to the kids, not to go and play on Œ in the loft. Well, one time the kids made comments about this and that. Finally, Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 64 one said, oh, to the ghost, that they Œ that they heard noises, whatever, like finally one of them says Œ says, oh, if we ta Œ say a prayer, it will all right. Q: Okay, so they thought that Œ A: So we started saying a prayer, but the boy Œ I don™t know which prayer it was, but anyway, they started saying a prayer, and I was saying the same ti Œ prayer, but I Œ I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all those kids going up there. Finally, I decided not Œ not to say a prayer. Q: Not to say one. A: No – not to say a prayer. Q: Were you able to keep them from going upstairs to the loft? A: Well, he did – Q: So Mira , it™s okay. Again, this is something you™ll remember later. That often happens to people. A: No. It™s a Œ A2: You were wor Œ one or two words behind in the prayer, and they thought it was a ghost. Remember that part of it? A: The what? A2: You were saying it, the prayer, one or two words behind, and they thought it was a ghost, remember? A: Not that one, no. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 65 A2: No? Q: That™s okay. A: No. Q: It™s okay. Is there anything else you™d like to add to what we™ve talked about? A: Well, I don™t know, you™ve been very patient with me, but Œ and this is a Œ a somewhat unfair trial for me. Q: I can understand that, and I appreciate Œ I know that it has taken a lot of strength and energy to talk about. Thank you. Thank you for doing it. I think what I™ll do now, is that we™ll conclude our interview, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with you, Mira . So this concludes it with Mira Zimmerman , on January 23 rd, 2015. [break] Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 66 Q: Okay. This is the United Stat es Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Danuta Soletski (ph) Urbikas , on January 23 rd, 2015. And Danuta , I want you to tell us a little bit about how you are related to Mira , and how you have come to know about her story. So. A: So, Mira and I have the same mother. My mother met my father in that whole turmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp, and she and Mira were released from Œ well, they escaped actually, from the labor camp. And it was in Tatishchevo , near Sar atov , where was the first Polish army camp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't been murdered in the Soviet Union . So they met there briefly, and they actually met again later on in Jelibod (ph), which was in Uzbekist an, or I don™t know, it™s on the border, near Tashkins (ph). Tashkins (ph) was another area where the Polish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from Tatishchevo , or near Saratov . Q: Okay. So I would like to Œ for us to trace. I mean, some of the things that I asked Mira , she didn™t remember where she wa Œ you know, what the towns were, and so on. And tell me, how is it that you know all of these places? A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing up. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, she Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 67 agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on this project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the history. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you know, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who were aware of Œ of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been deported. Q: Okay, so I™d like to start from Œ from the beginning at least, but we™ll run through it, okay? A: Okay. Q: So, Mira was born in Grodno , and that was in what part of Poland ? A: That at the time was eastern Poland . Today it is Belarus , right on the border really, with Lithuania and Œ and not too far from where the current border of Poland is. Q: Okay. And from Grodno , do you know what deportation they were taken on? Was it the February one? A: The February 10 th one, yes, in 1940. Q: Okay. And where were they taken to? A: They were taken first to a camp at Œ across the Urals, which would have been technically Siberia . And I™m trying to remember the Œ one was Mikelinska (ph), do you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 68 Q: Okay. A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And then they were taken back to another camp near Perm , which is of Molotov. And that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the Œ in the labor camp. Q: So Perm was a pretty tough p lace. A: Mm-hm. Q: The Œ some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that you are familiar with, that you had heard about before? A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but Œ you know, these were things that were discussed, especially at Œ during holiday times, or whenever our Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, and they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my mother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very Œ you know, she Œ she wo Œ she went through so much, you know? Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I™m clear about, she had to work as a lumberjack? A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she was, you know, generally speaking, the Œ the Soviets took people who were Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 69 working in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And the people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was saying, there was no one else f Œ to work for them. It was just my mother. And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled, and Œ and yes, there was one occasion when she Œ I don™t know, you know, she was so tired by then, and Œ and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira , that she didn™t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And Œ and so this tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they Œ and watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the Œ the branches from this rubble actually cut the Œ Q: Broke the Œ A: Œ broke the fall. So she Œ she was in there, and they thought Œ the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the Œ of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. And so they got mad at her for Œ for, you know, doing that. And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working Œ fixing Œ changing the oil on tractors, and also filling Œ there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for that. But, you know, in the co Œ in the course of all of that, you know, she di Œ she Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 70 almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the Œ the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian™s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really Œ she kind of did things that didn™t help her, you know, and that™s another thing that happened. So when she went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were Œ they were just Œ you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn™t like her. Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this Œ how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay. A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten Œ like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was actually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn™t getting paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult. Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever Œ was she ever told why she was deported? A: Because she was a landowner. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 71 Q: That™s what I thought, that™s what I thought. A: And Œ and also, I think they may have also known that her Œ they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a Œ a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army. Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there™s the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials. A: Right, they Œ the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but they weren™t Œ they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped. Q: So tell me, this incident what Œ that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this Œ A: Well, that™s much later, actually. Q: Oh, I see. A: That™s much later. Yeah, at Œ when Œ when my mother and sister were escaped from the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga . And this is that Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 72 incident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they made it to Œ oh, now I™m drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk , you think? A2: Kra-Krasnovodsk . A: Krasnovodsk . And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I™m skipping something. There was a lo Œ there was Œ all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there Œ you know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And there was a huge mass of people, and they na Œ they didn™t know where to put them. So in the southern Soviet Union , they were traveling by train back and forth, trying to find a place to Œ to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that. And in that turmoil, that™s when they met my father again, okay? Q: I see. A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these resettlement camps, and one was in Teheran , and t hat™s where my mother and Mira were there. I™m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was many months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so, she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India , and there were there as Œ as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 73 being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation. Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense more of the geography. So from what I understand from you™re telling me, is that the camp they ended up staying in was bet Œ was in Perm , the region of Perm . A: Oh, the labor camp, yes. Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where they were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk , is that wh-where you were saying? A: They went to Tatishchevo . Q: Tatishchevo . A: Near as Œ Q: And what is Tatishchevo ? A: It™s a city or town near Saratov. Q: I see, okay, in Russia itself. A: In Russia , yes. Q: And it was in Tatishchevo that they met your father Œ A: Right. Q: Œ for the first time? A: Right. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 74 Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there? A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and he was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania . And then from there he was sent Œ Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern Poland ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes. Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania ? A: They were trying to protect the Augusta (ph) Forest canals, and Œ from the Germans, and they were Œ o-or no, maybe it was Œ I™m not sure now. I think it was Œ no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got Œ they got caught and Œ and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania . And from there they were sent Œ he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk . Q: Kozelsk . A: Or Œ or Kozelsk , yeah. Q: So he was a Russian POW? A: Right. Q: Okay. He was a Polish POW Œ A: POW. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 75 Q: Œ under the Soviets, excuse me. A: Right, right. Q: And Œ and he was not Œ he was not shot. A: No, there was Œ hi Œ at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these officers were being sent somewhere, but they didn™t know where. And he was taken, actually, to Œ they were going to build an airstrip or something up further north, in the tundra, and Œ at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point Germany had in Œ attacked Poland Œ I mean, Russia , and so they were camped there for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know, th-that Œ there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army. A2: Armestu (ph). A: It was ca Œ yeah, was Œ Q: Yeah, an amnesty. A: Œ the amnesty. And so then, from there, I Œ somehow he Œ you know, made his way towards Tatishchevo , or Saratov . Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time? A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and my father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles. A2: Well, no, he™s th Œ I was holding up a box, a Œ a Œ a matchbox of some sort. A: Okay. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 76 A2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa Œ a pile of rubles, or something like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or Œ or d-don™t have anything to Œ to Œ that I would be able to buy some food. Q: I see. Okay. A2: And he Œ he put some more of his money into the box, and gave it to me. And I refused to take it, Mother wouldn™t let me take it. A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember? A2: Yeah. A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and Œ and then you came back another time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something. A2: Oh, I think the Œ he Œ he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids some sugar, and some honey. A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the children. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that were the same age. I™m sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him, you know, of them. Q: I see. And did he talk about this Œ these stories as well, and this incident? A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did. Q: Okay, so when he met Mira the first time, and so on. A2: Mm-hm. Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 77 Q: And then Mira introduced him to your mother. A: Right. Well, as it™s Œ as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some kind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know, he broke rank and came over, and met my mother. Q: Okay. A: Our mother. Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo , you Mira , and your mom, went further south, is this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and forth? A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying to find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really, actually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was cold. By then it was, you know, November, December of ™41, and there was very little food, and my mother was Œ our mother was trying to find, you know, food, and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually much worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another Œ you know, to Œ to a resettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money Œ she Œ they say Œ I don™t know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him for s Œ help, because she really Œ they were so destitute, she Œ they had Œ they Œ their luggage was stolen, this is the Œ Interview with Mira Zimmerman January 23, 2015 78 A2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi Œ center office of the Œ of the forming units. She owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your father. A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I™m sure he collected from the other soldiers, of like 367 Œ A2: Twenty Œ 300 some Œ A: And it™s Œ 367™s the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my mother and her. This is when she Œ they were both sick. A2: Any money se Œ being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that. A: Yeah, it was Œ it was quite a miracle that that money got Œ and that really saved them, because they Œ at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and there was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just really very hard. Q: So it sounds like it was almost the first kindness that she had received Œ A: Well Œ Q: Œ from all this Œ from all of these experiences. A: Well, could Œ probab Œ the one that, course, stands out the most. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah.
