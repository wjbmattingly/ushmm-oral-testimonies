What would you want young people today to understand about your experience in Poland before the war, your experiences in Russia, and the things you learned after the war. Those are three distinct parts, but what would you want them to understand about each of those segments of your life? A: I don™t think they™ll ever understand, thank God, thank God. You grow up here, you just Œ sometimes I don™t believe that I could go o Œ throu gh the whole thing, yeah. Let Œ let me take the army. We have no beds over there. Straw on a piece of wood. And no underwear, in the same unifo rm you were sleeping and eating. When an inspection from the United States came, before he came there, everybody get a piece of white linen, put it over here, make believe we have a shirt. Yeah.

A: Yeah, it was not prisoners, it was Œ it was a torture. What it was is, I had 16 years old and 90 years old, all kind. This is Stalin had thing to scare people to talk. You couldn™t talk about Stalin bad thing. So to scare you , almost every month, or every week sometimes, somebody has to disappear from your neighborhood. So this is you keep your mouth shut. The way they did it, ne ver did Œ never arrest you at your house, or never at work. On th e way home from work, usually the girls [indecipherable] girls start to talk to you, or they just have to ask you something, in the police station. You never came back. Used to [indecipherable] I met them over there, you know, I was a good guy, because I Œ I was part of them, almost, but they didn™t know it. So they told me, one Œ a couple over there, from the wedding, they took him, for no reason [indecipherable] the people, just to scare. And then Œ Q: So they were just normal people? A: Yeah.

The lawyers can™t do nothing. If you tri Œ the lawyer will try to show you are innocen t, so you are against the government. So you™ll be punished. So you just staying there like a Œ like mummy, and that™s it. And listen. And this is the way Œ Q: Well, I understand what you mean by saying it would be good if they never have to understand it Œ that is young people. Do you think that then Œ I mean, it™s Œ it™s one thing when you have someone who™ s gone through an experience, there™s a cost in remembering, there™s a price to remember. Are you saying it™s better that people are never really informed of these things? A: Not informed, yes. But Œ but they wouldn™t understand you, because I don™t believe it any more. You had to go thro ugh, you know, because it™s a Œ impossible Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ to Œ to Œ to accept, not to be a human being where you are one. Treat you like a Œ you are Œ yeah Œ o-or in the army Œ no t in the army himself, in the toilets. There was a big hole with a piece of wood. And male or female, we all sitting together. Come on. Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 91Q: Yeah. A: So you Œ you Œ you are used to almost nothing. Q: It™s very hard for people who have not been reduced to almost nothing, to know what it™s like. And I suspect it™s very hard to have words to put to that experience. A: We were in the army, I told you [indecipherable] there, watching those prisoners. It was winter. For three months we didn™t had nothing to eat. No Œ nobody cared to get Œ get to us, so we finally yu Œ saw a field where the farmers took off their cabbage. Was no cabbage ther e, the roots. We dig it out the roots, nothing wash it [indecipherable] shanell(ph), they call shanell(ph) the uniform [indecipherable] this is the soldier. Q: Wow. A: [indecipherable] they just couldn™t understand, they thought that somebody make up story. Or Œ or like my brother [indecipherable] you know, the showers. Forget about shower [indecipherable] we had a Œ not a hole, a piece of stone over there, with a couple blankets hanging, they™re outside a fire. You put snow, and from the snow we get steam. And this was our shower. You didn™t get sick, you went without shoes, without the winter. This were your shower. Could you believe it? No. Q: No. Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 92A: [indecipherable] remember? Q: What was it like when you live in the United States? Does it Œ did it ever feel lonely that there wasn™t anybody you could talk about these things to? Or that Œ who™d understand. Not that you™d need to talk about it, but who could understand it. A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will understand, yeah. Not from the other side. This was paradise. It was Œ here, when we came, we just couldn™t believe it, we had the Œ we couldn™t believe it, we are talking with a nice human being, you kn ow. Thank God. Food all over. You don™t have to stay in line, like you used to. Q: That™s right. A: You used to stay in lines for hours, and then they ha ven™t got any more. Like I Œ I Œ I love watermelons. I says, for one week or two weeks I was living only on watermelons. I had no money, I had nothing to buy [indecipherable] the watermelons were growing over there, just growing, you know, wild. And this the only food what I ate. Q: Do you think Œ are there Œ well, here™s a Œ a question that™s a little provocative. Do you think that there are people who endured the Holocaust, who were never close to Russia at all, who don™t understand what you went through? Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 93A: I™m sure there are plenty of it. For one reason that I Œ I-I-I tried to understand, is it true? I Œ I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I™m still here, and I have a office, with kid, with children. How could I live? But yeah Œ I mean, you start to think, you go [indecipherable] details. You went through more than y-you could take, you know. Q: Do you have Œ do you have Œ sometimes Russian Jews who have emigrated to the United States have felt alienated because pe ople haven™t understood their experiences. There™s Œ I™m talk ing in the 70s, in the 80s, and the 90s and so on. Do you think there™s something to that? A: The worst thing is, if you can™t sh are with nobody. It™s always, you know, locked in the Œ in the Œ and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable] is it true? Some years, are you still alive, you know? So it™s very hard to tell my kids. Okay, sure [indecipherable]. You can™t. If you don™t go through, you don™t understand, yeah. Same thing with a patient , if you never have pain, oh yeah, don™t worry about it, couple minutes you™ll be fi nish. For you a couple minutes, but the patient is suffering couple hours. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand. Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 94Q: Did you learn something about yourself as a person, having gone through these things? A: Oh, a lot. I think a lot. I don™t know why, it™s all Œ in all of us. We afraid to throw out the piece of bread. It wa Œ it™s just, it™s too expensive Œ no, it™s not expensive, it™s Œ it™s bread, you know, it™ s Œ it™s something like a holy thing, you know. Q: Yeah. A: And then you did a thing for everything . Every step you™re doing here, you can™t believe it, that it Œ you Œ I used to Œ I here, free? Do whatever I wanted, you know. A-Alive. And to me at least, start to believe you have a God. You have somebody who does it for you. Q: So it strengthened your belief? A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more. Q: But somebody would say, if He was a God, how did He allow this suffering? I mean, it™s the perennial question. A: Yeah, everybody ask it. Q: Everybody asks this questio n. How will you answer them? A: You look for a Œ for wa Œ answers. You ask, maybe, maybe this guy did something different. Maybe this guy did some Œ something [indecipherable] to Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 95somebody, that™s why he ha s to be punished. Maybe. You don™t know. I never spe Œ spoke with God. I try. He has no telephone. Q: Or the line is busy. A: Yeah. Q: I don™t think the line is busy, but Œ but you mean, somebody who is victimized could be Œ could be responsible for that? They Œ they™re guilty of Œ themselves, of being victimized? Is that what you™re saying? A: Maybe. I mean, if you going back to God now, make believe. Q: Yeah. A: We don™t know why Œ you ask the same question. I was Œ I had the prisoners, I mean, medical thing, it Œ only killers, maximum, right. But the people there were 90 years old, 70 [indecipherable] never got sick. Why is this [indecipherable] die? That™s the question, who shall I ask? Q: Yeah, yeah. A: The same thing here, it™s hard to tell why. Q: But my question to you is more for those people who want to dismiss that there is a God, and say, if the Œ why Œ if there is one, why did he allow such suffering? And you say your faith was strengthened. How do you answer that question for them? Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 96A: Well, to me, what I went through is many miracles. Who else [indecipherable] miracle than God. Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through this. Wha Œ two slices of bread a day for two years or three years? Working [indecipherable] and Œ and it™s not that Œ you have to finish this amount. If you don™t finish, you can work all night. Othe rwise you wouldn™t get nothing. It™s not like eight hours [indecipherable] eight hours. Q: Yeah, it™s a quota. A: Yeah. So the Œ the Œ you had so many questions. [indecipherable] some are why. Why did this guy die, he was so strong, working with me? How come I am and he is alive? Why Œ you know, and it™s so many questions you can™t answer. Q: Yeah. A: And like everybody else, you have to believe in something stronger than you are. So where you go? Q: Yeah. To the telephone. A: Yeah. You can™t afford [indecipherable] the telephone. Q: Any final thoughts? Any Œ anything else you™d want to say for the kids, for the grandkids? A: I™m just Œ I just thank God they don™t have to go through it, and I have to understand. Thank God for th at. That™s it. And everybody, they don™t know what Interview with Paul Jonas May 3, 2013 97kind of country we have, really. You™re born in good, so you don™t know, the same thing. At home I didn™t know what the Œ wh at mean hungry. I didn™t the guy he is hungry, because hungry you don™t see. You see he is working, I am working. If he [indecipherable] know what hunger means. The same thing with this. I wished I never really understand it, no. Q: Thank you. A: You™re welcome. Q: Thank you very much.
