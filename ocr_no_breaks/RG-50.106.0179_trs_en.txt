And there was people with Œ with ta-ta-ta-ta-tata-ta-ta Œ the shooters with the Œ and the Germans say stay in line, or Œ we was back there, we was very back. So the first people Œ because I just saw that, I was not there, but I saw that. They sta Œ stand on th Œ on the ditch. On that side was the shooters. There was Latvians and Germans. And the Jewish people Œ yo u know, there is a mother with the child, and two little Œ every Œ the Jewish people have children, a lot of children. They stay, and the machine gun was tata-tata-tata Œ I remember this Œ the sound. The sound was tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata, and they was falling in that grave, half dead, half alive. The little children screaming, people was be-benching to God. Wa Œ be Œ woman was scr-screaming and yelling and crying. It is a mess, you know, that is just like Œ what Œ what can I feel? I feel nothing. I am like I Œ I Œ it™s like a joke, or something, I don™t know. But I did say Œ see that. But I was not on the grave. I was li Œ in the line, what was the line, I was very far. Til I came back Œ you know what happened? I was already Œ I remember one Œ one moment. I did have to take off my coat. Before, I remember my father, in the good times, he was ba Œ he bought me a wonderful pur Œ purple is my color, you know, I™m a Pisces, and purple is my color, and my coat was purple, and was new and wonderful. The Germans Œ and then Œ though it wa Œ was our Œ one place, all the coats must be in one place. The jewelry, what you have jewelry like this, everything in the box. So Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 30 ba Œ when you have a hat, is in a different place, the shoes. There was so many. Aga Œ how you call that in English? A mountain of shoes, a mountain of s Œ coat. And I wanted Œ oh yeah, already wanted to take, because the German said take off your coat and stay in line. And Œ and it was cold, and I kind of tried to take out the coat, and I couldn™t take it off, so I put it on back, and I stand wi Œ til our line was come, we are going to be dead in a minute. So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly, and so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two little babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know why I was always Œ use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I don™t know from where, I don™t know why, suddenly arri Œ arrived four Germans on horses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general , a German general. Not a Hakenkreuz , because some of them was Hakenkreuz , they were the worst. No Hakenkreuz , just German uniform. Til today I don™t know who they were. That was a miracle. And he said out Œ not ch asen, out, out, out, not chasen(ph), not chasen (ph). And Œ and the [indecipherable] stopped. And that general of the four horses say, women, if you are schneiderin in(ph) come to me, come to me, come to me. I need Œ I have a factory, and you can work as schneiderin in my factory. My mom grabbed me and my sister and screamed, I am a schneiderin , mine children™s in schneiderin [indecipherable] my life. We were Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 31 schneiderin , and Œ and there™s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on the grave, they was killed, in that particular time, in Rumbula , that was happened in Rumbula . That is the Œ the name, Rumbula , where the killing was. And that, I am the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have a little memorial there. So, how chasen Œ my mom Œ so we stay Œ we™ll stay with the officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom has both Œ both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we shall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group with about 200, or 150, I really don™t remember. The people know each other from a [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so Œ so was, we stayed there behind the four fe Œ horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these horses. And they Œ there Œ the uniform what the Œ the Germans has, was like Wehrmacht . This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz . I really looked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz . They was Wehrmacht officers, but the y was officers, definitely big Œ big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we moved. The other, they moved. He Œ we Œ he took it out of that. They basically save us, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on Œ this is the other group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the front, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because we Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 32 thought maybe this a good thing, maybe we™ll work as schneiderin , and that™s very good. So we walk and walk through the woods. It was all the same. They Œ they went this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we walk, I am from Riga , I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin (ph) prison, the name was Termin (ph), Termin (ph) prison, the name of the prison. The Œ the Œ that the Œ how you call that? The prison [indecipherable] get up Œ you know, it is from wood, such Œ with eyes that went up, and th-the Œ the horses and the people were standing here, with all these 150 or 20, I don™t remember how many, went in and Œ and this a [indecipherable] prison. I was never in prison, I didn™t know, but you know, you know how a prison looks, yes. But the four Œ the Œ the Œ this Œ the Germans on the four horses stayed outside. We never saw him. We never worked as schneiderinin (ph). Til today, I kn-know that they saved our lives, because they took us away from the [indecipherable] . Otherwise we Œ we stayed in the line, because it were only lucky we Œ we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be killed, like other people. So, now we™re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do, 150 people about, or 20, I don™t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get your own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn™t get that. They took us on Œ on top on the prison, with a open sky, and it was November, I remember that was November. It was cold. It was very cold, and it Œ the waywer Œ the weather was Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 33 wonderful, not snowing, and not raining. At that time in Latvia is always terrible snow, and terrible rain. Nothing. So, we sit all together [indecipherable] to each other because it was cold. So we just Œ the little group what was there, we were Œ how you call that? Q: On the roof? A: On a roof, on the prison roof, on top. There was no cover, an d we were so Œ the moon, the Œ the Œ the stars we saw. But here it was a open place, how you call that, it wer Œ I don™t know how you call. So we sit all together. And there is a other story. The story is louse. The first time I saw a louse on me. And this Œ you know, I have episodes to tell you.

They found the louse, they kill the louse. But I had Œ I saw a louse. So I can imagine that we all had a lot of louses. And that was not everything. In the middle of the night Œ so with Œ wi Œ we are no food, no nothing, we just Œ some Œ a fat Latvian was sitting outside the door to watch that Œ that we don™t do something. So, it was Œ because, now God loved us. Because I believe in God. I Œ I really start very religious after that. And that Œ the gi Œ that Latvian was standing ou-out watching that we are.
