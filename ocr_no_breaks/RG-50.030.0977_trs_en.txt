Q: Œ who Œ who write as artists, get co-opted, sometimes by regimes that don™t necessarily have the best purposes, and their art becomes, in some ways, propagandas Œ A: They exploited him, but the choice Œ but the Œ but the choice, they were not Œ not wrong. He was a revolutionary, and he was with the workers. Q: Okay. A: And that™s when the Œ at least officially, that™s what, you know, communists, socialists, supposed to be. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 14 Q: And did you Œ wa Œ did you learn about him very early on, because he was in the neighborhood? A: Yes, yes, from my mother. Q: Oh. A: Because he was the neighbor. Q: Okay. A: His mother already was telling, you know, about how Œ they were very poor, poor family, so when he was already 10 and 11, 12, they used to send him to Latvia to Œ to Œ to take care Œ to dur Œ as Œ well, during the summers, to earn some money, by working as a shepherd. Latvian farmers needed, and Œ Q: So, he was hired out? A: And the mut Œ and mother used to miss him so much, that he Œ she used to come to visit him. When she did not show up, she used to watch him from the woods when Œ the edge of the woods, that Œ so that she could see him, but he could not see hi Œ her. Q: Okay. A: Because she did not want that. Q: She did not want him to be able to see, mmhm. A: To Œ you know, yeah, to Œ to break his heart, so to speak. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 15 Q: So you grew up with this kind of story, her Œ his mother tells your mother, and it becomes known to you, about this Œ A: Yeah Œ no, farmers talk to each other Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and they tell Œ tell each other s-stories. They™re all there. Q: Yeah. A: The village where Œ where I grew up until age of seven, eight, was Œ all the 20 families were Œ were together. They were not dispersed like later it happened in ™27, ™28. Q: I remember reading that you said that was a great tragedy for the village. A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Yeah. A: Culture Œ culture and in many ways. That™s another story. Q: Yeah. A: So we Œ we knew each other, you know, we have Œ and we si Œ we got together every day, and we could hear them Œ them laughing, or Œ or fighting, and we Œ if the fight was too Œ too bad, we used to go, you know, my father used to go and try to talk. So it was part of the whole circle, and you have the idea, also. And we Œ we Œ and then we sang together, we Œ later, you could hear som ewhere, somebody sing Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 16 . But we did not Œ when they dis-dispersed the families into settlements, it was a completely different situation. Q: Well, from what I understand from the history, it was that there was a land reform act. A: Yeah, this is Œ oh, look at the Danish people, look at the German, you see they do very well, you know? Q: On single farm Œ single family farms. A: Yeah, yeah, that was the motivation. Q: And what you™re describing is much more the Russian mir system, where Œ where villages were collected in one place. That is, they lived in one place. A: They Œ they were not collected. They original, they grew from there, and the one, and then the neighbor, ah, I like you, I will be here, also, I will, I will ma Œ Q: Yeah Œ no, no, no, not Œ not Œ A: It grew. Q: Œ yeah, I Œ I used the wrong word. It was Œ it was natural, it was Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ not a Œ not a forced thing. A: Yes. Q: But that old system had people, the people who worked the land lived in an Œ in one sort of area Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 17 A: Yes. Q: Œ but the land was somewhere else. The land was not Œ A: Land Œ the land Œ each one had, you know, different spots there, and there, and there. Q: Tell me Œ A: Later they joined, they said, okay, let™s have each one of us should ha Œ have all our, y ou know, little Œ those places, in one place. Q: That™s right. So that, if you had different plots of land in different areas, it™s all united, and you have this one larger plot Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ from the several. So, this was something significant for interwar years for Lithuania , which is an agricultural country. A: Economically, agriculturally, y-yye -yes it was a but since man does not live by bread alone Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ it was an act. We, at least the culture, the songs, the Œ also that there be together many human values disappeared. Q: It was lost. A: That one Œ we became wolves. Q: Really? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 18 A: You know, each one, you know Œ you know, I am on my own, you Œ you know, I™m there, you know, I have my own. Before, it was all together, it was a community. Q: How Œ how large Œ A: Now, we are dreaming about getting back into communities. We™re met Œ we destroyed them. Q: That happens a lot. That happens a lot. How large a farm, then Œ A: Twenty acres. We had the top with 20 acres . Q: So, it would have been more in hectares, it would have been wa Œ about 30 hectares, or something? A: I Œ I never understood the difference in size of Œ when we say in English, one acre, and I don™t know. All I know that our farm was about one Œ at some point, because I Œ to improve my health, which I said, that™s another big story, I Œ I ppicked up running Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ one kilometer. So, we measured, with my brother Adolfas , from one end to the other end from the farm was almost exactly a kilometer. Q: Okay. A: And we ran Œ he was Œ that™s what run. Q: And how fast could you run it? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 19 A: I was actually improving, so that I even participated in competitions. One kilometer. One kilometer was my distance. Q: Okay. A: And I practiced it until I was like 60 - 65. Q: No kidding, really? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: That™s the basis of my Œ when people like oh, you Œ you Œ you Œ oh, 96 says, you have to Œ you know, you have to take care of your Œ your Œ it does not come Œ Q: Naturally. A: Œ not Œ especially when there™s so many temptations. Q: Well, one of the reasons I ask the size of the farm is because that also was significant in dividing people into classes in the interwar years, and especially when there were various occupations. So five acres is a small farm. Fifty is already Œ A: For Œ like our neighbor had 40. And Œ and how that was decided was, you know, you Œ it™s the wetlands, some marshes, or the Œ the woods. And that Œ the neighbor who had 40 acres, some of it was very sandy, and a lot of woods, and a lot of work was needed to put into it, to make into Œ you know, usable land. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 20 Q: Was your father Œ were you able Œ was the family able to feed itself from the 20 acres? A: Yes, we had Œ well, we had enough, we had land which th ere Œ there had Œ there was variety, and Œ and earth richness, and we had Œ we grew everything that we needed to Œ for our life. Only we needed to buy salt. Just some items like that. Q: Did Œ was there a surplus to take to market? A: Yes, that™s how we farmers survived. Q: Okay. A: They grew extra rye, or potatoes, vegetables, which, you know, every Monday there was a market day in , and every Monday, early, from early, you Œ if you read my poetry, you will find out. Every Monday there were carriages full Œ the roads were full of farmers on their way to the market. Q: And in your family, who would go? A: My father, with the oldest brother Œ Q: With Povilas . A: Œ brother, yeah Q: Okay A: Oh, and sometimes just with my mother. Q: Okay. A: When she needed something to buy. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 21 Q: Did you ever join them? A: Which was all Œ sometimes. Which was also a meeting ground. Once a week, all the farmers from different villages ththat we friended for Œ for no other reason, they met there, and sometime they had some drinks. Was one of the Œ Q: All the people in your village, that you knew, the 98 or so, were they all Lithuanian? A: Yes, they were all Lithuanian. Q: So, it was a very homogenous group? A: Yes, yeah.

The basic, all the Œ all religious, and you know, the Bible, the New Testament, and Œ and commentaries, etcetera, etcetera. Q: Do you remember Œ A: And he read it every evening, loud, at some point when everything was done, just before going to bed, relaxed people, you know, in the winter, or what Œ when you just do some things that you do, still for the farm, in the evening at home, he used to read, and read from one of the books. Q: Out loud? A: Yes, loud. Q: Okay. A: Loud reading was very much part of my child Œ childhood. I had to read also, and when Œ sometimes neighbors used to get together and do some things together, and instead that just Œ you got tired sometimes, yapping.

If you did not Œ i f you were not interested in that aspect, you Œ you did not know. Q: Yeah, y ou didn™t know. Okay. One other thing that sounds interesting and not always emphasized, was learning. It sounds like it was something that was valued in your family. If your father read, and read every single day.

Q: Did he have Œ A: And his friends, they were, you know, writers and poets in the gymnasium that we came. Q: Well, he was born of that generation.

My brother, in in gymnasia Œ Q: Povilas A: Œ the high school got Œ a-a-and some of his friends, like Azisia(ph) (ph), later they got connected, they got a-a-a-already with some people who were discussing prep Œ this was immediately, I think after the revolution. Q: Russian revolution. A: It Œ yes. Q: 1917. A: And they ga Œ were discussing soci Œ thi Œ they were Œ I remember ve -very clearly, lying there, and there was no Œ I did not know, you know, what communist mean, they were the wi Œ there was no social Œ social democrats. They were talking about social democrats, which was opposed to Smetona . Q: So you™re Œ so what you™re describing to me, if I understand it Œ A: And they were what Œ what Œ why I remember this Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 56 Q: Okay. A: Œ that this is the first time I heard singing Q: ﬁThe Internationale .ﬂ A: And the Œ and they were singing. They were singing in Lithuanian, and they were Œ they Œ they Œ they were singing Internationale . Q: In Russian? A: No, interna Œ interna Œ Q: International. ﬁ The Internationale .ﬂ So, it was Œ A: So that that means, what it means, that there were people opposed to Œ to Œ to Œ Q: Smetona . A: Yeah. Q: And the Œ in Œ so this was, if I understand it Œ A: And that™s where I Œ I also discovered my Œ my Œ that Œ you see, my Œ Povilas was also trying to write poetry, at some pe Œ point. That he was publishing some of them in the mag Œ what™s the magazine o-of sort of socialist Œ again, I can™t remember now the Œ the name of the magazine, that Œ so that he was involved in Œ with Œ we can talk about this later, because I have other things to tell Œ tell about Povilas involvement, because he Œ Q: Okay. So, he had already more leftist ideas? A: Œ wer Œ yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 57 Q: Okay. A: For some times, he was very, very close to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to Wachay(ph). At some point Œ at some point, when Paleckis did not want to accept the post, he conferred, I know, with my brother. Q: So, your fa Œ your brother was a Œ a CP member. A: He was Œ you see, it™s here we Œ where I do not know the details, because many things during that period, were very, very, very secretive. Because, I remember in , people used to point near , the castle in . There was some little valley space. Said, that™s where Smetona shot the six Œ Q: Communists? A: Œ communists. More or less, they identified Œ Q: Is this the place where and Selenderf (ph) were shot? A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Is Œ okay. A: Yeah. So that he was involved, but that there was a movement, part of the Lithuanian Œ or came between maybe generation that maybe was around 30 or so, 25 or Œ between 20 or 30, had still s Œ a-and that comes from, I think, 1905. Did not come directly from Œ from the newly great Soviet Union . Q: I™m Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 58 A: It was still coming from there, that movement of the Œ that clashed with officials, Smetona , you know Q: Okay, I want to Œ I want to ex Œ A: No, this Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ what I™m telling now, is what Œ sort of my Œ my deductions Q: I understand. I understand, but Œ but I™d like to articulate them back, so to se Œ make sure that I understood it correctly. A: Yeah. Q: So, we™re talking about Œ when I ask you about Smetona Œ A: I need some cold Œ Q: Okay, let™s cut. A: Œ water, and I Œ Q: Okay, th Œ we™re running. A: Sure, when I™m talking about, you know now, around the questions here, and I™m sort of trying to get to it. You see , intuitively, and as a poet, and who sort of was there, and some of it I remember like un-directly, and un-directly, I know that I™m right, but I cannot feel Œ put my Œ you know, fingers on Œ on Œ on Œ on Œ on facts, on specifics, that I™m no Œ I know that I™m right un-direct, about the feelings of the people there. I know Œ remember very clearly, you know, sort of, you know, what I Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 59 heard Œ some glimpses out there, and I don™t need everyt hing literally, from A to Z to make my Œ my Œ my observations, yes. Q: I understand that. I understand that. It is Œ excuse us Œ okay. There are Œ I™m going to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be in two parts. One, in trying to say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of interviews like this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When Œ when we Œ when we conduct them, the strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say, you know you™re right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories. A: The danger is always to have Œ make it too narrow, too restricted. Permit a lit Œ me to open that™s there, and Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ which sometimes, on direct memories observations, are more truthful than Œ than factual sometimes, factual. Q: Well, that Œ people say that about art. A: Yes. Q: That Œ but in the Œ in the purpose of what we™re doing here, is we™re trying to establish an historical record, through the memories of people, decades after the events happened. And Œ and that™s why, in some ways, it is a counter kind of purpose. And, I would say, you know Œ A: Why? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 60 Q: Œ forgive me for that. Because as much as possible, I need to anchor things in context, in dates, in understanding. So I think Œ a-and I think it Œ A: But that™s what you are getting. Q: I know. But here™s the thing. What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But that is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at this interview, may not. So that™s why I want to repeat it back, and see if I have understood it properly, so that someone else can understand it properly. A: Yeah, do it. Q: Okay. So, here™s what I™m under Œ here™s the impression I™m getting, is that at some point in 1936, or 1937, because that™s the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it is a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the Œ separate from the living room, and lying and hearing Œ lying down in your bed, and hearing others in your family, behind the curtains, talking about politics. A: Not o-others, only one: Povilas and his invited friends. Q: Ah, okay, not your father Œ A: No, no, no Œ Q: Œ no Œ not anybody else. A: Œ no, no. Q: And so these are young men. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 61 A: No, they Œ t hey had their own they slept in the complete different area. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: So you Œ for example, at that time, you™re about 14 years old. Your brother is already a young man, he™s around 23 - 24 years old. And he invites his friends over, and they™re talking about the Spanish Civil War, and they™re talking about social democracy of a certain kind, and in the end, they sing ﬁ The Internationale ,ﬂ in Lithuanian. And then you remember, but you didn™t know this at the time, but you remember at some point in later years, hearing that when Justas Paleckis , who is someone most American or English speaking people would not know about, but Justas Paleckis was a leftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country, became the president, quote, unquote. I don™t remember his exact title, but was the first party secretary, Paleckis was the president, and under his signature, a lot of people get sent to , both then, and later. And what you are saying is that you intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because Paleckis Œ A: Now I remember why. Q: Okay. A: They Œ the name of the monthly was called Joniemas (ph). Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 62 Q: Joniemas (ph). A: Joniemas (ph). And they both wrote from it Œ for it. And maybe Paleckis was connected with the editorial staff, or something. But that™s th Œ how they Œ they sort of Œ Q: What their connection was. A: Œ the connection was, that she wrote Œ she published some poems, a-and his daughter sent to me some of those poems, they were sort of po Œ okay, I mean, they would call it at little Œ the leftist kind of Œ no, wa Œ politically Œ they™re obviously political poems. Q: Okay, and about when would Œ would have this been before the war? Befor Œ A: Thi-This Œ this was before. Q: Okay, so during independence times. A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. And so, your brother is trusted enough by Paleckis wa Œ A: To ask for his opinion. Q: Œ to Œ for his opinion to be asked, should Paleckis take that post, which was quite Œ A: I don™t know what that discussion was, but I understood that I do not remember my brother™s voice. But I think was to the Œ in some way, he was consulting him, should I take it, or not, trying to make up his mind. And I have no idea what my Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 63 brother told him. All I know that he Œ I understood from all of us Œ late Œ he told me this later, later, later. Q: What does later mean? A: Already in Œ in ™71, when I Œ Q: Okay, when you went back. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Okay. So this is 30 years Œ 33 years later, something li Œ well, sa Œ 30 years later. A: My Œ my brother is a Œ fell out of that Œ went to the Œ very soon, after the Soviets came in, my Œ Povilas come Œ went Œ come Œ abandoned that direction, completely. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. But he had it. In other words, if there was a direction of political thinking in your family, through po Œ and Povilas sounds like the most political Œ A: The other two brothers, they were not political at all. Q: Okay. A: They were totally farmers, kind of immersed in Œ in the world of their own, local. Q: And your father as well? A: Yes, very much. Q: Okay. But Povilas was an influence on you. A: Yes, yes, he was, in this Œ his books, his books, yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 64 Q: Okay. A: No, I Œ I sort of looked up a little bit, you know, yes. Q: So Œ A: Not in that Œ that Œ his political world was totally Œ like he subscribed Œ subscribed to so Œ Socialdemokratas , a weekly newspaper, which was you know, so Œ so Œ social Lithuanian party. And I could Œ I Œ I Œ I hated it. Q: Did you really? A: It w-was so boring and so serious, and so the whole Œ I could not be Œ I just Œ Q: So i-it Œ it didn™t speak to you. A: He used to subscribe to it. No, no. Q: Okay. A: That was totally out of my interest. Q: Okay, okay. Thank you. That™s what ga Œ that™s what I wanted to get a sense of, of what was the Œ not only the facts of pre-war life, of you know, the circumstances of your family, but also the atmosphere. You know, what did people talk about? What was their world, what mattered to them? And in Œ in Œ in very specific ways Œ A: So, there are glimpses that there were talks, political talks Q: Okay. A: Œ betwe Œ in which, you know, about which I cannot tell more than what I just told. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 65 Q: Yeah. So Œ A: That™s one memory I think is pretty oh Œ revealing. Q: Yeah. So we come to 1939, and Œ A: And more Œ more than that, that Œ like between Papilys and Semeniıkiai , there was a village of . Q: . A: And pu Œ if you have to fix sometimes some shoes, or also the Œ some sewing to do, some Œ there was some Œ a family, I think, of two brothers, perha Œ thethey were very Œ they were special at crafts Q: So they were Œ A: So, I used, sometimes, to stop if my f Œ mother gave to fix something there, and they, whenever I was there, they were only talking politics. Q: Really? A: An-And like all Œ like oh, you see, sorry for this mess. The police was here last night, and they look for, you know, everything turned, you know, they look for Œ Q: Upside-down. A: Upside-down. Q: Okay. A: Because they were talk Œ they were really involved, so much that the police was ask Œ look for Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 66 Q: They had socialist orientations? A: They were, maybe there were some publications Œ Q: Okay. A: Or they were maybe involved Œ oh yes, now I remember that that week, on the branches of the trees by the road, by the cemeteries, and the cemeteries were by our house, there were some leaflets attached again, political leaflets. I have no idea what they promoted. And it was next day after that, that I had to stop at their house in Œ for something, and the police was Œ and I saw that, you know, everything was Œ was in a mess. The police was there. They probably suspected that they produced those leaflets and hung them there. Q: Were they known to have a particular political view? A: N-N Œ people maybe knew. I had no idea. Q: So, it could have been they were very leftist. A: I Œ I will not have any ideas that there were any other views than those that came from Œ from Œ from Kaunas , from the capital. Q: Okay. A: I-I was not in that age, and I was still in my shell. Q: Yeah. A: But those were glimpses into the real world, which I remember very well, that there were people who were doing something, I don™t know wh-why, and what Œ for Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 67 what reasons, and what is said, what was in those leaflets. Because police came, people said, oh don™t touch them. Let the police do Œ come, and took, so I had no Œ had no idea what was in those leaflets. Q: So, you don™t know if they were right wing or left wing? A: Ki Œ kill Œ kill Œ kill Smetona , or Œ Q: Oh, I see. A: Œ or emb Œ or embrace Stalin , I d on™t know. Q: Okay. A: I have no idea. Q: When 1938 Œ well, actually, 1939 come around Œ A: I want to interrupt one more. Q: Sure. A: Same as later, when the Germans, same as Soviets, they did not come blindly, with no preparations. They had already people watching for years, probably, and some of them were connected, preparing, you know, here and there and there. Like Germans had same. Some of them Œ some of those people maybe were, you know Œ I don™t kn-know. But none of those occupiers came with, like th ey do now, sometimes they just go to another country, with Œ I think they had planted people. I™m thinking that now. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 68 Q: Yeah. Yeah. So, let™s come to 1939. Do you remember whether there was any reaction in Semeniıkiai , or , or Papilys , about the German attack on Poland , September first? A: There were two reactions. The dominant reaction was ah, we have Vilnius now back. Q: Because of the controversy with Poland on Vilnius . A: Yes, yes. Vilnius was the center Œ there was produced happiness. The Œ the Poles were the most hated nation in the world, for Lithuanians. Q: Why? A: Why? The Œ Q: For Œ we have five Œ A: They took Vilnius . They took our capital away. Q: So that™s a little ditty in Lithuanian, about Poles. A: No. Yes. Q: Okay. A: No, no, they were Œ they™re more Pilsudskis , and all those Œ those guys, they Œ they were all most hated people. Q: Okay. A: So th Œ there was elation when the Œ the Russians decided to Œ to Œ to eventually put Œ attach Œ to reattach Vilnius to Lithuania . So for Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 69 some time, that, almost like sort of Œ that elation, almost to cancel all the bad things for e Œ for Œ at least for a moment, until they began to think, you know, and see, oh, they™re bad, bad . They are the [inde Q: So you said there was another. There was Œ there were two reactions. One was nice Œ A: Oh, the other reaction that says oh, now Œ now Œ now, we may have another war. We are having another war, and Œ and Œ and Œ Q: So people started talking a bout that? A: Yes, yes, they did Œ I Œ I don™t remember but I Œ I Œ I cannot con Œ yes, every family already knew that this is bad. Q: Okay. A: That this is bad. Q: Okay. Now, was the Œ when you mention that Œ that Russia attached Vilnius back to Lithuania , why would Russia do Œ A: I don™t know really, again my mem Œ see, I am very bad at dates Œ at which point that became real, because first the Œ okay, Germany , and the Œ the y met Œ they made a deal with Russians, and they wanted, sort of, Poland . Q: That™s right. A: But at which point Œ and then Russians march into Lithuania only in 1940. Q: Thirty-nine. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 70 A: Thirty-nine? Q: Thirty-nine. A: Oh, so immediately, so that decision was Œ Q: What Œ what the Œ what the Œ the factual reference Œ A: All I remember boy Œ being in Papilys in sixth grade, in the bench, sitting there in the middle of the class, and the teacher Œ somebody comes in and take the teacher out, and then the teacher returns, and asks everybody to listen carefully, and tells that the war started, and that Œ and the Soviets Œ that the message was given to the teacher, and that was the situation. So Œ and so that Œ that™s how we found out what happened. Q: Okay. The background to this, from what I Œ from what I have read, is that that Molotov was signed in August, 1939 Œ August 23 rd, and one week later, September first, is when Hitler attacks Poland . And sometime in the fall, I believe it was October, I could be wrong, the Soviets start marching in, and that i Œ then Œ start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like, yeah. Q: Okay. So, during that Œ those several months, did you continue going to school, did you Œ A: That was very intense, that was my first, you know, no Œ yes Œ my first year into Œ that was fifth grade, yeah. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 71 Q: You were then Œ if it was Œ if you were born December 24 th, 1922, you would have been 17 years old in December 1939. And were you then Œ by then in gymnasium in Bir, or still Œ A: No, no, no, I was in this Œ sixth gr Œ sixth Œ fifth Œ sixth grade in Papilys . I was in Papilys . Q: Okay, you were still in sixth grade Œ A: I Œ I went Œ began going to school very late, because I was needed on the farm . And then, after the fourth grade, I skip one year again, before going to the fifth grade. So there were many Œ I was not Œ the family was not even sure if I will, you know, ever go to high school or gymnasium. Q: Okay, okay, okay. That Œ that Œ that makes sense. A: Because first I was still very Œ I was not in the best of Œ my weakness body remained for a good Œ until I was fif Œ di Œ 16. Q: Okay. A: That™s all. And I did not talk to anybody, I was always . I did not communicate with anybody. And su d Œ and Œ and I Œ no, and it happen, as things happen, that suddenly I Œ I Œ I Œ for some reason, I wanted to tal Œ I was ready to talk. So, neighbors said, he talks, oh, he talks. It became a Œ a joke. I was known as the silent Œ you know. Q: So you weren™t a very sociable person for a long time. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 72 A: No, I was Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ I was in a shell. Q: And then Œ A: And I remained in the Œ in the shell, I mean, to Œ today, I™m in a shell. Q: What are your first memories of life changing, when the Soviets appeared in Lithuania ? What are your first memories of that? A: Fear was Œ you began to feel Œ I mean, feel fear. You could feel it floating over, like everybody Œ like how it manifested, that fear, I cannot describe now. But you could feel it, and see it in the Œ in the Œ almost in the physical movements, in the faces, and how Œ in the relationship. And silences here, and Œ creep in, and Œ and then you Œ we immediately began hearing about neighbors being arrested there. It wa Œ it started before the mass deportations, even those small deportations and arrests Œ Q: Of people you knew? A: Yeah Œ hm? Q: Of people you knew? A: not in our village, but in the neighboring villages, you cou Œ you know, families, and all individuals, you immediately heard. You know, that Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 73 that became be Œ happening Œ began happening immediately after the Soviets marched in. Q: Was the Œ and so, what about Œ A: We talk about, you know, the big deportations. Q: Yeah. A: But small arrests and deportations began immediately. Q: Did your schoolteachers change? A: Yes, the atmosphere felt like Œ like Œ like the de Œ joyful hap Œ sort of blissful, careless atmosphere like some cloud began descending. Q: Did that mean that the teacher who might have formerly been a friendly teacher, now became more closed, or did it mean it was a new teacher? A: No, they were the same, but you could almost feel, you know, a certain kind of seriousness, a different kind of Œ it changed da Œ through the village, it™s Œ I mean, ii-it™s difficult to describe how a system, repressive system like that, and especially when you begin to see the actual, real results can begin to affect the whole Œ th-the Œ and like produces kind of invisible atmosphere there, that is there. You cannot describe it, but you Œ you Œ you feel it™s there. Q: Let™s cut for a second. Okay. A: And then, some of the neighbors that had a larger houses were Œ immediately there Œ some rooms were divided by the Œ by the order from the Œ from , from Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 74 Œ and some people from other places, cities, stranger, total strangers, we did Œ did not know where they came from Œ Q: Were they Lithuanian? A: Œ they became Œ Li-Lithuanian. Q: Okay. A: Planted there as Œ as sort of Œ I Œ had to be, you know, you had to accept. Q: So, was there anybody that you knew who was locally known to have been a sympathizer of the Soviets, when they came? A: Not in the lib Œ not in the villages that I Œ not in our villages. Q: So strangers, it was really strangers who came, or Œ who came and were planted in the villages, but not local people who suddenly Œ A: No, no. No, no. Q: Œ unmask, and say alright, I™m a Œ A: No, no Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ no, we did not know, and at least I have doubted there were, you know, ca cases and places. But Œ where that happened, but in the few vill ages around Semeniıkiai , I have not heard cases like that. Q: Did you, during this time, start going to school in Bir ? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 75 A: No. See, there is Œ there was sixth Œ sixth Œ now Œ now, we™re trying to place. Right, but I was in the fifth, not sixth grade. Then, one year I skipped. I have notes somewhere, I tried to recreate. Since I was too old Œ you had to be certain age t o go into the third class of the high school Œ there were six years. So, since I was too old, I had Œ I was at the age when I was Œ I Œ I could have been accepted only in the seventh grade. Q: Okay. A: So Œ but I wanted to go to high school, and it was act ually my uncle, my mother™s brother, who kept telling my mother and my father that he shoul Œ you should really sum Œ he has to go, this kid has to go to Œ so, because he sort of, I guess, believed in me. Q: Did they have to pay? Did it cost to send you to high school? A: No, no. Q: No. A: It was free. So, that year, I decided to learn to go to Œ to Œ to am Œ he helped my uncle, rented a place, a room for me. Q: From the lady with the bagel shop? A: Yes. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 76 A: And I s Œ managed to skip through Œ I had to go through all those years, four years, or five year of languages, Latin and French, and Œ and all Œ oh boy. That was very, very intense. And then there was an exam, and I passed. And when I passed, they said, you did better t han most of ma Œ our students did. Q: So, this was to get into high school? A: To get into the seventh class. Q: To the seventh class, okay. A: So I skipped four years of high school, in one winter. Q: You mean, skipped four years of high school in one winter? A: Yes. I jumped from the Œ from the Œ okay, second grade to seventh. Q: Oh wow, that™s a jump. A: That™s a jump. Q: That™s a jump. A: And to Œ it was the sensation of the Œ of for some time. Q: I can see why. I can see why. But you had to do home studying Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ in order for that Œ to do that. A: I had the Œ I had the Œ my runk Œ uncle Œ uncle paid for the tutors, and Œ and all that. Q: Okay. And he was still pastor in Papilys , at the Reform church Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 77 A: No, no, in . Q: Oh, so he had become a pastor in now. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes. He was never in Papilys . Q: I thought that™s where your parents went to church, and that he was the pastor there. A: Yeah, but the pas Œ you go Œ you don™t have to go to your pastor™s church. Q: Got it. A: You can go to Œ Q: Any Œ any. A: Œ any Protestant church. Q: Okay. A: Or any Catholic church. Q: Okay, got it. I Œ I misunderstood. A: No, no. Q: Yeah. So, this is when you actually moved to the city, the local city, ? A: Yes, for tha Œ yeah, for the winter. Q: And Œ A: And then Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 78 Q: Now, the bagel shop Œ excuse me now. A: Ye-Yeah. Q: The bagel shop, was that in a Jewish neighborhood? Was there a Jewish neighborhood? A: I do not Œ I Œ there must be clattered in the different areas of . I Œ I only remember that there was Œ you know, I know there was a Œ not mok Œ what do you call that, mosque Œ Q: The synagogue. A: Synagogue. I don™t remember any specific Jewish area, but there must have been. Q: Okay. A: Because even in , when I moved, I was as Œ as you can see, I did not have time to walk around, and know the city. To skip si Œ you know, six classes, imagine Œ five Œ Q: Yeah. A: And even later, I was not that Œ I was Œ I still remain ed a book person. I did not Œ I Œ I did not famil Œ now I regret it, I did not vo Œ familiarize more with the city. But Œ Q: But you Œ in other words, you didn™t really know whether or not it was neighborhood that was predominantly Jewish, or not. It was just a neighborhood. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 79 A: No, you could see them there and there and there, different stores, scattered through the whole city. I did not Œ tell you the truth, I did not know the Œ did not Œ was not aware. Q: Okay. A: Even th Œ maybe there was, but I was not aware. I under-ders tood that they were every Œ you know, scattered. Q: Okay. A: Through the all, sort of Œ there was some bur Œ suburban par-parts, where there were no Jews, but in the center, they were ev Œ you know, there and there and there and there. Q: Yeah. A: And I did not even Œ could not even tell how many, you know? I figure that there must be, in a city of 5,000, which I was told by the mayor of later, in Brooklyn Œ he had the in Brooklyn . Q: Oh, he also went Œ he Œ he was also an Œ a refugee, in Brooklyn ? A: Yes. (ph). Q: (ph), okay. A: Ye-Yeah, that Œ there were five Œ at that point was five. He would have known the Œ how many Jews there may have been. I figured that there may be two Œ 300. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 80 A: But then later Œ now I Œ I keep the information that I have seen was that there were 2,000 Jews still in ? Says, how could that be? Because that means that 5,000 people lived in , and there were 2,000 plus killed, that means almost like a half. So th-there is something wrong, but I think that that figure comes that when the Jews were killed in , they brought them from all other places, like including Papilys . Q: Okay. A: Probably that™s what Œ that™s how the 2,000 come. Th Œ it does not come from the city itself. Q: Okay. A: It comes Œ I think they collected from all other areas, and then th-thi-this Œ this is Œ this is the place where we™ll dump Q: We™ll come to that. A: Yeah. Q: But right now, we™re Œ chronologically, we™re in that first Soviet year of occupation, where you Œ during this time is when you skip four classes, through your uncle™ s sort of both suggestion and Œ and strong advice Œ A: So my first gymnasium class, the seventh, was already Œ was under the Soviets. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 81 Q: Do you remember anything in particular from that year, in that cla Œ in this Œ in this grade? A: Oh yes, I k Œ I remember. Q: What Œ what can you tell us about it? A: I mean, there Œ one Œ one thing is Œ is that we immediately in this, besides la Œ that Œ no, no, no, no, the first Œ first year was still Œ there were no Russians the first year. Q: Okay, okay. A: That™s why I had one year of French Œ not fr Œ that Œ actually, before that, I had two years of French, and Latin, because the next, in the grade, under the Soviets, first then went out, Latin out. Q: Okay. A: French out, Russian in. French no good, Latin no good, Russian good. So I had at least one year Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ of Œ Q: Russian. A: Œ Russian. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 82 Q: Well, that would make sense, because the government, in July 1940, is when there is that vote to join the Soviet Union . And that would have been after your seventh class Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ but before your eighth. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: And then, one new category was introduced, the political education. Q: Okay. A: The political teacher, political Œ Q: And who was the political teacher? A: Don™t remember his name. But very boring, talking like somebody who tells that this is what happened, this is what communist party is, and what™s a Œ it™s very good for the people. Talking always a very monotonous voice, and very like somebody who did not believe in it himself. Somebody who was like assigned material, he did not sound that he believed in what he was Œ Q: Sounds like a parrot, almost. A: Œ what he was saying. But you had to learn, you know, first thing you had to learn by heart, the history of the communist party. A-And then, there was another one. He was, you know, radical Œ class to teach. That was the subject we had to learn. But Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 83 then there was another, assigned Œ a ka Œ general political supervisor of the gymnasium, of the high school. And don™t remember her name. She was a woman of some 40 Œ 40 Œ some 40 years, and she was always there, and we knew who she is, and why she is there. And when she was approaching passing, everybody became silent until she passes, and Œ but I Œ to me it™s wa Œ very, very Œ became very, very, v ery important, this woman. She was also hated, hated by everybod y, not Œ not for another re as Œ that Œ because she was Jewish. And because the mayor, as Soviets marched in, the mayor Œ they appointed as the mayor, a Jew educated in Moscow, (ph) Q: Kelmer (ph)? A: (ph). Q: Okay, k-e-l-Œ A: Œ at me straight, and says, never do this again. Q: Wow. A: And put that Œ puts where it was, just Q: Wow. That could have ended a lot differently. Wow. A: And thi Œ and that™s, you know, one of the moments you never forget. Q: Yeah. A: Because it could have ended badly, not only for me, but for Œ also for my family, and Œ and we don™t know how far that would have gone. But then, all these years, I Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 84 have been also thinking, why did she do that? I mean, one thing that, you know, was Œ I was still very fragile, and very naïve, and very Œ sort of like, she may have really meant okay, he made Œ he™s a stupid, little guy, and he made a mistake. If I tell him maybe Œ you know, she like, had a picture of me. But then I thought, maybe she played double game. Maybe she worked also for the underground. She may have worked Œ okay, here I am, I™m hated, you know Œ Q: Right. A: Œ by everybody. I will Œ knew that, but I will Œ will be Œ I will also help the underground. She may have been a double like, agent. Q: Was she Œ do you know if she was from herself? A: No, no, she Œ she was not from . Q: Okay, okay. A: But when the Œ and now, now, when you ask this question, I Œ I Œ I cannot guarantee, really. We assume that she came from Moscow with the Œ you know, but she may have had some relatives in Œ so, I will never know. I will never have an answer, because later in that she retreated together with the Œ when the Soviets retreated, and she was shot with other Jews. But she saved my life. Q: Yes, she did. Yes, she did. And it™s interesting how they Œ I mean, did that mean that they look through all the caps of the students, to see if there are papers in them? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 85 A: No, they knew. They were educat ed, they went Œ went to KGB training, you know, where to look next, if somebody hides something. They knew where to look for Œ where people usually Œ they had track of record where people usually hide. Q: Did you speak of this to anyone at the time? A: I could not. I could not. Because I could not let the other students Œ they were asking, so what did she tell you? I made a joke, or something, but I could not tell, because then other students would know that they are connected with underground. I could not talk. Q: And they wo Œ A: And later Œ I don™t know where that was already, on the Germans. Q: Okay. A: That™s another story. Q: So, did you ever Œ A: But this, I Œ I Œ I Œ there, I could not talk about it at all, to nobody, absolutely nobody. Q: Not even the student who had given you the leaflets. A: No, I could not. Q: Okay. Okay. Now, you mentioned earlier, someone who had been the mayor of , Mr. (ph), is that his name? A: Kle-Kle (ph). Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 86 Q: (ph), (ph). And then a new mayor comes Œ A: Thanks to him, I bought my first Bolex camera. Q: Oh, no kidding. A: He lent Œ he was the guaran Œ guarantor, for when I had to buy, and had no money. I went to Peerless (ph), and he was the guarantor, so that I could pay in installments. Q: That™s quite a significant step. Now, was he Œ he was the mayor, and then comes the Soviet system, and then comes Mr. (ph), or Draugas (ph) (ph), Comrade from Moscow. Did Œ does that mean that Mr. (ph) was thrown out, or did he stay? A: Must be, because Œ must be. Q: Okay. A: I Œ I don™t know, I nev Œ Q: He never told you anything about the Œ A: Because I was never interest ed . Q: Got it. Got it. It™s okay, that™s okay. A: My interests, I Œ people don™t understand that Œ how could one be, and done what with no interest in what™s around me. In the social life, I don™t know if you are aware Œ you must be aware that somebody did a very, sort of dirty paper on me in Œ in the New York book. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 87 Q: Review of bilk Œ books? A: Yes. Q: Yeah. A: And ha Œ it™s all Œ you know, it™s all absurd, all these . But I could not Œ he could believe Œ he could not understand that one can be so totally submerged in what one is interested in, and lack for Œ he was ask, would you tell me, you must have been very involved in Œ in Œ in Œ in the local, you know, with the I don™t know the society. I know no Œ I knew nobody there, and was not interested, you know. He say, oh, but you wrote in your book, ﬁ I Had Nowhere to Go ,ﬂ that you were very, very involved in Œ in Œ well, I was. And people who were ri Œ who were in literature, they knew. But that was my work. The rest did not exist. That™s all. So that Œ that™s Œ life was going there, you know, everything Œ Q: Did you ever Œ A: So I don™t know, I never asked Œ same as never asked my own father, you know, who was your father? So, (ph) to ask Œ as(ph) never came to my head. The more that I met him here in Brooklyn , and we had already different problem here. So Œ but of course, automatically, I think the nec Œ I™m Œ what I™m amazed that he was not deported. Oh, I Œ I think he ran Œ he maybe had left before the se Œ Soviets came in. He knew, he was not that stupid. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 88 Q: Okay. A: So he ended up in Œ in German Œ in German displaced person camps, like that. That™s where I met him. Q: Okay, the Œ A: How Œ yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: Did you con Œ now, after that, did you continue distributing those leaflets, or had you Œ A: Yes, and I even intensified, but that was a lesson, that was a lesson that Œ how foolish I was. And I di Œ you know, I Œ I did not carry Œ I had to be much more careful. Q: Well, who would you get them from, and who would you give them to? A: This very Œ okay, first where I got them. There was one teacher, Kavalunas (ph). Q: Kavalunas (ph), okay. A: Kavalunas (ph). He later ended up in Chicago . And he started the Lithuanian department of that University of Illinois. Q: Okay. A: He was very, very important. But Œ and there was another one, there was a Vitakunis (ph). Q: Vitakunis (ph), okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 89 A: Vitakunis (ph). So, I know what happened to Kavalunas (ph), I don™t know what happened to Vitakunis (ph). But, Vitakunis (ph), when she was studying, his Œ hi-he Œ he studied history of liter-literature, and this thesis that she wrote, was on the Œ on cu Œ futurists, Dadaists, the whole period transition, beginning with the Œ with the Œ what was happening in Œ in Œ in Russia , pre Œ before even Mayakovsky here, with the young Mayakovsky , and all the Œ the Œ all the early constructivists, etcetera, were the early, modern arts. That was his dissertation, and he was deli Œ teaching literature in the Œ in the high school. So, one day, he said, don™t tell anybody, but I want you to Œ to read this now. He said, now it™s, you know, forbidden, even to know Œ read about the history of the Œ and I read this dissertation. And that was my introduction to many, many, many things. Q: Okay, so yes, of course Mayakovsky Œ A: An introduction to modern art in the Œ in the west Russia , in Paris, etcetera. And then a Œ we discu Œ tal Œ after I read it, and thanked him and returned it, we sort of became friends. And then it was he who gave me the first leaflets. And then he in Œ he wrote Œ he did not introduce me personally, but Kavalunas (ph) appro Œ yo Œ he Œ they knew tha Œ you know, Kavalunas (ph) and Vitakunis (ph) were like that. Q: They were friends. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 90 A: Yes. So, he told me that, you can trust this guy. So Kavalunas (ph) was the one Œ Vitakunis (ph) had not Œ he was not so connected with the underground. But Kavalunas (ph) was very involved. I don™t even know how deeply. He was very, very, very, very. So, the leaflets came to me from Kavalunas (ph). We used Œ and we used to meet Œ aand we Œ we ru Œ at the Œ at the castle, somewhere. Q: And, what was the content of such leaflets? What was written in them? A: Mostly transcripts from BBC, and some other short wave radios, mostly news, news, news Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ concerning the Œ what Soviets were doing, and what Germans were doing in their areas. Q: So this is during the Soviet times? A: They were Œ they were news. Q: Okay. A: It be Œ yes. Q: This was Œ A: It began and continued under the Œ Q: Under the Germans. A: Œ under Germans, it continued, but I got deep Œ deeper involved. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 91 A: That™s another story. Q: We™ll come to it. We™ll come to it. A: Here, I was only under the Soviet sa Œ was only distributing. We helping to pass Œ Q: And who would you distribute it to? A: Only very, very close friends, and they distribute it to their close, close friends. Q: And these friends, were they your age, most of the time? A: Some older. Q: Some were older. A: Some Œ some were older. Q: But still your generation. A: Not exactly. Some Œ Patra(ph) (ph), who later helped Miltinis to start the theater in . Q: Oh yeah, mm-hm. A: He was already quite well known poet, you know. He was one genera Œ generation before me. Q: Okay. A: So yeah, I worked within my generation, and the one above. Q: So now that, you know, you got this very pointed warning from the politruka Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 92 Q: Œ did you put those newspapers in another part of your clothing, or did you continue with your hat? A: No, I did not get it Œ no, since then I did not carry, because they Œ they won™t Œ I did not know, maybe she informed somebody else about me, and I may Œ maybe Œ may have been followed. I had to be very, very, very careful after that. Q: So you didn™t Œ you didn™t continue, and Œ A: I continued, but I had to be much more careful how I made my Œ how I meet the Œ to whom I Œ I want to pass, and had to be worked out. Q: During this time, was there any violence Œ A: Also, that Œ that Œ that happened actually very close also, to the Germans marching in, yeah. Q: So that would have been spring 1941, because they march in June, in 1941. A: Yes, yeah. Q: Okay. A: And that™s wa Œ maybe why I don™t remember her name, because I met her very, very soon after that, yeah. Q: Okay. Now, during the Soviet time, was there any open Œ you talk about this atmosphere of fear, that™s even hard to describe, but it kind of descends. Was there violence? Did you see people beaten up in the street? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 93 A: I was Œ there may have been, but I™m not aware of th Œ I was not involved in it, and Œ and the use of any violence against Soviets in Lithuania would have been very, very, very mu ch kept suppressed by Œ by Œ by this Œ would be difficult for facts like that to come out. Q: I even mean violence by Soviets. Was there any Œ A: The violence as psychological, and Œ or Œ or Œ or direct, you know. If you are arrested in Œ you Œ you kno w Œ you know what happens with so Œ the Œ the Œ how the Soviet police handled those whom they arrested, or Œ or deported. So that™s Œ if that is not violence, then what is violence, yes. Q: I™m talking before the deportations, the actual deportations, in that intra-months, and so on, when you talk about that, was there Œ A: It was an Œ it was devious ly Œ the control was like a Œ a Œ a Œ okay, it began immediately, because they came with a plan. And immediate wa Œ slow was the critique, of course, in the press and presentation of the existing, previous system, preparation for the Œ for electivization ; it was to take place immediately. So that there were Œ they were restructuring every part of the society, of the Œ if the Œ under the Germans, who had, you know, they came in, in action, they were chasing somebody. They had no time to stop and Œ and control everything. Here they came in, and they settled down. In two days they cannot began Œ they began exerting their control. If under the Germans Œ you give them first page of the provincial paper, for Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 94 their bulletins; it had to be, or Œ or . Then you can do whatever you want. Under the Soviets, not a single sentence, not a single word we passed at Œ you cou Œ you could pass without being Œ without approved. Because they were there. They were, you know, they had nothing else to do, but to control and Œ and transform it into their own system. And their Œ you know, they came prepared. Q: So, is that sort of total control, you™re talking. A: And Œ and Œ and Œ no, we are talking about total control. Total. Absolutely total. And they always a Œ a Œ managed to call up if Œ I mean, many came already prepared from Moscow , the key persons. But many satellites, local, either Œ at the beginning, maybe even had some dreams and fantasies that this may be good, we can, you know, the Œ when Œ because all the propaganda was, you know, that this is it, this is great, this is way Œ you know, that was real bad, and now we™ll be paradise. And some felt Œ some sort of believed that, maybe not hundred percent, but th-th Œ they thought that they can also have some impa Œ impact themselves, and they say that, what I will do a lit Œ with we will shift it that way, we™ll be okay, maybe, maybe. So what happened later, like a Œ maybe when the deportations began, is something else. Q: Yeah. A: The be Œ e-even those who real believed that Œ that maybe had fantasies about that this could be maybe somehow turns the right direction, I think there were very, very few who believed 10 months later. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 95 Q: So, what was going on with your brother Povilas at this time? The Soviets have come in Œ A: He Œ but like two or three months later Œ he told me this later. Q: Yeah. A: When he was already Œ he was already out. Q: Okay, what was Œ was he still studying? A: But he was struggle still, you know, leftist, and he sort of Œ he had some ideas. Whi ch is nothing wrong. But Œ but he was out of the Œ of the Œ if he had even any dreams that maybe this was clear with Œ immediately, it was clear to anybody. Q: At this point, Povilas would have been about, oh, 28 years old, something like that. A: He Œ he was working as a veterinarian already. Q: Okay. In Bi ? A: No, no, he was in Kedainiai Œ Kedainiai , and later in the Vilnius area. Q: Area. Okay. A: He was Œ became also very closed just in his profession. He did not write any more, did not publish. Q: Hm. Well, you know, it was, for someone who has leftist leanings, this kind of experience was quite traumatic, because it is belying the idealism that a person could Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 96 have had, you know. And you have this inner immigration, what the East Germans call innere immigration , you know? A: Yeah, you know, that™s Œ that™s what Œ they said that. Unfor tunately, the whole Œ this communists started in their ow Œ in their own country, and their own time. Q: I want to touch on something else that you mentioned earlier. And you said Œ and that™s on the Œ the anti-Semitic aspect. You say that both the politruka Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ and the mayor, were hated Œ A: I think that Œ that fact that both were Jews, to the farming community, who had just 20 years earlier, managed to liberate from tsars, and had this very Œ like a sense of being independent, unfor Œ a-a-and still very, very fragile. To Œ to Œ to see that we are again of controlled by somebody else, if not tsars, then Jews, somebody. I think that these un Œ it was not Œ I could feel that. It was not talked much about, but jo Œ j jokes were made about . I don™t remember those jokes, but Œ but then the Russians Œ now we had again Russians, and the Jews, and the Œ a-aand the Œ and I think that that aspect Œ this has not been Œ maybe it has been written about, sort of mentioned that this instituted just fresh liberation. And now again, somebody else is there, on the Œ on top of us. Had important effect, on the why some were Œ some Œ some of them ignored, or Œ or did not pay too much Œ and then, he Œ he Œ I Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 97 especial Œ the killing of Jews, coincided with the big deportation, you know, of Lithuania . But that minimized, I think, simp Œ sympathies for what was happening, at the same time, to the Jews. Q: Okay. A: It affect how much, you know, the Œ lik e Œ like same went out and discuss, you know, how Putin and Russia affected Trump ™s el -election Œ election, and one says this and this, the other . But definitely, yes. Q: And had you heard before, like in Œ before these events, before the Soviet takeover, had you heard people make jokes about Jews, or say anti-Semitic things? A: No, no, no, Jews were some Œ and what Œ even if I could read in those transcripts from BBC, and later in the Œ you know, was typing them, it™s still Œ it was so outrageous, that many did not believe that this really happened. Q: Okay, what Œ A: Saying that you don™t re Œ hu-human beings are not made up to react personally to Œ to abominable events. Like, okay, I Œ I have to confess that I did not react to the 9-11 event, until I saw Œ met some, really peop Œ people who just managed to escape. Or the Œ or the Œ the firemen from SoHo , right there where I live, then Œ then it became real. When I watched the buildings collapse, and I knew that thousands of people are there collapsing, I-I had no emotional res Œ it™s like, it was too big. It was too big. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 98 Q: Not that you Œ does it mean that when you had no emotional response, you didn™t care, or it was too big? A: No, no, that you Œ that you are not made physically to Œ it™s Œ it™s like too big. Abstract. Too big. Only when Œ it has to become more personal. Q: Well, you know Œ A: I will tell you later another story where the si Œ killing of the Jews. Q: Oh, you know, that reminds me of what Stalin said, which many people say was his strategy and his tactic, that the death of six million, or Œ he didn™t use the word six million, but the death of a million is a statistic, the death of one person is a tragedy. A: Yes. Q: You know, I™m paraphrasing here, but it™s Œ A: Well, that™s it™s too Œ it™s too big. We are not made up psychologically and that you need something personal, something that you could iden Œ identify. So Œ Q: So here is my question. When you Œ A: So when I was sta Œ people were Œ those Œ again, the nor Œ the population did not get that information, those newsp Œ newspapers. Mostly the intellectual kind of community saw them. So that the rumor that oh, it™s the ge Œ you know, Germans there are killing all the Jews? They™re taking out somebody in the Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 99 village shoots one German soldier, they wipe out the whole village. They believed, and they did not believe. It was like it™s Œ how could anybody do Œ be so horrible, you see? Q: So, you™re talking Œ if I can Œ I™m going to try to anchor this Œ A: Yes, yes. Q: Œ in as pa Œ particular time. You™re talking about BBC transmissions that you are involved in distributing, not yet transcribing, but still distributing Œ A: What the Soviets were doing in own country Œ Q: With the sa Œ yeah. A: Œ and the gulags, etcetera. Q: Okay. A: That was easier to Œ to Œ to wr Œ because that was already happening to Lithuanians. So that was at Œ easier to understand. Q: That was real. That was actually Œ A: That was real. Q: Œ real. Okay. A: What Germans were doing, it was not Œ not Œ not so real yet. Q: But was the BBC , at this time, while they™re still allies, the Soviets and the Germans, were they transmitting already, the crimes of the Germans against the Jews? That is, was that something that you were picking up? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 100 A: I Œ I think they were Œ when they did already, they were doing that in Poland , you see Œ Q: Yeah, that™s right. That could have ve Œ very well been. A: Yes. Q: That Œ that it was happening in Poland . A: Yes. Q: So you would have been getting news of these atrocities through the BBC. A: From BBC, y es. Q: While the Soviets are still in power. A: Yes. Q: Okay. And Œ and people were a-at Œ in their circumstances, non-Jewish people, the Lithuanians, and whoever else was not Jewish, was looking at the Jews who might have been put in power, and saying, look at, they have brought a new regime, we™re not independent any more. And at the same time, if they get news from some underground press, they don™t believe it too much. A: Yeah, but the Œ but as I said before the bys Œ the population of the Lithuania Œ Lithuania did not know that, did not get that news. They did not read BBC then, yeah. Q: Okay, okay. A: That was known by sa Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 101 Q: But you knew it, yes? When you Œ you knew it. A: I knew it, as hard as it was to believe. I Œ I Œ I Œ I saw Œ I Œ I knew it. Q: What was going on in Poland, you know at that time? A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes. Q: Okay. So this Œ this time when the teacher Œ the politruka Œ the Œ the political officer, gives you this warning, is coming close to when the Soviet Nazi Œ A: During the last months of Œ Q: The last months. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: Somewhere there. I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ there, I cannot place the memory Œ Q: That™s okay. A: Yeah. Q: That™s okay. Now we come to June 1941. Do you remember the actual deportations? Did you see any of it? A: At Œ during one period Œ and, but I do not know a Œ if it was during that period, and I don™t know what month, but I remember that, with some other Œ some other friends, students, the railroad station in was lit with sort of Œ on the side of Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 102 not in the center, as in many old cities, which will be Œ on the side of the city. And I Œ I was very good in mathematics, and some other things, and I was tutoring some students in mathematics, and Œ and not far from this station. And Œ and then there, as we walk back to my place, says, let™s go around. Those Œ those are the trains where the Œ yesterday thth-they arrested, you know, some they are full, and there are guards, and they™re ready to go to , or wherever they send them. Q: So someone told you, as you™re going back, that Œ first of all, the train station is not in the center of town, it™s on the outskirts, in Bir. A: On the side, sort of. Q: On the side. A: That Œ so we Œ we looked at those trains, you know, wagons, was like five, six and we knew that that™s Œ they will go to , and we Œ Q: And did you see the guards? Did you see guards? A: No, we were to Œ too far to know Œ know. To that we just saw Œ you could see the train. So that™s the Œ the only thing that I Œ I could ever Œ ever under Œ you know, and I don™t remember which ma Œ I don™t think this was Œ because I was not in during that June Œ during that period. Q: During 14 Œ 15 Œ A: I was on the farm. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 103 A: That was during, you see, during the ske Œ school season, I was hol Œ I was in . But during from May Œ end of May, from May to the September, I was always on the farm Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ helping my parents. Q: So, when Œ A: So I know that during that period, we Œ we were tre Œ we heard, you know, the rumors immediately, you re Œ you cannot fast. Q: Okay. So, did anyone from Semeniıkiai get deported? A: No, no. Nobody from Œ but from the Œ from two or three other villages, we know that there were deportations, yes. Q: And Œ A: Families.

Everything send Œ is from the sec Œ changed from the second day, and essentially. Here, for some time, all Œ I mean, they were in Œ Germans were in the war, in the war business.

So, though I Œ I believed that they had planned, and everything prepared what they will do in Lithuania , Latvia . And brought, you know, some people with them, you know, who to do. But they took Œ they could not concentrate Œ they were in action, it™s a concen Œ like an inac Œ they were in a action, not like the Soviets, who came and s Œ an d st Œ and wa Œ stood there. They were there. Here, they were the moo Œ they were moving to Moscow. So they could not, I think, concentrate, could not pay enough attention to everything, to the details.

We talk about the usual Œ you know, you couldn™t see in the Œ Q: Okay, oh you Œ A: Œ if you are in the countryside, you don™t see. Q: So Œ A: But you could hear it. Q: Could you hear it? A: Because farm Œ you know, farmers still went every Monday, to the market. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 115 A: So the farmers had to hear, or had to miss like Œ okay, I know that my mother, every time she came back from the market, she brought us with her Œ used to make special, tiny sort of Œ but very tasty, bagels. And so Œ and those bagels were made by one Jewish family. So, of course, those who are used to buying certain things, the farmers that they need, and then most of the stores, the key stores were owned by Jews. So they Œ they went, and said, where? They could see. They could Œ they could not not miss it. Q: Okay. They could not not see it. A: Yes. Q: Is Œ that™s what you™re saying. A: Yes. Q: Okay. And so the bagels stopped coming. A: The bagels probably stopped coming. Q: Yeah. A: I don™t know, I™m using as an example. Q: I know. I know.

A: I met Œ I went to that summer, someti Œ like, I think was two or three Œ at least two weeks of Œ after the Œ the big, main killing. Q: Okay. A: So, must be somewhere, that means in August, maybe. Or Œ and Œ and the reas Œ I don™t know what the reason, cause I still had my Œ my attic, all my stuff there. And also, I was trying to get a job. Q: Okay. What kind of job? A: Any job, but I ended up Œ now, that™s where my memory fails. Was it next summer that I worked for two weeks in a upper Œ up Œ in a pharmacy. Q: In a pharmacy. A: In a pharmacy. Q: Okay. Okay.

And the reason was, you know, I™m a naïve, country boy. Some Œ I noticed that some very strong, macho guys come in, and they don™t go to the Œ I noticed they come Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 117 they always come to me, not to the young Œ two young women who were also working there.

A: Which made those guys sort of b-blush, and then the Œ the Œ the girls, you know, they took it, and Œ so they thought, oh this crazy, nitwit guy from Œ who needs you here? And so the Œ Q: But this Œ you don™t remember if that was the summer of ™41 or ™42. A: I would have to Œ to really try to trace it somehow. Q: Okay. The summer Œ A: I Œ I had later tried to recreate my Œ where I was, what I did in what period, but that was done like 10 years later, and Œ and it™s just covered Œ I made some mistakes, I would have to Œ to Œ to Œ but I Œ in the Œ and that was like in the Œ must have been Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 118 later Œ I know it was very close to the s-school season. But then I went back Œ back Œ back t-to the Œ to the village, but I think it was thats year. Q: Okay. Let™s Œ let™s still concentrate though, on the summer of ™41. You hear of these things that are happening, of the shootings of the Jews, through, let™s say, trips to the market that your parents would take, and they come back with news. A: Through the Œ you know, through the Œ the people, through the neighbors. Q: Through the people, yeah. A: Yes, yeah, I mean, events like that, I mean, every farmer had friends. Many of the very useful items that the farmers needed, were handled by the Jewish Œ it™s long tradition; they had contact, they could import the Œ and the Lithuanians, you know, after 1918, they were all Œ all new still, in the businesses, they were not good, so that some of the best stores were run with the Jews. Q: Yeah. A: So Œ so the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ they knew that si Œ that something horrible Œ Q: When the Germans had marched in, was there the same feeling of fear, as there had been with the Soviets, amongst people, amongst the farmers, amongst the villages?

They noticed Germans only at Œ with the killing of the Jews. Q: Okay, so it was Œ it was that Œ that non-Jews were left alone, but Jews were immediately Œ were immediately affected. A: Yes, I think so. Q: Immediately rou-rounded up, immediately taken. A: Right, it must be, ye s. Q: Did the people ever talk about anybody in the villages who was involved with this type of activity?

A: I set, I do the proofreading, and I put Œ make up the pages, the layouts, and I did that, and I did it very well. Q: And you mentioned earlier, the difference Œ A: But I had some Œ I had some control about covering of the Œ we Œ of the artistic, you know, activity, because they di Œ they did not know, and they were not interested. So there, I Œ I had some, you know. Q: So does that mean you wrote about cultural things, or you were able to get Œ A: Œ I Œ I Œ I remember Œ no, I Œ I Œ I asked some of the Œ who knew, who were in the field wat Œ because there was r-really somebody else, Patra(ph) (ph) was pulled in also in the same time, and he was very already known poet and writer, so he was like the editor. Q: Okay. A: But there were some little things like okay, I did it first, and very good review Œ I just found, not long ago of the Miltinis theater, in .

But that™s Œ okay, that™s Œ but then I was very much involved in local culture of . I was very interested who came, because okay, we had Bink is, we had Œ we had Janonis . But there were others before. So I did a series of articles on the early Œ in , about early poets of the area, of that. Q: So, if I can Œ A: But so, t hat™s my contribution to . Q: You mentioned earlier that there wa Œ there seemed to be a difference in Œ in censorship. Di Œ when you put the linotype, you know, when you Œ when y Œ not the linotype, when you would arrange, you know, you™d get the articles, and you™d arrange Œ A: And pick up the Œ lay out, yeah Œ Q: Œ the newspa Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 136 A: Œ metal. Q: Yeah, the metal. Was Œ was that already after a censor had looked at those articles? A: No. No, no, no. All this Œ okay, Germans insisted that every local paper, before it™s printed, the main pieces Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ would be summed up in a fo Œ paragraph there, no time to read, and presented to some loc Œ to some person the Germans had in the mayor™s office, as their representative. I have Œ I don™t know the details, how that worked, but that was done already by and Rudise (ph), before they handed to me, the materials. Before Œ because otherwise, suppose they Œ you Œ if you do it later, it will be too late to Œ to Œ because it™s already Œ Q: It™s already set. A: Œ made up. Q: It™s already set. A: So they have Œ what they gave to me was already total Q: By the Germans. A: They did not which was first thing. But they Œ they Œ they insisted. T hat was part of the job of the publishers, Œ Q: Were there Œ were there anti-Semitic articles that the Germans wanted Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 137 A: Ga Œ I was told by wa Œ wa Œ this guy who wrote that article, that Œ not only that he told me, but he se Œ he actually sent me the Œ the clippings, I have some clippings, there were not Œ I think Œ I did not mean to not so directly, but indirectly it was clear that it would Œ those were anti Œ anti-Semitic Œ Q: Pieces. A: Œ pieces, yes. Q: Okay. A: But that was during the Œ the Œ most before the killing. After the killing of Jews, tha Œ you Œ you Œ you Œ you really have to find Œ but I Œ I wouldn™t have Œ I would not bet that in the capital, in some of the Œ maybe newspapers, there was some continuation until Œ for another quite some time. Q: I see. A: But that Œ that I don™t know. But in Œ in Œ in Œ in the local newspapers, in ﬁ The Provincial,ﬂ everybody had already seen where the Germans stand. Q: Okay. A: It™s no joke that this is real. Q: I think one of the sorts of implications, in that piece, in th e ﬁ New York Review of Booksﬂ piece was that you had your own work published in Œ in the same Œ A: In the Œ in the provin Œ vincial Œ in the paper that also printed ththe German ri Œ Q: Anti-Semitic articles. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 138 A: Œ yes, that, but that was normal, and nobody even read those Œ those Œ those cra Œ those pa Œ first pages. That was a Œ without it, you could not publish. And the job that the provincial newspapers, I think that the contribution of the real work of the pro Œ provincial newspapers, during the German occupation, has to be understood, and credi Œ and Œ and Œ and Œ and recognized, how despite the situation and the politics, and the Œ the writers managed to promote the local cultures. It was Œ dealt with local cultures. And that™s why I had the series on Œ on the past, you know, ke Œ arts in the area, thathat Œ that din Œ doesn™t start with us. I mean, there Œ there were this, you know, poets and Œ from the past. Q: Well, you know Œ A: Ah there Œ they did a Œ al so a risky Œ they took chances, devoting all the rest to the local Œ promoting local cultures, and reducing the German space to Œ to Œ to minimal, to usually page one. Q: And you know, when you say the German space, do you also mean Œ A: Because the only oth Œ possibility Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ would be okay, now we have German occupation, so we should not write, should not publish, and let Œ permit them do everything. That will be the other option, you see? Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 139 A: We decided that we™ll do, and we™ll do our way, and we™ll de Œ we will outsmart them, and we™ll just give them crumbs. Q: Was Œ were the LAF Œ li Œ LAF Œ A: Th-Th-That was not discussed, it was Œ Q: No. A: Œ taken for granted. Q: Okay. Frontas , the LAF proclamations, were these the ter Œ A: Where Œ where is that Œ where was it? Q: Lietuvos Œ Lithuanian Activist Front. A: What was that? Q: LAFAS (ph). Have you heard of it before? A: Not then. I heard about it for the first time of the Œ by the guy who wrote the article. Q: I see. Okay. Well, some of Œ A: Because we did not know that there was this provisional Œ provisional ga Œ Q: Government. A: Is that identical provisional government? Q: It was Œ it was the force that started the uprising against the Soviets. A: Yeah, but you see, we did not know even about the uprising. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 140 A: We only kne w that German now came in, and there they are. Q: Okay. A: We did not know, in the villages. In our village, in Semeniıkiai , we did not know. Maybe somebody knew. I didn™t. Q: Did anybody talk about that there was Lithuanian help in getting rid of the Jews, or did they usually phrase Œ A: I Œ I™m reading, and I™m told, and I Œ I Œ you know, I™m one who, when somebody tells me, I believe. Later I descr Œ that has caused me many problems sometimes. Q: Yeah. A: But I believe. If they say that there was some help in Œ the Œ wh-where I doubt is that some of the aspects of that help are taken from the Soviets Œ Soviet sources. There I become immediately very, very skeptical. The participation there, it™s clear there was, but when they say, even if it™s a mild participation, comparatively, so we will Œ we will shoot them. But you grow and protect the property that is left, which is, you know, on direct sort of difference, likely. I Œ which has been picked up from the Soviet sources. The Soviets were masters in impli Œ in making one guilty, inventing reason, you know, so that when one of friends of Atronas(ph) was Œ is ac Œ or maybe his friends, I am told that they were asked to take care, protect the properties. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 141 Q: While the Jews are being shot. A: Yes, Jewish Œ Jewish properties. Q: Yes, yes . A: So, is it true, or is Œ an -and when they say, this they found out from confession during the Soviet investigation, I Œ I don™t know it™s real or not real. They did not like becau se he was part of ‚the six™ in the underground, working against the Soviets. So Œ so there the Œ what otherwise Œ here Œ when especially, when I was already in this Œ in Œ displaced, after the war, in Germany , in displaced person camps Œ and again, you have to read my book, ﬁ I Had Nowhere to Go ,ﬂ some of the young people, between 20 and 27, they were so horrible, they were Œ they could kill anybody an Œ I mean, they could steal, rob, kill. And they came from the Œ some were volunteers in the German army, some were drafted by force, but while in the army, they became like that, but some volunteers. So, I have no doubt that they could have shot Jews, or anybody, with Œ with no blink of the eye. They were so Œ and Œ and I was living among some of them Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ in Œ immediately after the war, because they were, you know, just from the army. Q: Okay. Well, you highlight something Œ A: So I™m Œ I have no doubt that there were some, yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 142 Q: But you don™t Œ you don™t remember hearing about people saying Œ A: No, no. Q: Œ oh, this guy down the street, he was involved. A: No, no, no. Q: Okay. A: No. Q: Okay. A: But again, dodoesn™t m ean that people were not Œ not talking about it, but you had to take it Œ m-my case, individual case Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ that you know, I Œ I was not Œ I was still in my shell. Q: Well, you were in a literary world, not Œ that™s Œ it sounds to me that that™s what you are trying to tell me, is that it was literature and Œ and culture Œ A: That™s all Œ was only one part. My retreat into the shell was caused by my illness. Q: Okay. A: And the illness went me into the mystics. And that™s where Œ in the period when I was totally in Bhagavad Gita , in Krishnamurti , in . I was there. The only book I brought out with me was Bhagavad Gita . We do Œ we do an as Œ translation. Q: No kidding? A: From Lithuanian. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 143 Q: No kidding? A: I was completely in a different world, which later I began trying to libera Œ it™s not good to get lost in mysticism too much. It took me years to Œ to become more real. I™m still not there. I™m still with Eckhart , Meister Eckhart . So that Œ so it™s not only the Œ the literature is Œ it takes yo u over, and you are with Œ with it somehow, your sensibilities are somewhere else, interests somewhere else. It is Œ takes Œ the muses take complete control. Q: But you™ve become more involved in the paper, now with your setting the type, and Œ and Œ A: Not setting the type, those are specialists. Q: Okay. A: No, those are spec Œ oh, that™s a art, in itself. But yes, I was putting the pieces together of the Œ Q: The layout, excuse me, you were Œ A: Œ and Œ and actually, I could not Œ I sometimes Œ there were couple people, and actually, there was one who is Œ was connected. Later, I find this out. Q: Okay. A: And I Œ and I stood by, connected with the provisional govor Œ government, Galvanauskas , you see Œ Q: Galvanauskas . Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 144 A: Galvanau Œ he, Lip , the Œ my publisher, used to bring, you know, together with auditions, all the peo Œ articles by Galvanauskas . And they were all very long and involved, and I could not understand what he was talking about there. But it was Œ I was read Œ you know Œ I Œ before I sent Œ took to the printer, I always read them, because there were many mistakes I had to, you know, correct. Language mistakes. And Œ and I read those ar Œ an -and I could not believe that is giving me to publish this. And two or three times I pass away that him not to publish it. Q: What kind of topics were written in there? A: Very political, the future of Lithuania . I Œ I could not tell Œ they were so above my head. Q: Were they like, we™re together with the Third Reich type of articles? A: Now, now, now, when Œ when Œ when I™m reading, you know, whether , I would like to read, and maybe they were corn Œ maybe they had Œ there, where you could lead it to Œ maybe it came from there.

At that time, all I understood without having any much knowledge about the Œ the Third Reich philosophy of politics, all I knew that there Œ oh, they want to occupy countries, and spread Q: Was it like the Marxist teacher, who was saying to you by rote, that this is what™s important about the revolution?

A: And they were long, also. Q: Oh. All right. So Œ A: Next, I did not know that he was also , or Œ or his bro Œ he had a brother Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ connected with Œ Q: But it sounds like, at this time, you weren™t in any danger, really, through whatever you were doing.

So I became already, technically connected on the ground. They used to give me transcripts Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ from BBC. Q: Okay. A: They gave me special typewriter. Q: Okay. A: Which I had to hide, because Germans were looking for that face, of type face. That was the only way they could detect who is publishing them. So this specific lit Œ little publication, four page, which was a Œ not printed, not set in any of the printing shops, but typed. And then Œ Q: So, in other words, the newspaper Œ A: Œ and then multiplied by what was known as shapierografas (ph). Q: Shapierograf as(ph)?

But that was my job, and the job was because those tr-transcripts were ri Œ ri Œ written fast, they listen and they try to write, and th-they needed a lot of corrections.

And then he was writing short stories, himself. That™s why I thought that maybe the connection is with Œ in Chicago , that guy, which he used to give me to read, because I had, you know, already, a certain reputation, you see. Q: So he shared his shto Œ his stories with you? A: With me. Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 159 Q: Okay. A: And they were very bad. And I Œ I Œ I Œ I never, you know, put him really down, you know. Q: Yeah. A: And so he Œ he respected, somehow, me, and Œ and trusted. Q: Cause that™s a huge trust. A: And plus Œ plus he wou Œ he Œ I have no doubt he was connected again to Vitakunis (ph) and Kavalunas (ph). Q: The people who were in the anti-Soviet underground with you? A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: And Œ and they were also the same on their ger Œ continued Œ so-some of them. Q: Under the German. A: Continued.

A: He sent me any Œ so, I found out from Casper , that he was not a-among ‚ the six.™ That means he came from Kavalunas (ph). So, just trying to put things Œ figure out together, because he never talked. And there sh Œ rishi Œ the secret, you know, was coming to it, was Œ Q: Sure, let™s get there now. A: Œ that Œ so he comes to pick up, and I said no, I could not type, because the typewriter was stolen. He Œ he like Œ he immediately like panicked. I could Œ I Œ I Œ the change that took place on his face, his whole attitude, he Œ he totally panicked, because this Œ he had told me before that, take good care of this typewriter, that this germ Œ you know, the German police is looking Œ military police is looking for that type. So what hit him remains mystery in a way, to me because what Œ his first act was, he came Œ it was raining and they had a raincoat. He pulled out a gun Œ he pulled out a gun, and held it in my face. You™re not fa Œ it™s Œ it™s Œ it too Œ you know what this means, in this Œ it Œ what this means, that this Œ you could be end of Œ not end of me, it could be end of you. You know this. And then, he puts down. What that act Œ I could not Œ even today, I Œ I see, I see that moment, that I don™t Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 161 understand his feel and motivation, but I think it was a Œ like a panic. Sudden realization that this could be in Œ Germans discover, and that he sells it, it™s discovered. I mean, it was Œ it was bad, but his reaction was Œ why didn™t Œ he could have just told me. Why did he take Œ have Œ Q: Why did he pull a gun on you? A: Why did he pull Œ yes. And that, I Œ I™m still, you know, when I remember that moment, I Œ and it™s very vivid, and I™m still see Œ you know, mystery. But I think he sort of Œ it was panic, realization and panic. Something, some Œ and maybe he thought that how he Œ he could have thought that I™m lying, or faking that, because th Œ tha Œ that wouldn™t Œ I mean Œ me Œ I-I-I don™t know, it™s a myst Œ mystery. Q: Did you think that maybe your uncle could have found it? A: No, no. Q: Okay. A: No, he wou Œ my Œ we had very Œ because I told him immediately, I had to tell this. Q: Okay.

A: And that™s what he got for us. Q: And why did you Œ why did he Œ A: Why he got it? Because he was in more Œ mo Œ maybe of five people who spoke German.

Also, he managed, because of his German he ha Œ managed we Œ because I was already the age of the draft Œ being drafted into the army. Q: That™s right. A: And I got the papers to go to the Œ to report. So he said, this is what you do. Here is a bottle of red wine. Take this and tell them that it™s my Œ from Œ from me Œ from him, a present.

A: And then the doctor writes a little piece, and then I showed this piece to my uncle oh, this is Œ this says that you have a bad case of TB, and you cannot be drafted. Q: So the doctor understood immediately? Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 164 A: Yes, because they were craving for wine. In Bir there was no wine, and my uncle had wine, church wine.

And Œ and sort of a friendship developed, and had sort of Œ they had certain kind of respect. Then, one day, when we had too many of those worms, they decided that the barracks should complain to the com Œ first to the ci Œ to the Elmshorn Œ to the German government of Œ that is in charge of the camps and prisoners. Q: So not even to the camp itself, but to the local government in Elmshorn . A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: That had to con Œ control of the barracks. Q: Too many magg ots. A: Too many maggots. Q: Too many maggots in the soup. A: So Œ so this guy, who was a teacher in France , and then he was drafted, and he became a for Œ prisoner, and he was writing poetry, he came to me, and says that we decided in our barracks, that you should be our representative, and go and complain Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 175 about the maggots. I said, why Œ why Œ why Œ why not Œ not you? Why am I to complain here, yeah. But hey Œ and with Œ with no second thought, I said, sure, I will do it. Q: Okay. A: S-So I go, I go to th e Œ who is Œ and there sits this general, I was tau Œ told, just like that, and stares at me, and more or less, so Œ so what?

A: Wonder Œ oh, you know, wa Œ and then he™s Œ begins to talk more, I don™t even understand. And the tone he was talking to me, was like when one talks to a child.

I just Œ they asked me, I did that. I did not think at all that there™s anything that I would be in danger. And Œ Q: Were you? A: No. I did not think at all. I was so naïve, and so innocent. And I think that™s why Œ because you know, th-th-the previous two people who comp Œ complained, they are not here any more. Then I Œ then, it Œ it hit me that, you know. But when they were ask, and when I was doing that, it was very normal to me. I Œ and that™s how naïve I was in Œ about life, even then, yeah. Q: What kind of jobs were you doing there?

And somehow ended up in our Œ and how, I have no idea, but some Italian, captain Œ Capitano , brings him Œ and later I found out he™s Latvian Œ said, can you hide him under your bed for the Interview with Jonas Mekas June 29, 2018 179 night? Again, without thinking, I said sure, I will do that. And the check-ins were not every night. They were quite often, the check-ins. And why I did Œ and then, in the morning, on my way to the factory, because I could not keep him for another night, I said go Œ I™m walking, don™t walk with me, but walk like 20 - 30 steps behind me. And I am passing the railroad station, up from there, it™s up to you. And that™s what I did, and I passed that station, I looked, he was not there, he was somewhere there mixed up Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ trying to tra Œ take a train. So I have no idea what happened to him. But it was possible to do things like that. Q: Yeah. A: When you are stupid. Q: And you don™t have a research every Œ that particular night, you know. A: Yes. Q: Now, the barracks, what did they look like? A: Just shacks, with the Œ just made up and built in one week, or wer Œ three days. Q: And, how many people were Œ A: Double beds for Œ Q: Bunkbeds?

And how many people were to a room? A: Oh, I think Œ well, we have to fix it. You may need another session. Q: Okay. Hang on just a second, let™s cut for a moment. Okay, we™re going to stop for today, and conclude this interview two days from now, on Sunday, July first. We™re stopping at the point where Mr. Mekas is in Elmshorn labor camp, and when we come back, we will continue talking about his experiences there.

Q: In Elmshorn , yes, and you were beginning to describe what the situation was like there. Before we go to that, I want to circle back to your leaving. When you left, it sounds like it was quite Œ in a Œ quite a hurry. That is, the typewriter has been discovered. You Œ your connection to the person who distributed these bulletins from the BBC is very nervous. You tell your uncle Œ A: Yes, and he Œ and I saw it, and he indicated it by pulling out the gun, and putting Œ Q: Pointing it at you. A: Œ at my Œ into my face. So the Œ that moment, I did not Œ I clearly understood his action, but it was Œ later I Œ I thought that that indicated the Œ and also he said, you have to disappear, and disappear fast. So that it was stressed, and I had no cho Œ I Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 182 had to Œ I knew that was indication that I have to follow what he is saying, no joke. There is a gun Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ in my face. Q: Did you remember the name of this person now? A: Now I remember. Q: What was it? A: Ostrauskas . Q: Ostrauskas . A: He was about 22, maybe. Q: Okay. A: He had finished gym Œ gymnasium two years earlier, I think, than Œ than me. Q: But you were sound Œ sounds like the same age. If he was around 22, you were born in 1922, and we™re talking about 1944 at this point. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe I was a year Œ Q: A year, okay. A: Œ or se Œ a year or so. He was just slightly older. Q: Okay. A: But definitely, clearly, he was more involved, and more connected. Q: What was his first name, do you know? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 183 A: That™s more difficult to Œ Q: Okay. So, did you have Œ did you have the opportunity to go back to the farm, before you left? And sa Œ A: Yes, I Œ we Œ we had a time, yes, to Œ to Œ to Œ to say goodbye to Mother and Father. Q: And what about your brothers? A: I did not see them before.

I could not tell him. Q: Okay. A: And he did not know anything about it. Q: So why did he Œ A: But he Œ because not say Œ he was pointing in the Œ in Œ in the large si Œ in at that time, in Œ I think that™s I have to look up his diaries. He was too Œ to German police, he would be equally insec Œ incriminated, cause he also lived in the same attic with me . Q: So, in other words, he would have been hauled in for questioning, at the very least. A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Okay. A: Yes. Q: Okay. Now, you told me that Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 185 A: And then we also had to keep in mi Œ we kept in mind that yes, a month or two or three, but no matter what Germans say, looks like Soviets could be coming back. Soviet Œ you cou Œ with Œ with sa Œ so it was combined almost, yes. Q: Did you ever work in Panev , in the pres Œ A: And it was clear that he would be drafted, yes. Kostas was immediately drafted. Q: So Kostas served in the army, the German army? A: Yes Œ no, no, no Œ Q: No. A: Œ drafted b-by the Soviet army. Q: Oh, so when the Soviets came back Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ he was drafted into their army.

And my father was born in 1868. Q: Oh wow. So, your mother was born in 1887? A: Twenty Œ they were Œ they married, and they were ab out 20 years difference. Q: So your father was really quite old when he had you, and your brother. You know, he wasn™t a young man. A: But, you have to also keep in Œ in mind that my fate Œ the way my fate, my life went, I Œ I married when I was 52. Q: You know, almost in the same wa Œ following the footsteps. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. Did you work at any time Œ A: Everything went Œ and that™s why I say I lost with the quo Œ during that period of occupations, I lost like, regular education. I really had no Œ well, you know, usually you have gymnasium, then university, step by step, and then gradually you become this or that. I did not have that. So I lost the normal growing, like, period. I jumped from child to Œ to Œ to 27, when I was Œ landed in New York , I was 27. So there is almost six, seven, eight, 10 years, totally messed up. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Which then, the way my story goes, I tried, you know, to grab as much as I could, and as fast, like choking, you know, life, what I missed, when I came to New York . Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 188 There was no ending, no Œ I had no day when I did not go to theater, when I th Œ I missed nothing that opened in New York , like for three, four, five years. Q: Did you ever go back to Œ for formal education anywhere? A: No, even the universit Œ they were ne Œ after the war, you know , we™re still in displaced person camp, and the camps are moving, moved around. First , okay . The next, , Mainz . There is a good university, so we enlisted with Adolfas into university. But then a year later, they Œ they moved us to Kassel. So I had to, for like a Œ a year, I commuted, once or twice a week from Kassel to . Q: From Kassel to . A: Yes. And so I go for two or three days, I settle down in ka Œ in Œ in Mainz, and then I go about three, four days back to Œ the food beca Œ the food was delivered in Kassel. I had to pick up the food, and bring my food with me. An-And became eventually, impossible Q: Okay. A: So that type of education Œ Q: What was it that you were studying in Œ A: I started with philosophy, then I change it into literature, with Œ with Œ in reality, I was going to any class that was Œ I could Œ you know, co Œ tha Œ that sounded interesting. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 189 Q: Let™s go back still to Lithuania . Did you ever work at another newspaper, besides , or Naujosios , in ? A: That Œ the last months before I left, maybe for 10 months, or Œ I worked at io Œ . Q: Okay. A: Which was Œ one step sort of more Œ okay, it was edit Œ were edited by like Œ they were an education, Rudise (ph), and , they were, you know, teachers. What their other interests were, I never, you know, def Œ you know, patriots, educate Œ educators. was edited by (ph), who was a writer, and had Œ was very closely connected with the Lithuanian writer Œ artists, writers community. So, it was a more Œ they gave more space to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ he gave it to his friends, and they were writers, so there was Œ it was more like, literary. Still the same Œ the same system, the same like how the fir Œ first page, to the w-war Œ to Germany , and war machinery, bulletins. And then the rest the same, structure, local culture, and Œ Q: And you™re Œ A: Œ but it was the Œ th e Œ the atmosphere mo Œ was more intellectual, because it Œ in , there were several very Œ very important writers and si Œ and science people, like Ivanauskas , there Œ it Œ it was Œ a-and of course, the theater, and Miltinis. It was a different Œ a-and many of the Kaunas people, mostly about Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 190 etcetera, used to come to visit when they went Œ came to to visit their friends. Very often the Œ I could sort of sit in the corner, also, and listen. Q: So what was your involvement with ? A: My function was similar to Œ to Œ to all Œ almost identical with , to Œ to Œ to Œ to put all the pieces, (ph) and his Œ and other sort of assistant editors that he had, prepared for th Œ got all the materials that they passed to me, to Œ to Œ to Œ to take it Œ to put it into the Œ to realizing, that means, give it to the line Œ we Œ there, we had the lineta Œ linotypists already. Q: Okay. A: To type, and then to proofread, to Œ to Œ to some of Œ I did not have to read already all of them, like , when used to pass to me the materials. Sometimes I Œ mo Œ I tried to read them all, and tried to correct pre Œ paneva Œ had already a proofreader, and they had, you know, corrector, so I Œ my function was to see that everything is there, every area, and everyone who™s responsible for local news, for the art, or what™s happening in the Œ in the arts in , that they delivered it on time Œ Q: So Œ A: Œ and then to put it Œ the Œ the Œ the term was, I guess I invented it, technical Œ technical, I-I would say, editor. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 191 Q: Okay, to me it™s Œ it strikes me as that some of what your work was, and tell me if I™m right or wrong, some of your work was as layout Œ A: Yes, yes. Q: Œ you were doing layout work. A: Yes, layout, and Œ Q: And then some Œ and proofing. Proofing was in Œ more in than in , because you had a proofreader in ? A: Yes, yes. Q: But then in , it was more than just layout, it was also responsibility Œ A: In Œ oh, in , all the materials are there already, ready on the Œ my table, to take to the linotypist. The linotypist passes, brings to me, and then I pass it to the proofreader, and then he brings me back, and I take back to the linotypist, he corrects. And then, like a next day or so, 40 hours Œ it™s a weekly Œ 40 hours later, all the metals are there, ready to put it into pages and places. Q: Okay. A: And I Œ and Œ and I did all that. Q: So, within this Œ these responsibilities, did this include the political articles that were required Œ A: Whatever was Œ whatever was there, ended up on Œ on my table, ready to Œ to Œ to Œ if i Œ sometimes with a note that, please read Œ check the language. These writers, Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 192 sometimes, you know Œ I will look, we think it™s okay, but maybe could you check Œ check again. Q: Okay. So Œ A: That™s Œ that™s about it. Q: So Œ A: But everything ended up, you know, on my table. Q: And that™s in , and in ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. So Œ A: that in , I had also sometimes to Œ to Œ I th Œ or this, did not know that something took place in Œ there was a reading, poetry or something, but I knew Œ and I Œ I order Œ I knew who could review it, so I-I had right Œ I had right to also order and engage some writers. Q: To assign articles to other people. A: Assign, yes. Q: Does that Œ A: But in the Œ on-only in the cultural area, in Œ in the local cultural area. Q: So what about Œ is it possible then, that if you had to proofread, and layout, could Œ did Œ were there articles that were anti-Semitic in Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 193 A: Not Œ not Œ not Œ nei Œ neither in , nor , and Œ and I believe same for all Œ all other regional newspapers after the Œ a year after th -the Œ the killing of the Jews, you could really try to find with the various Œ you need a strong light to find anti-Semitic article in any of those papers. Q: In the regional press, you™re saying? A: Yes. The capital, I don™t know. Regional I™m talking only, and I™m Œ I™m quite familiar because I used to get in my little office in , some of those regional papers. Q: But then Œ A: They were all concerned for the local cultures, and they were fed up with Œ they knew where they are, they knew where the Germans are, and Œ and Œ and what the Germans Œ Germans all about. And I Œ I wouldn™ t say a hundred percent, you know, I™m not Œ I did not see everything. But not in , and not in pane Œ . But during the first weeks, I know, because I have seen the clippings. But by the time Œ by the Œ after I ca Œ after the arrest of Petronis , that™s where I really familiar those Œ that that. Q: Okay. A: But indirectly, in Œ in like a kind of a rule kind of way, sent those huge articles by Galvanauskas about the future of, you know, his fantasies of Œ of the western civilization, abru Œ what is behind some of that thinking. I would not Œ I could not Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 194 bet Œ I think some of that had been maybe totalitarian, I don™t know, because the Œ the thinking Œ a-and I told last time that I managed even to keep some out Œ Q: Yes, you did. A: Œ because I could not understand what he™s talking about. Q: So what™s his first name, Galvanauskas ? A: Galva Œ ed Œ this one was Ernestas Galvanauskas . Q: Ernestas Galvanauskas . And he Œ A: There were two or three brothers. Q: Okay. And he was Œ A: And I know that one Galvanauskas appears in the provisional Œ that I discovered now Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ that Galvanauskas appears in there. Q: But you would say that you Œ th-the first year, you did, or did not see Œ A: Now, I we Œ will add that, from what I said, of course, I said this also, what I™m saying now to our friend Michael . Q: Okay, the person who Œ A: Œ he did Œ did not believe any of it. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 195 A: So who am I to talk? At some point I give up, of course, you cannot talk if you Œ the Œ the Œ the person doesn™t believe what you are saying. Q: Okay. A: Because a -all Œ yes, yes, yes. Q: So you were referring to Mr. Michael Casper , who wrote a piece on the Œ in the ﬁNew York Review of Books .ﬂ We™ll talk about that a little later. A: Okay, yes. Q: Okay. Let™s now then proceed to Œ is there anything else about leaving Lithuania , about working in these papers, and about any of those activities, that you didn™t mention before, that you™d like to talk about now, before we go on to Germany ? A: I would still Œ I would add something t Œ about the local newspapers. Q: Okay. A: Because they felt a certain respi Œ responsibility to their regions. And I think that I Œ they have to get credit, some of the people who worked on those pe Œ newspapers, for helping to Œ to keep the local culture going. Q: Yeah. A: And to te Œ and sometimes with even a danger, you had to outsmart Œ outsmart. Sometimes , I mention that some major articles had to summed up briefly, very Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 196 briefly. And there Œ sometimes they Œ they did not exactly translate wrote the way Œ they wrote it the way Germans would be Œ like. Q: Be happy with it. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: And they took chances. And it™s to their credit that Œ that they managed to devote ma Œ most of their Œ the body of their newspapers to that life of not only what was happening at that period, but there is a lot of the past, always, of Œ from pieces on their past cultural personalities of the period, I mean going like Œ going back to , yes. Q: Well, you know, two things come to mind; is that if we™re talking about articles dealing with the past, I think East Europe , if I Œ I™m going to Œ I™m going to kind of bring forth a stereotype, that east Europeans live in the past a lot, for le Œ A: But especially they Œ they Œ that Œ during that time, there was even a need. It was positive, to live in a Œ to go back to the past was positive. Q: Okay. A: Now is no Œ wouldn™t be positive, but under occupations, it was positive to be reminded of Œ of Varpas (ph), and of , etcetera, etcetera Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 197 A: And all their early, or, you know, other personalities that helped to Œ to Œ to become Lithuania , an independent Œ Q: Country. A: Œ country. That was stressed, that usually got a lot of the Œ of space. Q: Here is another thought, though, and it also has a certain parallel into how people in the cultural sphere dealt with in Soviet times, that you have Œ A: Here it™s very Œ totally different, because there you Œ you could not ri Œ choose your own subject, could not choose your s Œ your own theme, and whatever you wrote was the re Œ everything was read, and had to be approved. In Germany , at that period, we don™t know what would have happened later, with, you know, a familiar, and Œ and Œ and know how it was during those two plus years. Because they were in the war, they were too busy. They could Œ they did not have enough personnel, friends, they were all soldiers. Q: That™s right. A: To Œ to control every aspect. They con Œ what would have happened later, I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: Nobody knows. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 198 Q: Yes. But when you™re talking about the Soviets, ye Œ I assume you were meaning the Soviet presence at that time, as well. That is, that was at that time. A: Yes, I™m talking only about the so Œ but th Œ we know also, that it continued. That the control, total control continued near Œ continued until after Khrushchev , maybe, I don™t know. Q: Yeah, that™s Œ that™s what I™m saying, is that in later decades, there was also wiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te Œ in the Soviet Union in general, and this included Lithuania , would Œ would write their perfunctory introductory paragraph, or Œ A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Œ give perfunctory play Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ that was political, and that was acceptable, and then they™d do what they want to, you know. A: Yes, I began noticing that there, somewhere around ™75, or something Œ Q: And so that in some ways, it is saying okay, we will work within the system, because this is all that we™ve got, and we™ll give them their duorkle (ph), their due, and then we™ll Œ A: Yeah, yeah, that™s exactly what the provincial pa-papers did. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 199 Q: Okay. A: They Œ only that that Œ that duorkle (ph) was much smaller. Q: Okay. Let™s see Œ how do you say Œ A: A-A-And Œ and more or less Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ page one, the bulletins, and then information, you know, when the farmers have to deliver grain, or potatoes, you know, that Œ for the army. Q: Okay. A: Things like that. Th-Th-Th-That Œ that came also from the mayor, some Œ so, the mayor™s office, and thth-the Œ the [indecipher presented materials, the first page, maybe sometimes second page, that™s it. Q: Okay, du orkle (ph), how do we say that in English? I can even think Œ A: The Œ the Œ Q: Jeepers. It™s Œ it™s not Œ it™s sort of like taxes, it™s sort like give to Caesar what is Caesar™s, but I don™t know what Œ A: Yeah, but wa Œ give them what they want, more or less, and then forget it. Q: Yeah. A: That™s how, I guess, the readers treated Œ treated those pages, also. Q: But here, I Œ when you talk about that, here is another effect, and that is, perhaps, the price one pays. I mean, there have been a lot of artistic works, whether they™ve Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 200 been in film, or in books, that have talked about, what does it mean to one™s sense of artistic integrity, and also human moral integrity, when you decide to play with the bad guys, whoever they are. A: Yeah, but there are Œ there were an Œ I know, during that period there were at least five poets, and five prose writers, who already had the Œ I think they Œ they go t involved by mistake, b ecause they Œ their first interest in the Soviet Union began before the Soviets came. So they did not even knew Œ know what™s happening there. They were sort of misled. But they were caught, and they Œ they Œ they still believed. Q: You™re talking about those who were left at Œ A: The Œ Mi Œ there are some poets. And we knew already that Œ we used to Œ we did not take them seriously, though there were no Œ they were good craftsmen, and good, sometimes not bad poets s. Q: Okay. A: But they were caught in it. Q: Œ A: But they knew exactly those four, five, six, and Œ a-and Œ and they kept writing, and the Œ the cha Œ the papers kept publishing them, and pushing, and building them up. Q: During the Soviet times? A: Yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 201 Q: During the first Soviet occupation. A: Th-Th-The Germans knew nothing, were not interested in that aspect at all. Q: Okay. A: But the Soviets, they had to control the culture too, and immediately. Q: Okay. A: And they came prepared, with who was the mayor, who is this, who is that. They came ready with their own Œ yes. Q: Okay. So when you™re talking about and , they were so Œ pro-Soviet poets Œ I™m Œ I™m saying this for the camera, and Œ A: Yes, because ja Œ Q: Œ A: Œ wrote a long poem for Stalin . Q: And tell us the essence of what that poem was. A: I don™t remember. I read it, and I forgot it. I read it because I respect her as a poet, but what Œ we were all, you know, could not believe that she did Œ wrote the poem. Q: It was about sta Œ Stalin brings the sun. A: How great Œ of course, it™s a poem, it™s happening, kind of a panegyric, kind of praising and admiring, and oh, he is great, he is fabulous. You know, I don™t remember the poem, I never read it again. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 202 Q: Were there cultural figures, let™s say, than when the Germans came, that pretty much did the same thing with the Germans? That said, Adolf is the future? A: I don™t remember any Œ I don™t remember Œ not in that degree, not Œ I don™t know a single Œ maybe somewhere ba Œ something that I did Œ never saw, but there was no such Œ Q: In the world of culture. A: In the wor Œ y es. Q: Because in the world of Œ of politics, I have had Œ A: Yeah, in politics but I did not know what Œ we did not know, I did not know what was happening. But when I™m Œ I™m reading now, I see some confusion there. Q: Well, I myself have heard a broadcast from 1941, by a Lithuanian who eventually became an emigre, who at the same time as he is broadcasting that we are now independent, we have chased the Russians out, we welcome Œ A: Yeah, but that must have happened during that first month. Q: Yes, it did. A: See, so I don™t blam e Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 203 A: Œ because i -i Œ like having dreams, and finally Œ especially because this followed the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ th-the Œ one of the big, Soviet deportation, you know Œ Q: Yeah, mass deportations. A: Œ pe-period. Q: Okay. A: So I don™t blame. I bet I sort of Œ I don™t blame even those who tra Œ they Œ they were just misled, trying to play some games, even, you know. They went to Berlin Œ now I™m reading, finding. Q: Yeah. A: But this is all like secondhand, so I Œ I don™t know what to Œ what™s real there, you know. Q: Okay, okay. One Œ A: Somebody, someday will row Œ write the real history. Q: They Œ they are doing such things, and that is where men Œ much information is being uncovered that often just wasn™t known. A: Yeah. I just bought a co Œ a few Œ like a month ago, a book in English came out, where I™m finding out much of this information. Q: What did I want to Œ ah, there was one final thought that I wanted to kind of express, to get your views on it. And that is another, let™s say, danger, or gray zone, Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 204 that can appear. I mean, what your Œ what I see in your descriptions of how the regional press worked, how the Œ is that it™s an attempt to bring some non propaganda material into the public sphere. Yet now, when I read, let™s say, or glance at papers from the time, they look particularly dangerous, because the non propaganda sections could legitimize the propaganda sections. Do you see what I™m trying to say? A: No, but we did not see it that way. Q: No, you didn™t Œ A: We did not see it, we did not accept it there, we did not treat it that way. But we thought this you know, this is that, that™s Œ you know. Who cares about that? But this is our Œ this is our culture, this is our paper, and we don™t care about that. It can be disputed, and there can be opinions, but in reality, when you are there, and when you really live in that situation, you try to out Œ outsmart, you Œ of course, you could not publish anything. You close the theaters, you cl Œ you do Œ you just give the milk, give the whatever Germans ask. But that™s not how life goes under a Œ the occupation. People continue try to live, not to be disturbed by it, and try to continue their lives normally, and ignore, and sort of like to fight indirectly, in Œ in very invisible ways, the occupation. The fight is going nonstop, all the time. A-A-An-And try to Œ to Œ to remain quo Œ keep your identity. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 205 A: That ki Œ that critic that you just Œ sort of possible, negative aspect of it, was not really real. Q: No, I™m not saying that Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ I™m not saying that as something that during those times Œ A: But you™re talking to it we Œ Q: Œ but have bi Œ reading it now, 60 years later, I see, for example Œ A: Yeah, but you are now, you are free, you are in America , or live in Lithuania . You are not there. You are from the outside, a different context. And Œ and Œ and you don™t Œ it™s like, okay, I think Michael said, you know, well, why did you really le-leave? Okay, this guy, Ostrauskas told you to go. This is not realizing how serious this situation can be, that to Œ we did not play games. It was not a game in which I was involved. It was in a real situation, as real as the gun under your nose. So you Œ you Œ so, okay okay, you say that I should leave, you know, why should I leave? And also, the German military police looking specicfi Œ specifically for that face Œ typeface, was not a joke. Was no Œ so, it was all real. Now, it™s a little more less like, look Œ it™s like a game. It was not a game. Q: Thank you. Okay. Okay. Let™s go back to Germany . There Œ I think that, if we have other thoughts, or you have other things you want to say about this, we can come back to it Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 206 A: And actually, it was more serious than I thought, at that time, because I was still the Œ like a little bit naïve, just from the village, yeah. Cra Œ okay, back to Elmshorn . Q: Back to Elmshorn . So, in one of your Œ I Œ I remember reading, probably in your book, Nowhere to Go, that you describe going to with your brother, and you find a bookstore, and that you are allowed to go Œ A: Yes, yeah. Q: You know, is th Œ I found that strange. A: No, not that Œ Q: That being in a labor camp, you could do it. A: Œ it was Œ very Œ it Œ the rules were very, very, very strong, but there were areas open where you could go out, as long as you are back by that Œ oh, whenever you left the barracks, you had to go first to the office Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ to the ™s office, and get permission. Q: Okay. A: And he Œ and the permission indicated exactly where you are going, and when you are Œ you must return. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 207 A: So, you could go to a movie. There were limited, also, places that you were allowed. There were some ca Œ cafes, bars, where ma Œ we never went with with Italians Œ you cannot have ita Œ okay, we discovered that the Œ it Œ French, not ital Œ no, French and Italian war prisoners, had different Œ th Œ were there under different conditions. Q: Oh. A: They had different condition than the forced labor workers. Q: A: They could go to bars, they could go Œ still, I think they needed permission to leave the barracks, but they Œ they could Œ they were allowed to get Œ to write home, to receive packages. We were not allowed. We were a much stricter regime. Q: Okay. A: But we could go, you know, know that we were for a permit to go with a bookshop Œ and nobody asked to go to a bookshop, except myself and my brother. So they were looking Œ looking at us amazing Œ with amazement. And Œ and movies. That™s all where we used to Œ Q: Did you go to any movies? Were there any movies playing in in that time? A: Oh, no, no, I™m talking about Elmshorn . Q: Elmshorn , okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 208 A: But Œ and we were permitted, during the Œ some weekend days, maybe sa Œ we-well, the Œ now I can™t remember, I think Sundays Œ all sort of Œ to go during certa Œ certain hours for Œ it took like 20 minutes to reach Altona station, which was the last station left there, and that was the only area not destroyed, and that™s where the bookshops Œ luckily, it was the bookshop area. And that was not destroyed, around the station of Altona . So we Œ we Œ and where Œ very often, when we were the Œ we a Œ we Œ we Œ we tried not to go. We avoided , because whenever we went to the bookshop, it was always air raid. So we used to Œ and the train was always there to Œ to go out of town, and it Œ the Œ and Œ and so usually we ran to the train and Œ and then the train moves Œ moves away, like for a mile, to the suburb, and stops, because they used to bomb running trains. Q: Were you hungry in camp? A: If you get one meat Œ meat Œ if you have a Œ the ration of meat for the week is that you cook Œ can cook it in a spoon. So that™s Œ or if you have soup with worms floating in it Œ Q: Well, I remember you were telling me about that, you know, you were telling about Œ okay. A: So you eat some , you Œ you Œ Q: Were you able to get food on the bla Œ were you able to do anything on the black market? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 209 A: Some people Œ some Lithuanians in the other barracks, I know, they knew how to get some Œ some fish, because there was a lot fish Œ fish around . But we did not have any Œ any contact, you know. Q: About how Œ A: We were not smart enough about Œ Q: About Œ paint a picture of the barracks for me. A: Just a shack that you can build from wood, and Œ and tar. Q: Straw, you mean, or Œ A: In one week, or in three days, and you can kick the, you know, with your fist, the wall, and the fist will be on the other side. Q: And how many people were Œ A: And then there were, in our room there were like 10 cot Œ double Œ double cots, so they were all Œ always about 15 - 20 people. Q: Okay. And about how large do you think the entire complex was? A: It Œ I think there Œ there were Œ I don™t know, three, four, three, four? Four or five structures. I would guess between 300 and 400 people. Q: People? A: Yeah, maybe like one Œ 200 French. Maybe make my gu esses. Maybe like 50 Italians, then 50 or 100 mixed. We were there where Œ during the Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 210 period of the war when the Italians were already enemies of Germany , so there were many Italians, some Belgians, some Dutch. Q: Mm-hm. Were there Russians? A: Most of the Russians were in separate barracks. Q: Were they Russian soldiers? A: But may Œ they were bulgar Œ Bulgarians Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ Romanians, in Œ in our barracks. Q: Do you think Œ do you know whether the Russians were civilians, or prisoners of war, or Œ A: Mixed. Q: Mixed. A: Mixed, mixed. Q: Okay. And were there Poles? A: There were Poles, I know very well, because I managed to get to have, from Lithuania , to take with me, and remain with me in one of my pockets, a watch. Q: Okay. A: And one day when one of the Poles visited me, I stepped out for a moment, and later I discovered that my watch was missing. And the Pole managed to steal the watch. There were Poles. And n-not Œ not many, no, not many. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 211 Q: Okay. A: There were maybe in some other areas. Q: Tell me the Œ you worked, you said at a place called ? A: Yes. Q: What was that Œ that factory, or what was that Œ A: They™re called ma Œ Maschine (ph) Œ maschinen Œ mi Œ maschinfa Œ . Q: Okay. A: They Œ they Œ th-they speciali ze in watched Œ in metal, usually small parts for machine Œ other machineries, sort of, and th-the rumor was going that what we were making, they were just pieces you cou Œ you never could guess what they Œ you could do with those pieces, you had to Œ the dig hole Œ di Œ di Œ drill holes in them, or Œ or polish them in one way or other. Where the rumor was going that they were intended to be Œ th-th Œ they were parts for U-boats. Q: And were there many people who were assigned to that particular factory? A: In our factory there were like fift Œ 50 Œ between sic Œ 50 and 70 workers Q: All from the forced labor camp? A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. And, were you ever assigned Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 212 A: From actually, different camps. Q: Ah. But all around Elmshorn ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And were there any other places you were assigned to work? A: No, only there. Q: Only there. A: From the beginning to the end. Q: Okay. A: Until Œ and that™s when Œ what leads to my Œ us Œ our leading Œ leaving Elmshorn , that during last Œ okay, by Œ by January Œ Q: All right, so let me sp Œ A: Œ a part of Œ yes? Q: Yeah, let me step back just a second, I wanted to anchor this in a certain time frame. You were leaving for Vienna in what month, do you remember? Was it July ™44? A: I have to look up m y wo Œ my book. Q: No, I think it was July. A: Somewhere there. Q: Yeah, July ™44. So that means July, August, September, October , November, December, yes, January is the eighth month. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 213 A: January, February, somewhere there. Yeah, already by January, the factory began running out of supplies. Q: Okay. This is the winter of ™45. A: Because the bomb other factories. They could not get metal, they could not get thi Œ so suddenly, from 16 hours a day of work, or somewhere there, they began cutting. First they cut one hour, then another hour, and of course, the more hours they cut, as they were cutting down, our Œ our spirits got Œ went the same spee d up. We knew that o h, they™re running out of stuff. Q: Yeah. A: But, well, that was not much better than the work, because you still had to be there, and many hours, and Œ and since there was no more materials to really do the work on those pieces, they Œ we had like to keep cleaning. Keep cleaning and cleaning, and like i-it was, we came so bor Œ to work, you will work, you do, automatically you begin to forget even that you are working. You begin to dream, and your future fa Œ fantasies. But when you just cleaning and cleaning, the boredom of it is Œ is Œ is Œ is suffering. Q: Okay. And so Œ A: So eventually Œ and that™s when we concocted a Œ when it was reduced to like five or six hours of actual work, and the rest was cleaning, we thought, with Adolfas what Œ okay, when we came Œ when we left with Œ on the same train Œ not on the Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 214 same, had later somehow, they joined Œ they transferred from some other train, into our train, two Karaims , Tinfavichas (ph). And then, when we arrived, already they brought us to Elmshorn , we found that there was one Œ one more Lithuanian, and he was Œ and I knew him from Bir. He was a young graduate of medical school in Riga, de , Jonas , who was very, very, very, very bright, he spoke many Œ Riga had at that time Œ was a university where you could study Sanskrit, you could Œ oriental languages and philosophies and Œ and he spoke them all, and he was in music. We learned really a lot from him. So for some time they put him into our barracks, also. And it™s from him Œ and he was very close to Œ , prof Œ Professor was a Œ a Œ a te Œ te-teaching in Kaunas , and there was some religious institute, a Protestant religion institute, and he was quite, you know, prominent in his field in Lithuania . And he had the top Œ when some of the intellectuals left the be Œ because they™re so Œ so even he left a Œ during the first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and Œ and settled down in lud Œ in hoi Œ Holstein Œ Q: Oh, Schleswig-Holstein ? A: Schleswig-Holstein . And Kreg knew him, and the Œ a-a-and he was ver Œ was respected by local Germans there, and they Œ he persuaded them to give Œ to crack the Œ to Œ a job in one of the local hospitals Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 215 A: Œ because he was a medical Œ you know, he had just graduated. So he ended up here in Œ in Schleswig-Holstein , in Œ in Œ in that area. But before he left, he said, if one day you want to try to Œ to Œ to Œ if you think it™s realistic to run to Sweden to escape, I will give you some leads. He Œ he knew beca Œ f rom Riga , during his studies, he had made contacts with Œ with Sweden . So, but he said Œ but first if Œ before you go, go to and we Œ and Œ and s-see me, and I will give you then the last, latest contacts to the boats that could take you to Sweden from schwa Œ from Œ Q: Schleswig-hol Œ A: Yes. Q: Schleswig-Holstein . A: From a Œ from a Œ a town just across, on the other side of the border. Q: Kiel? A: Denmark . Q: In Denmark . Oh, okay. A: No. So, we Œ we talked. Somehow when the Œ the hours became shorter, we thought, why don™t we tell brothers Neunert that since there is no work here, you know, we could Œ maybe we™re willing to go to Œ to Œ to Œ they could send us to Kiel. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 216 A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that Kiel was bombed almost every day, every night. So somehow, I Œ he did not know what to do with the workers. Q: Because they™re all cleaning, they have nothing else to do. A: Yes. Q: Okay. A: So, I think the idea came first Œ we overheard from him, that he was with his brother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to be a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never liked, he was o Œ and he, that helped me Œ you see, I had the machine, I was working with the machine. I all Œ always had little pieces of paper with German let Œ with German words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a teacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out Œ out what do do with the workers, and that™s when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said, oh, yes, I think we Œ we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because there they still have materials. Q: How did you know that Kiel was being bombed? A: It was not very far from us. Q: Okay. A: All the workers knew, everybody was, don™t go there, don™t go there. Q: And did Œ was there anybody Œ did you get broadcasts from anywhere? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 217 A: No. Q: No. A: No. Q: Okay. A: Only news Œ local, that Œ the Œ the newspapers. Q: Okay. A: So Œ and so wa Œ one day, th e Neu -Neunerts call us in, said Œ and give papers to us which tell Œ it™s clearly written that we are Œ that please permit to travel there, and that we™re going, it say, to Kiel, to that Œ to a factory so and so, and Œ and Œ and that™s it. So we said okay, we go. But on our way, as we Œ where we crossed the riv Œ river, we got rid of our documents, and we continued to . Q: Okay, okay. A: Naïvely thinking that, you know, we can very easily Œ but before that, we continued to , and from there to Œ we walked to Husum . Q: Husum , okay. A: Where lived. Q: Lived, okay. A: And he gave us some information where we Œ whom to meet on the other side of the border. So we go back to , we board the train to cross Œ that was going towards Denmark . But just before we boarded the train, and the police comes and Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 218 asks for our papers. So we had the basic papers fro Œ that Germans had given to all their workers. So that it Œ identification was there, but the fact that wet Œ we™re supposed to report to Kiel , that was not there. They Œ that did not know. So, is it Œ no, you cannot Œ you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we Œ we walk around, and we took our time, we walk around, and we Œ we go into like two or three wagons, la Œ and we Œ and we Œ we walked there around, and we Œ we Œ we sort of jumped into Œ on a train that was already like moving out. But it Œ like in 15 minutes we realized that it was not going to Denmark , it was going back to Œ to Schleswig , or Œ or another town, back to where you Œ we came from. Q: Someplace in Œ in Schleswig -Holstein. A: Yes. But then we Œ we also noticed that this Œ every station, every train was full of German refugees, that there was Œ it was already Œ there were so many Germans running from the eastern parts, that already like was beginning of the chaos there. So we said, why don™t we mix up with them? Q: And did you? A: And that™s what we did. Q: Okay. A: This is all like taking chances, but it was easy to take those chances, because we noticed that even the police could not control any more. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 219 Q: Did you have any Lithuanian documents when you left Lithuania ? Any passport Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ I.D.s? A: A Œ a Œ a liudijimas . Not Œ not a passport, but one page with the photograph and name. Q: So it is a Œ sort of like a declaration. A: Yes. Q: A Œ a Œ an I.D. paper, is that what it was? A: Yes. Q: And who issued that? What kind of authority issued that? A: I would Œ I still have it, so I could Œ Q: You still have it? Okay. A: Yes, yes. In Œ in Œ in Bir, in the mayor™s office. Q: Okay. A: In then we also noticed that th Œ when Germans run, they run in very organized way. They Œ they Œ they knew Œ everybody knew in what school they can sleep. Their schools were made into Œ you know, they were closed by that time. And Œ and where they could, if they want get Œ get Œ stay with some families Œ so we Œ we Œ we Œ we Œ we Œ we kept pushing and look and we discovered that there were Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 220 Œ that they were sending to the school Œ to the school, so said, why don™t we join them, very well. So we ended up sleeping in that school, together with all the others, a-and Œ and that™s as wa Œ you know, what are you do? Running. W e are also like Œ we got Œ said Œ from the Q: From Prussia , yeah. A: Yes. And not much but then Œ and then, even we were Œ we were still sleeping, we hear that some farmer, local farmer, walked into there, into the space, and he™s asking if there any Œ any workers who know the farmer Œ farm work. We need workers. That was spring. Now it™s spr Œ Q: Oh, so now Œ so now we™re coming Œ it™s January, February, March, or something like that. A: Now or April, somewhere there. Q: You™re in April, okay. A: It™s in my book. Q: Okay. A: So, we Œ we meet at the yes, yes. Q: Okay. A: And we the Œ so the farmer takes us to his farm. Q: And what was your Œ conditions there? A: And that was like a Œ it was like a paradise on that Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 221 Q: Really? A: Yes, because the farmer, an old farmer, by himself with like 10 cows, and two, three horses there, and he cannot handle it, and he™s Œ his wi-wife is sort of invalid. But his mother, who was pretty old, he Œ she was like a Œ she embraced all us like her children. She had the Œ immediately cooked a chicken, or sa Œ as Œ a-and Œ and we became like her children. Q: So is this the first decent meal in Germany ? A: Yes, we could not believe it. And suddenly we are in the Œ and the closest, you know, police, or whatever, it was like five, six, seven miles away. It was just in the countryside, it™s very, very remote area. It was Œ and that™s where we stayed, until the end. We did not eve Œ we missed even the end of the war. Q: Did you? A: We discovered, only like three, four, five days later that the war had ended. Q: So it was that quiet, and that remote? A: Yes, yes. Q: Do you know the name of the village that it was? A: I had it Œ have it Œ Thiessen was the name on the family, Havetoft was the village. Q: Havetoft ? A: Yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 222 Q: Thiessen family , Havetoft village. A: Yes. Q: In Schleswig -Holstein? A: Yeah, yeah . Q: Okay. And who told you that the war ended? A: We heard from the local newspaper, we heard. Q: And when was the first time you saw soldiers? Allied forces? A: On our way to when w e Œ we did not see any soldiers on the way, we and Œ we Œ we read in the paper Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ that they are already in . I live Œ and the farmer then Œ then told us, also, Thiessen , that Œ yeah, he there, for I think a day or two or three, he did not know himself, until settled, and it was clear. Q: Okay. A: So then Œ then he told us, you know, you can stay. And we Œ but we stayed, we did not rush, because it was still Œ we believed, maybe chaotic. So we stayed another three or four days Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ and then he packed Œ we packed our books, and he gave Œ with his best horse, he himself took us to . And that™s when we saw Œ we met Œ we were drive Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 223 Œ going into , and from there were hundreds and hundreds of soldiers, some of them even had guns, because the Œ they were, you know, already prisoners. Q: German soldiers, prisoners of war. A: Wi -With Œ with like hundreds of Œ and maybe three or four British guys guarding them, because Œ Q: Is Œ excuse me, my geography fails me here, is north of ? A: Yes. Q: Okay. Is it Œ A: On the very border of the Denmark . Q: Oh, Denmark , okay, all right. A: Because soldiers were Œ ha Œ they were all fed up. T hey Œ they Œ the British knew that they™re not going to fight any more. Q: Okay. So from there Œ A: So keep your gun, who cares? Q: Wow. Did they Œ so, this farmer takes you there, and where is Œ A: And then we Œ we Œ for Œ had given us name of one of his friends who lived in Œ Q: So this is ? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 224 A: Œ in a private apartment. Q: Yeah. A: He was also a doctor. Q: Okay. A: So we stayed for two or three dag Œ days in there with the doc Œ this other doctor. And then Œ and we found out where the Œ the Œ the Œ they are collecting the Œ all the refugees, th-the British immediately established a Œ you know, a Œ a usual a Œ th Œ the army barracks. Q: So they Œ A: And we went there. Q: And so then you became official displaced persons? A: Yes. Q: Were you issued any kind of I.D.s by those authorities? A: Yes, and then already there were Lithuanians Œ lith Œ or Œ or had their own Œ th Œ in exile, their Œ Germany had created their own centers, very fast, and issued a li Œ li Œ sort of mini passports of that, which said, I am a Lithuanian, I™m a refugee, and I Œ I refuse Œ this was the Œ I Œ I refuse to go back to Lithuania un-under the Soviet wic Œ regime that was reestablished there. And why? Because at the same time, like for Œ there were, you know, all those millions of Russian war prisoners, and forced laborers, and immediately the Soviets had, you know, made a deal with the Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 225 Americans and British, that they should all go back. They shouldn™t go back, and Œ and the Œ the train, after tra-train full, like immediately began Œ Q: Did you see this? Did you see such trains? A: Yes, yes, and not only seen, I have experienced stones on myself, on my head, fo Œ thrown by the Œ the Russians going back t Œ home. The Œ first they stayed in Œ in the same barracks, and many of them Œ a-and Œ and I Œ I had many conversations with many of them. Q: With the Russians? A: Yes. Who were like Œ who was desperate to decide to go, or not to go, to go, or not to go back. But then they usually ended up at, oh, it™s bad, you know, and we have this Œ this guy, this criminal, this is our king. But Russia still is my home. So I Œ I go. I don™t know what will happen to me, but I™m g Œ I have to go. But then, every train, every, was supervised by Œ in all those groups, they were Œ who were dedicated members of the communist party. And they™re all in charge of those trains full of Russians. And they immediately put flowers all around, that the joy of going back home, and Œ and may have forced them to sing Œ to sing, and Œ and not only that, when we stood and looked there, they Œ they Œ they threw stones at us. Q: So it was Œ A: You are remaining here. We are going home to this great Soviet Union , and you are here. They used to throw stones at us. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 226 Q: So it was the guard, these sort of soldiers Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ not the ones who were going back, who were throwing the stones? A: No, the guards. Q: The guards. A: By force. They were taken home by force. Q: Any lithi Œ A: And they were afraid that at the same time they considered that, you know, Lithuania is part of Soviet una Œ Union, many Lithuanians did not sleep during that pa Œ period, in the barracks at all. That they Œ they took them, they may take us also. Q: Okay. So, you were esta Œ were you afraid of this? A: Yes, we were very careful, yes. Q: How long did this period last? A: Like two months. Within two or three months, all the Russians were take Œ sent back. Q: So that was the reason for that paper, that identification for the allies Œ A: Yes, yes. Q: Œ that we don™t want to go. A: Yes. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 227 A: I have that too, also. Q: It™s an important piece. Did you stay in this particular displaced persons™ area? A: Moved Œ sa Œ we stayed in for maybe a month. And then we thought, we are stuck here. I-I mean , what Œ and Œ an d there was nothing there. So then, why don™t we go tra Œ somehow, to the south, to the American zone. So we were Œ bought bikes, and we again Œ because they said, you cannot go, there are no Œ there are no bridges, no Œ how can yo u go, even with a bike? So we managed to reach on bikes, , which is like 30 miles or so, through the center Œ Q: Not exactly the south of Germany . A: And then Œ then we got rid with Œ we cannot go any further on ba Œ our bikes. So we stayed in rg for maybe a month or so, and then Œ then we had enough of all Œ because there was nothing left of the city, you know. So we just decided to go on the train and try to go to Œ to Œ to the south, as far as we can. Q: Did you have anything like mon ey? A: We had some money, and the money was Œ and this remained so for almost until we left for New York , for five years, cigarettes.

A: We had a dream already, somewhere around, at that time, the first dream was to go to Israel and start a movie industry. Q: And why Israel ?

Q: And this was in 19 Œ after 1948 that you did this? When Israel is Œ A: I have to look up, it™s in my diary. It™s in my book. Q: Oh. The reason why I ask is that before 1948, it would have been the British, and then after 1948, Israel was already independent. A: Yeah Œ no, it was already independent. Q: Okay. A: That™s why we wanted to go. Q: Okay. A: This was going to help the new country, see? Q: Okay. A: We were the naïve idealists, sort of. So Œ so we go back to the barracks, say okay, so what™s next? And then my brother Adolfas jumps up, I remember. Says, oh, we can go to Egypt , and then we can, from Egypt , we can walk to I-Israel . You know Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 235 how naïve we were? So, next day, good idea, and we go to the Egypt , and to the Egyptians.

A: No, no, no, I don™t know what we said, we just wanted to work there, to Œ and they must need workers or something. And then we don™t tell, you know, our dreams. We don™t te ll that we want Œ want to go to Israel . We don™t know their relation. So they look up, they Œ they Œ they look Œ they Œ they treat us already, seriously, says, yeah, we™ll see. And then the secretary, the person in charge comes back, says, oh, why didn™t you come yesterday? There were three places left, and they were Œ and they were taken by your other friends, Lithuanians. So, back we go. Years later Œ years later, I Œ I had little correspondence with Greimas . Q: Mm-hm. Greimas is?

Then he returned to Lithuania , and well, there are people who knew when he was still Œ before he left Lithuania , and that was some Œ I don™t know exactly when he left Lithuania , but Œ Q: But was he a refugee? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 237 A: Œ during this Œ during the Œ these correspondence questions, answers, and Œ and meetings with Michael Œ Michael Œ oh, what is it?

And Œ and I™m Œ this Œ a-and one of the Œ some of the odd le tters, materials that I have received, are Œ express great anger Œ anger about Greimas Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ who supposedly Œ I do not kn-know the details Œ had Œ has said some Œ made statements that could be interpreted as anti-Semitic. Q: Okay. A: So there are, in Lithuania today, there are Œ there are people, there are Œ who are still watching, researching deeper and deeper into the past, you know, who did what, who contributed to the Œ an Œ to the Holocaust. Who Œ I know that during one of the recent conferen ces Œ Greimas died Œ actually, I was supposed to meet him in Paris . That was 10 years ago, or more. And on the train Œ or, on the plane, I pick up the newspaper from there, and ﬁ Le Monde ,ﬂ and says, Greimas died yesterday. So, I Œ and I™m there, and going to Paris Œ not specifically to meet him, but on that trip, I was planning Œ I had Œ planning to meet him. But, there was a Œ a memorial, some event for Greimas , international event, I don™t know in what city or country. And Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 238 there was this representative also from Lithuania , representing the linguists of Lithuania , linguistics in Lithuania . And during the conference, this Œ honoring Greimas , he stood up and denounced openly to the conference, that he was anti-se Œ Semite, and how do you honor him now? Q: I see. A: And for which he was very reprimanded, very much dis Œ so I don™t know what documentation, what he has said, but there is this aspect there, which I want you to know. Q: Okay. Thank you. Because I was not familiar with Professor Greimas . I did not know of Œ I know the name Œ A: No, he™s one of the really Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ most important Œ Q: Yes, of course, I know her. A: and Greimas are the two maybe most important Lithuanian kind of scientists in Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ from that generation. Q: Okay, so let™s go back to, you™re stuck again in your barracks, because Israel is not a Œ a possibility, Egypt is not a possibility. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 239 A: Oh, eventually said, okay, so may as well we stay here until they Œ those who run camps decide whe re to take us. Q: Okay. A: Because we have no profession, and we are totally Œ you know, we can do anything, or nothing. So we continued staying until they moved that fr Œ this was in Kassel. So to sh Œ until suddenly, from the blue sky, we are Œ we Œ we Œ we con Œ were contacted in Kassel by the government of the Œ by UNRRA, and Œ and Œ and then we were informed that Œ that a certain Variokojos (ph), he Œ who Œ who I discovered later was from , a banker, he was running a bank in , who had heard Œ you know, he had heard, because we had already published, you know, books, etcetera, in Kassel Œ that we are in Kassel , and we are from , he knew that. He made up papers, that was another way. If you wer Œ you™re ra Œ if your relatives in United States or some other country, pay for your travel, and you have place for you to stay and a job Œ job was the condition, and the place, that he made Œ he was living, watching, had some business in Chicago , and he had persuaded area there som ewhere, a Œ a b aker, to give jobs to me and my brother, and Œ Q: In the bakery. A: In the bakery, and he paid Œ he arranged the whole trip, he paid, and had rented apartment for us too Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 240 Q: In Chicago . A: Œ in Chicago , to come to Chicago . Like oh, Chicago , okay, let™s go to Chicago . Q: So, was he a banker in , or Œ A: In . Q: Okay. A: What he did in Chicago , I have no idea. Q: Okay. But he knew you from those days? From days? A: No, I knew the name. Q: Okay. A: I knew the name, a-a-and [i or something. Q: And then Œ so it suggests that he was rather well-to-do, when he was in , if he had a bank. A: Or maybe he became even wealthier in Chicago , who knows? Q: You never know. A: Yes. Q: Question though Œ A: But he would Œ did a good Œ you know Œ we had not Variokojos (ph), I wouldn™t be sitting here with you. Q: You toast Variokojos (ph) Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 241 A: Oh, and while Œ because Œ in between si Œ this was a Œ one day we woke up, and we said, oh maybe it would be Œ be good to work on a ship, since nobody wants us. So we went to a French ship company representative, then we li Œ we were practically hired to work on the ship bef Œ between the harbor and Œ and Sydney . And we were just waiting to be called, on the ship. That™s when this Variokojos (ph) invitation from now we had to decide. Oh, let™s go to America . Q: Okay. Now, you mentioned something that I had not asked you about, and that is your cultural activities while you™re in the displaced persons™ camps. Can you tell me, you know Œ A: Stupid, those activities. Q: Really? A: Stupidity dragged me into Œ into acti Œ always into activities, stupidity. As soon as we Œ Q: Okay, what were some of those Œ A: Œ a-as soon as we arrived in , like maybe a week later, there is an announcement that there is a Œ the Œ the cultural committee of the Œ of the camp, is meeting, all those who are interested should come. And it was, I think, run by a certain ben Œ Professor Bend orius . Q: Bendorius , mm-hm. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 242 A: Be Œ jo Œ professor of geography. Q: Okay. A: So, we come there, and there are some 15 people, we don™t know who they are, but there were two other people there that I had already met Œ met my second day. And that was Œ Q: Oh yeah. A: Œ who became later playwright. Q: Playwright, and Œ A: And Leonas (ph) who was a Œ like a mase Œ a painter, artist. And they™re there, also. So there Œ the bent wa Œ discussion that we should do this and that and that, th-th-th Œ inform people, you know. But one thing is needed is some daily bulletin. So, is there somebody here who Œ who would Œ could Œ Q: Put together a daily bulletin? A: Yeah. So, he looks around, and Œ and looks at me. Okay, I will do it, I says, I will do it. And that™s how I engaged to edit a daily bulletin for Œ Q: And what was it called, this daily bulletin? A: Oh, Œ Œ . Q: So the news of . A: Yeah. Q: . Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 243 A: But the information from UNRRA , everything. And later even, you know, had one page. Sometimes weekend only had four pages, one page for children. And like a miniature newspaper. Q: Was there any news Œ A: And then later Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ Bendorius used to laugh and tell, you know, said oh, you know, we Œ I had Œ we had this meeting, and we Œ and you know what one Œ there is nobody who will do it. Then I will see this Œ this shabby kid in the corner, and he says, he will do it. And I thought it™s a joke. Q: But he did it, yeah. Was there any news at all Œ A: Then, if you Œ Q: Whoops, okay. A: No, that™s not the end. Q: Okay. A: Then, that was already like five, six months later. You see, those camps were not just, you know, simple people, workers, or some like people, like mixed, kind of. They were ver Œ there were some in that camp, in , there were at Œ at least 10 top professors, professionals from the U niversity of Kaunas aal -alone. So again, Bendorius was very active, had a meeting, and we said, we should have like Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 244 people should wear Œ people™s kind of university. You know, we have all these people here, specialists, authorities in various subjects, so we could have a series of lectures. So, again he looks, and nobody wants to do it. Then Bendorius over there, you pes Œ do you want to do it? I said, okay, I will do it. Q: Okay. So that means you became the organizer? A: So a camp university, call, in . So when we mo Œ they moved us to Kassel but then the same, I continued in Kassel . Q: Okay. A: Continued not the university aspect, but the Œ the Œ the bulletin, the camp bulletin. Kas Œ I still have, I think, what number of issues Q: Oh really? A: Yes. Q: I know th-that Œ that those would be very valuable. A: And then of course, already, the literary activity were in , and Hannover , and other places, they™re Lithuanian, you know, intellectual community, and journalists organized them Œ themselves, writers. Th Œ they Œ the wa Œ monthly magazine was Œ they began publishing. Q: What was it called? A: ﬁAidai.ﬂ Q: ﬁAidai, Aidaiﬂ Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 245 A: ﬁAidai.ﬂ Q: Œ which means echoes, echoes. A: And Œ and one of the problems was that there were no Œ there were already appearing Œ there were books for grown-ups, you know, but nothing for children. So this guy, Giedraitis , in Kassel, said why don™t you help me to prepare some books for Œ fairy tales, something for children. So, as you can Œ I Œ I do Œ I didn™t have to tell you Œ Q: You vol Œ you said okay. A: I said yes. Q: Okay. A: So, I began, organizing and publishing. And we published, you know, with shafirografas (ph), cop Œ multiplications Œ Q: Oh, wi Œ how do you say it in Lithuanian? A: Shap Œ shafirografas (ph). Q: Shafirografas (ph)? Which I Œ I take to mean a mideo Œ mimeograph machine. You mentioned earlier Œ A: Ka Œ kind of, kind of. You type on stencils. Q: Okay. Okay. A: And was li Œ , those were my buddies, they Œ because I needed some help already. The projects were expanding. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 246 Q: What did I want to ask? Yes. Was there any news at all coming from Lithuania ? A: I had my own journal, you know, it started pa Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ we became very Œ quite controversial, ﬁ ,ﬂ liter Œ literary magazine. Q: ﬁ .ﬂ And how did it become controversial? A: Because of its content. We concentrated on modern literature, not what was happening in the west. Q: Ah, okay. A: And the Œ the Lithuanian literary community thought we were too avant-garde. Q: Okay. A: I can show you some later, some issues. Q: Any news from Lithuania during this time, during these years in the DP camps? A: No. Q: Okay. A: I Œ you could not Œ the first time that we could dro Œ could write to th e family, was when I was already published in film culture, and Œ and al Œ ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino ,ﬂ in Moskva knew about the magazine, and used to visit me in New York , and Œ and asked also to write for ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino .ﬂ Q: How do we translate that into English? A: Ke Œ kenom Œ the art of ke Œ of Œ of cinema. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 247 Q: So , iskusstvo means the art of, okay, art. A: Art. Iskusstvo and kino . Q: And kino , okay. A: And so on Œ the Œ the Œ the art of film. Q: Okay. That would have been Œ A: So they knew that they Œ and now I™m safe, maybe. Maybe I™m safe, and that™s when we th Œ slowly we li Œ correspondence. Q: Was this the 1960s? A: Yes, in the 60s. What year, I would, you know, I ha Œ I had the first issue of you know, where Œ with one of my report from New York . Q: So you wrote for them? A: Yes, a report on the Œ on cinema. Q: Okay. A: They ask me, and I did it. Q: Okay. A: It™s their main film publication. Q: For the Soviet Union . A: Yes. Q: Okay. What did I want to ask now? So, we ask Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 248 A: And that™s when I Œ at Chicago Lithuanian community began calling me a communist. Q: You never know how an Œ avant -garde can become controversial. I want to go back to another point, and I want you to describe for me, if you can Œ people, you know, have i mages that Œ of a group, and sometimes they get reduced to stereotypes, and sometimes those stereotypes happen to have truth to them, you know? A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: And one image that stays in my mind is what a Œ what you had said earlier, during the first part of our interview, when we talked, and I asked, did you know of anybody who had participated in crimes against the Jews, who ha Œ could have been Œ A: No, I can tell you right now. Q: You didn™t. A: No. Q: You didn™t. A: No. But from Michael Œ Michael Œ Michael Œ his last name always falls Œ has written to me, has said that some of the people that I knew had practiced . Like the po Œ and in which way? Not in crimes, in the Œ that the poet Matuzevicius (ph), who had Œ was in the Œ from gymnasium Bir, two or three years earlier than me , and some of his friends Œ and so I understood from Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 249 Michael that he has Œ that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the shooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home Œ their home belongings Q: Okay, their Œ their items, their assets, yeah. A: Their assets. So that is the Œ so I Œ I kn ew, and Œ and actually admired li Œ like the Œ like the younger, budding, you know, poets cal Œ you know, want to be published, and want to be know Œ every young poet wants the Œ and has it Œ some people, close, that he Œ older poets that he or she admires. At that time Matuzevic ius (ph) was the poet of . He was the young, like . And he was good, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to , etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who Œ who were writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was Œ when I heard this from Michael , to me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of ‚ the six.™ He said Œ so, in those six Œ and he wrote a poem about six with Œ which was pub-published in , at Œ I don™t know what Œ what Œ what month. And ‚the six™ became like heroes. People did not know that such Œ that they existed, when Œ and they found out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of them later, I Œ I Œ I don™t know, but I think they were instrumental to Œ to star Œ help others to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like Œ like those six who worked against the Soviets. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 250 Q: Okay. A: Now, I thought it was Œ when I read it, I thought I Œ I als-also like admired that they did it, but I also thought, why is he publishing this? Though they Œ he did not name the names. The poem does not name names. But I thought Œ I didn™t know Œ of course, already, you see, I was in Œ connected to the underground, my own Œ Q: So Œ A: Œ by distributing leaflets, that is why. And then, this was already under Germans. And then, somehow it was clear that this was like wrong time to Œ to publish some Œ something like that. Q: So what you Œ if I interpret what you™re saying, is that Matuzevi cius (ph) was a poet you admired Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ before then, with the Soviets, he works underground Œ A: Underground, yes. Q: Œ against the Soviets, he™s one of ‚the six.™ A: Yes. Q: When the Germans come, he publishes a poem ab out this Œ A: Six. Q: Œ underground six. A: Yes. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 251 Q: And you were thinking, this is not the right time to publish Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ your connection to ‚the six.™ A: Yes. Q: Whatever that would have been. A: Yes, and later on I said Œ it was always what Œ why Œ why did he did that? Q: And the next time is when Michael Casper , who has written the ﬁ New York Review of Books ,ﬂ article, mentions to you, shows you that he had confessed un Œ in a Soviet trial. A: Yeah, but you see, that Œ whatever is confessed to the Soviets, I never take it for real money. Q: Okay. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. But I started this questioning for a different question. And that was about Œ A: But I ended Œ your Œ your question ended up very simple, in three or four word, do I know anybody who killed, or committed criminal acts against Œ Q: I didn™t finish the question, though. A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: Well, and I said Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 252 Q: No. A: No, I did not know, cause Œ yeah. Q: But the Œ what I wanted to say with that, is that when you answered this in part one of our interview, you said that, but in the DP camps Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ you had met some people who very Œ you could Œ A: Whom I believed could have been. Q: Were capable of it. A: Yes. Q: Were capable of it. A: Yes, yes. Q: And Œ and so there™s an Œ A: No, there i Œ was another Œ this was in Œ in , when I was still in . Q: Okay. A: Because that™s where the la-last resistance against, I guess the divisions, German divisions that fought English army Œ the army came from Denmark . Q: Okay. A: So that™s where they ended up, and th-that™s where they were released, including those Lithuanians. And Œ and there was this Lithuanian general, very educated, very Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 253 educated person, Daukantas . Daukantas . Whom I had never heard about, but I met him there, in the camp, though he Œ Germans did that, put Œ if one Œ if a Lithuanian was a general of that stature, ger Œ Germans, even if that Lithuanian or any other Œ from any other country, was of that military stature, Germans respected Œ had so much admiration for the army, they used to give them special, individual apartments. But English did the same. They gave to Daukantas a Œ a room.

Q: Œ because I think it™s rather short. Is it Œ A: But those fi Œ reme Œ those young, criminal types from the army, just released Œ Q: German army. A: Œ from the German army, some of them, they were drafted, and we came like that in the army, those ca Œ the army can, as Œ as you know from Vietnam , can change one into criminal.

My question was really geared to DPs . So, I wanted to kind of see if there™s a characteristic of DPs. And you have explained to me that that charact Œ that what you described about being in Germany , and hearing of Œ about people who would have been capable of this kind of murder, sounds Œ A: Well, no, I di Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 256 Q: Yeah. A: Œ I Œ I assumed that. Q: You assumed that. A: I did not hear abou t it. Q: Yes. I understand now. A: I assume it. Q: I assume. But it™s also not really about the DPs, it™s about Œ about people who Œ about young Lithuanians who had been in the German army. And then Œ A: But people Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ any coun try, in Œ in Œ in general, that there are Œ there is a sick segment that is criminal. Q: Do you think amongst the Œ yes. Do you think that amongst the DPs, you heard any such sentiments? You know, when they came from Lithuania ? A: Sentiments? Q: Sentiments about Œ that had been very popular in Lithuania for a time, for Œ that Jews are responsible for our misfortune, the Jews helped the Soviets. You know, this sort of Œ A: Only Œ the only thing that I heard was again not in the camps, but when in Lithuania , you know, those who that some of them were accusing Jews for th Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 257 working with the Œ bringing Œ helping Œ bringing in Œ into Lithuania as communism, the Soviets. Q: Okay. Okay. A: No, because the Œ the farmers, they were much working with the Jews. The Œ the Œ the all Œ in Bir, in Papilys , we depended on them. And I know from our neighbor, from my mother, fro Œ they were very you know, like part of the family. It was not so Œ and that kind of the communist rumor, I did not hear from my farmers, actually, I heard that when I went beg Œ in the fall, when I went to the Œ to th Œ already back to the studies, in . Q: Yeah. I think that Œ A: And farmers were very open in Œ in the Œ at least northern Lithuania to the Œ and there were Jews in every smaller town. And that™s why, you know, when Œ when all 5,000 people in , and then I hear from Michael that there were 2,200. Q: Four hundred. A: How could it be? Not half of the city I haven™t seen hundred. But in the Œ they we re brought from those other little town, that are smaller, like Œ like Papilys , and Œ and they were, you know, sometimes maybe it™s three families. But sometimes, in some of those small Œ smaller towns, maybe there were 100. Because how else can you make up 2,200? Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 258 Q: Two thousand four hundred. A: Or four hundred. Q: Four hundred. I think that Œ A: That when farmers, I think, there was a working Œ s-some of them, of course, were not happy that some maybe Œ I mean, there are all kinds of business sharks in ev ery r Œ in every race, in every group. So some Œ there were Jews, like Œ like others, who wanted maybe to make some profit, more profit than they should. But in general, that was not in the air. It was a and that in Œ I would say Lithi-Lit huania in general, now that™s why we had an Œ this renaissance of the Jewish cult Œ culture, literature, arts, in Œ in Œ in Vilnius , in Œ in Lithuania , and a century earlier Œ earlier. Q: Okay, let™s proceed back to Germany , back to the DP camps, and where you are about to leave for the united Œ A: E-Even in the camps, I was not so involved with was going the camp. We were, three or four or five of us, interested only in literature, in the arts, we were publishing, working in that area. And the rest, again, did not exist to us, because we almost hated the rest of the camp, because to us they were just interested in to go somewhere, and be Œ make money, and become successful, and Œ a-and they were boring to Œ all of them. We kept ourselves apart. So, I™m not authority even to Œ I™m sure not even talk about it, the rest. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 259 Q: Okay. Okay, okay.

A: And we look at Manhattan , from that big window, at the pier 23, and myself and Adolfas, I remember very clearly, we said, almost at the same time, and we said, here we are, in New York . It would be stupid to go to Chic ago, when you are in Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 261 New York . We never went to Chicago . So, can we stay a day or two with you? And said, I will put you up for two or three days, until we find a job. Q: And what was your first job? A: In some Œ very similar to Neunert , what I did at Neunert .

Or story, I don™t remember which it was. A: Because we read in ﬁ New York Times ,ﬂ we bought and Œ and we saw the announcement. I said, we have to see. Q: Well, our interview, of course, doesn™t cover this part of your life, which is the major part. A: Yeah, that™s okay, that™s Œ that Œ Q: But, there is one final episode that I™d like to touch upon, and that you already foreshadowed when you said that you wrote for ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino ,ﬂ and therefore, became in some ways, not popular in the Lithuanian emigre community. But, it reestablishes a tie to what then is Soviet Lithuania . A: Yes. Q: Either in your book, or you mentioned it, is that after the Soviets returned, your mother told Œ at some point Œ Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 263 A: Yeah, when I visited in 1971. Q: Seventy-one. She said that you Œ they had been looking for you for a year. A: Yeah, yeah. Q: Why? A: Because I th Œ first because I was not there, that means I may be in the woods, joined partisans; myself, Adolfas, were not there, where are they? Q: Yeah. You™re of the age, you™re of the age, yeah. A: You ask Œ you ask Œ yes. You ask a mother Œ a mother doesn™t know. I don™t know where they are. Q: So explain for the camera what that means Œ A: Yeah, and then Œ and Œ Q: Excuse me. Explain for the camera what that means, to be in the woods, at that time. A: In the woods may Œ means that you joined anti-Soviet Œ Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisans. Q: Okay. A: So, they figured that I may have joined the partisans, but there may be other Œ another reason, because I had also somewhere in Œ in the maybe fall or winter of Œ of ™41, you know, published in the , a stupid Œ a stupid little, you know, Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 264 poems, sort of banal. But it was antiStalin , anti-Soviet. AntiSta Œ the anthi Œ and the Œ ﬁStalin ™s Anthem,ﬂ I think I called it. Q: Okay. A: And it was, you know, ah Œ very openly against Stalin . Q: Okay. A: So, I don™t think they liked that. Q: Okay. Did you ev Œ well, when you went back in 1971, that also suggests of having some special treatment on the part of the Soviets Œ A: Yes, as an Œ as an editor Œ ﬁ Film C ulture ﬂ magazine Œ I have to tell you that, right now, when I™m talking to you, I should be in Berlin. Q: Ooh. A: Where th Œ a huge conference is be Œ opening tomorrow Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ on ﬁFilm Culture ﬂ magazine. International conference about the importance of the magazine. So the magazine, very fast, because it was the only serious magazine in United States, became very important of Œ for the Œ for the United States , and Œ and the world. It was international. Q: And this is a magazine you founded. A: A magazine that I started in December, 1954. Q: Okay. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 265 A: So it became very fast, the leading world publication. I mean, this conference is just a reminder, and that what Œ what Œ and that magazine had contri Œ contributed to the Œ to the American film community, and the world. So, in Moscow , of course, they wanted to know Œ to have contact with anybody li Œ ist Œ ist Œ ﬁ Iskusstvo Kino ,ﬂ had to go to ﬁ Film Culture .ﬂ Q: And therefore, to you. A: Came to me, and they kept inviting Œ inviting me to film festival, because they want Œ need coverage. So one time I decided to go, and that™s, of course, another story. In 1971, that™s when I went. Because I already, by that time, I was cle-clever enough, and learned enough of a Œ how the world works, that I thought I can use this maybe, to visit my mother. Q: And could you? A: And I did. But that™s a long story. Q: Okay. A: That™s another story. But you can read it, because it™s very funny. Q: Okay. A: I will give you this book. You should read it. Q: Okay. Oh, thank you. ﬁ A Dance with Fred Astaire .ﬂ I will, thank you. A: And you will read my story, how I visit Œ managed to visit my mother. Q: Then, I have one last question. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 266 A: But that™s a Œ that™s another chapter. Q: Yes. It™s another chapter. Do you ha Œ did you ever discover if you had a KGB file? A: How could I discover it? Q: A-After independence Œ A: But I bet there was. Q: But you™ve never seen one? A: No, no. Q: Okay. A: How could I see? Q: Today one could. Today one could ask for one™s file from the Œ A: Ask whom? Q: The Lithuanian Special Archives, in Vilnius , and a search could be made to see if there is one. It could be done. A: I Œ I bet, I bet. Q: Okay. But th Œ my question is, did you know of one, and had you seen it? A: No, no. Q: You had not. Okay. A: No, no. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 267 Q: Well, I think we™ve come to the end, and I thank you for your time, for your generosity Œ A: W elcome . Q: Œ of the time. A: If, as you work on this, sort of Œ if you feel that on some aspect, you need some additional Œ additional elucida Œ elucidation Œ Q: Okay. A: I will Œ I will give you all the time that you need. Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. And I will say that this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jonas Mekas Œ Jonas Mekas , on July 1 st, 2018, in Clinton Hill , Brooklyn , New York . Thank you. A: And I thank you, because nobody asks me about th-th-th Œ that period of my life. And Œ and as time goes, you know, I begin to forget some as Œ so this forced me Œ forces me Œ even Michael , that™s why I™m grateful to Michael Œ he Œ he asked some questions that Œ that forced me to think, try to figure out, to tr Œ not have Œ as much as one still can. And because I™m preparing slo-slowly also, I™m collecting these materials, I will sort of have my own book. Q: Okay. A: About that period. Q: Thank you. Thank you again. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 268 A: So it™s Œ nothing is lost. That™s why it™s Œ there is always a reason behind it, and it™s Œ nothing is just Œ there is nothing really negative, and nothing really po Œ it™s all part of Œ depends what you do with it, how you look at it, and if you do everything right in your life, you are not afraid of anything. You just t-take it all as you are Œ you™re somewhere else. You look at it, oh. And I consider that Œ I remember what our friend, , he has a son, Aza. Says, o h, Aza , you know, I mentioned to you before, he must feel very guilty. I says, guilty, I don™t feel guilty, because all the bad that I have done in my life, I know those frogs that Œ Q: I know, I know. Well, let™s get Œ A: and also crows Q: Nest. A: [speaks Lithuanian Q: Okay. I™m going to just summarize that, as that you™re talking now, at the end, of what you do feel about, if you feel guilty about anything, it is of having killed frogs, and Œ A: To catch crayfish. Q: Fish, right. A: cray fish. I call them lobsters, because crayfish, supposedly, are much smaller variety of lobster, but our Œ in my river, the lobsters Œ those crayfish, you could not make any difference between what you call lobster, and crayfish. Interview with Jonas Mekas July 1, 2018 269 Q: They were that big. A: Yes. Q: Okay. So I™m going to go back to the Œ the original sentiment, where you say that if you feel guilty about something, it is for having killed the frogs, to be able to catch the crayfish, and for having taken the eggs out of crow™s nests and thrown them away. A: To protect the gard Œ Q: And to protect the garden. A: Œ the vegetables, and Œ Q: Right. A: Œ the Œ and the fields. Q: From the crows, and their children. A: Yes. Q: Okay. Thank you very much.
