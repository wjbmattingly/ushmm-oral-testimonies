William and Belle Zeck September 23, 1996 Tape One 01:01:14 Question: I would like you to begin by asking both of you to st ate your date of birth, where were you born -- and we™ll start with you, Belle. BZ: Answer: My name is Belle Mayer Zeck. I was born in Port Henry, New York, on Lake Champlain. When I was about si x years old, my family moved to Suffern, New York, here in Rockland County. So I went all through the public sc hools in Suffern, attend ed Syracuse University and graduated from Ford ham Law school in 1940. Q: Bill? WZ: I am William Allen Zeck, born March 3rd, 1915. I grew up on 110th Street between Fifth and Lennox Avenue, at the north end of Central Park. I attended grammar school, Townsend-Harris Hall High School, New York Univ ersity in University Heights, and the New York University Law School, from which I graduated from in June of 1936, and I have been a lawyer all of these years since then. Q: I want you to talk a little b it about your family background a nd sort of values that you grew up with. And also perhaps te ll me a bit about why you decided to become a lawyer. BZ: Well, my parents were both immigrants Œ both came to this country, my father slightly before the turn of the century, my mother at the turn of the century. They were married here and my father was an upstate dairy farmer, but my parents had four children and one couldn't make a living. For four children doing dairy farming, if you know anything about 2 the upstate New York or Vermon t dairy farmers, they are very poor people. And so he came to Suffern and went into busi ness, but always had a farm. I was the youngest, my eldest sibling was a lawyer and perhaps that unconscio usly had some influence on my going to law school. I was also a child of the Depression and it was quite clear, it was made quite clear to all of us that we had to earn a living when we got out of sch ool. It was all right to go to college, but it had to be a purposive venture. And I was told that I couldn't be an actress. I was also told I had no talent whatsoever as a teacher, so I kind of backed into the law, seemed to be all th at was left for me. 01:05:21 Q: Isn't that sort of unus ual though, for a woman of th at time to go into law? BZ: It was, it was. There weren't many women who went into la w at that time, it was still a man's field, I suppose it still is today. But actually, I came along just at the right time because two years after I graduated we were at war and all of the men, all of the lawyers, were being drafted. I think they were the first ones being drafted, so that not only was I welc ome in Washington, I and other women lawyers, what few there were, we were rather sought-after. Of course after the war was over and we returned to our private lives, everyt hing went back to the ol d, to the old order and women were not sought-after and women could not get jobs for whic h their training and experience had equipped them very well duri ng those years of World War Two. Q: Any particular challenges that you underwen t in terms of law and law school in those early years? 3 01:07:00 BZ: In my early years I can' t remember any other than mo ney, and I certainly was not impoverished in the sense that I was helped a great deal with scholarship money towards tuition. And there were always people around me to see that I didn't starve. But things were very tight for everybody. Q: Anything in particular you want to add abou t your family or your values, the way you were raised, that might have prepared you a little bit for the rather challenging work ahead of you? BZ: No, except that the work et hic was very strong in our house. I mean we always had chores, far more onerous than ou r children or our grandchildren. And aside from the work ethic, I can't think of much. The first thing I hear d about Germany, as I recall, was in high school. My father used to read the papers and he had family in Hungary. It was then Œ it had become Czechoslovakia during World War One, but he had fa mily and he was deeply concerned, as were most of the people we knew, deeply concerned about Hitl er. My mother had no family in Europe so that it didn't hit her quite as deeply as it hit my father, but she too was very concerned about wh at was happening to the Jews in Europe. I can't say it was a daily topic of conversation. It was not until I got to Washington that I became very immersed in Germany and in the war. 01:09:37 Q: Let™s just, I guess, ask Bill similar questionsŠ WZ: My parents also emigrated, they from Russia in the year 1900. Not togeth er Œ they met over here. My father got to live the United States, as he put it, just in time to understand that President 4 William McKinley was assassinated shortly after he got here . My father was in the coffee and tea business. He used to import green coffee, blend it, roast it, package it, sell it both at wholesale and retail. The same also with tea. Not roasting or Œ but he would bl end tea and sell tea, largely to retail customers. Our coffee roaster, at 110th Street, between Park and Madison Avenue, constantly spewed forth, every 20 minutes, a blast of wonderfully smellin g coffee, which disp ersed in the air, and it was the best advertising he could possibly do. It would spre ad over a period of about five blocks. We children were myself and two sisters. Be lle talked about the discipline of hard work and that was very much our discipline. If I had to specify an objective of my parents, both of them felt that their three children, regard less of gender, should receive as much education as they could absorb. So that Œ I told you abou t my college degrees; my older si ster was a graduate of NYU at Washington Square. My you ngest sister graduated from Hunter College and also got a Master™s Degree in addition to her Bachelor™s Degree. As far as the family beliefs are concerned, which I certainly think was impounded into me, and it was the business of honesty, integrity. My mother took care of all of the things she felt that she wanted in her children. My father wanted to be sure that all of the family bills were paid, regularly paid, paid on time. I think things that kept him awake at night, if at a ll, other than possibly health factors, was getting his bills paid. And this was a very important discipline and challenge because we too went through the Depression years. During those years I entered college at 19 in 1930 and graduated college and la w school in 1936 , but I worked regularly each day with my father in his business because he needed the hel p, so that this was the basic influence, I think, that probably has carried me through this eighth or ninth decade of my life, whichever it is. And the bu siness of honesty and straight talking and integrity is something that I have always looked for a nd felt and tried to practice, even in the business of politics, if you will. 5 01:14:20 Q: [Technical conversation: Let me Œ you kn ow what Bill? One thing I suggest Œ you're gripping your shirtsleeve here.] WZ: I'm sorry. Q: [Technical conversation: You're drivi ng him crazy because he thought it was his microphone. You can't do that, that would be very helpful.] WZ: Ok. Q: Perhaps you can tell me what you knew about what was happ ening in Europe. WZ: In Germany? Well, I did en ter college in 1930, and Hitler was beginning to scratch around and make his presence felt in one fashion or another in 1931 and '32. Hindenberg 1 was in charge at government, Hitler was pushing in that direction. I didn't know too much about the pre-1930 period, during Hitler's Munich and post-Munich, because it wasn't part of any of my studies, and I was very much involved both with the work I did at home and with my great desire to play shortstop for the New York Yankees and also be a member of the United States Davis Cup tennis team, yo u see. But once we got into the college level in our history courses and our political science courses, we knew what was happening in Germany, and it was neither pleasant nor pleasurable; but actually, we didn't regard it as a great threat until in the middle '30s we began to realize that the Hitler program was a definite threat to the Jews of Germany and when we began to realize also in the middle '30s his appetite for spreading pan-Germanism, we began to be very unhappy about what was happ ening in Germany. 01:17:02 1 Paul von Hindenburg (1847-1934), President of the Weimar Republic. 6 Belle, as she told yo u, had some family left in Hunga ry. As far as I knew, none of my father's family Œ he was the yo ungest child Œ came here in 1900, so we didn't have any family that I knew of in Europe and we didn't have that to concern us. My music was very important in our home. Under duress I studied the violin for six years. Both my sisters played the piano. My mother ha d a lovely singing voice and we did a good deal of singing and so forth. Music's been very important to us. My fa ther used to buy numbers of Œ he loved the Italian tenors, particularly Caruso, 2 and he loved some b eautiful tenors who were cantors. We had all kinds of music in the house during that period. Q: Actually, you bring up so mething that I guess I didn™t ask Belle about. Was religion important in your family? WZ: Religion? Yes, my parents were Conservative Jews. During my school years I would go to grammar school from nine until three. I would come home at three, I would have a snack and from four to five I would play the viol in, with my mother glar ing at me to see that I was giving her a full hour, except for five minutes she allowed me to go to the bathr oom. At six o'clock I went to Hebrew school, the Harlem Hebrew Institute at 111th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue, and I spent two hours there each day. So that this was a full day of education fo r kids of that era and education was the principally im portant thing in raising children of thos e years. I was Bar Mitzvahed at the usual age, and gradually after Ba r Mitzvah I worked my wa y out from under both the violin and Hebrew instruction. I was finished with all of that. But we had in those terms with a pretty full Hebrew education. As a matter of fact, I can probably sit here and write Yiddish while you speak English, writing Yiddish and translating as we go along. But I'm sure the scratching of the pen would bother the gentleman out there. 2 Enrique Caruso (1873-1921), Italian tenor. 7 01:19:52 Q: So you Œ did the fact th at you knew Yiddish or some German help you later on? WZ: Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I had five years of French. French was the language we all studied then, but I had a year of German in college and between the German and the English, I managed to get along in Nuremberg. Not if I was interrogating a w itness, not without the presence of an interpreter, a translator, but I do un derstand a good deal of the language, yeah. Q: And I'd like to pick up wi th what you were doing in Wash ington. You said that after law school you went to Washington? BZ: Well, two years after I graduated from law sc hool, I went to work in the General Counsel's Office of the United States Treasury and th e General Counsel, th en Randolf Poll(ph), assigned me to a fairly new bureau called Foreign Funds Co ntrol. It was in charge of administering the Trading With the Enemy act . And that act, of course, as you know, forbade all communications, tr ansmittals, remittances Œ any dealing wh atsoever Œ with Germany. Then, as Germany su ccessively occupied Austria, Poland, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries, and France, with each invasion the Tr ading With the Enemy act was extended to that country, so that by 1941, before I got to th e Treasury, all of Europe and Britain was fairly well Œ it was insulated to the extent that we could insulate them, to the extent that we could prevent Hitler from gettin g any use of Germany's external assets. Those external assets, I may tell you , were mainly held by I.G. Farben, the giant chemical company which had offices and factories all over the world Œ certainly in every major capital of the world Œ and I. G. was, they were consummate artists at camouflaging their 8 holdings. They had had a bad e xperience in the first World Wa r where several assets which they had in this country had be en vested by the Alien Propert y Custodian. So beginning as early as 1936, they made a Œ they began a concerted effort to transfer out any holdings which they had here into the names of nominees who would cl oak their assets for them. I was, in the course of my wo rk at Foreign Funds, I was assigned to th e investigation of German assets in this country, specifically General Analine and Film, which was, I think, their largest holding in this country. 01:25:03 But they had so many other par ticipations and holdings in so many companies, I won't recite them all. And then they, if they didn't own three nominees , through Americans, through Swiss, if they didn't own controlling or ma jority interest in companies, they had arrangements with Amer ican companies such as Standard Oil of New Jersey. And they formed new corporations with nominees for thei r half interests and with the other half being held by the American co mpany, mainly Standard Oil. I starte d to say that it was Œ that where they didn't have a direct or indirect particip ation Œ they had cartel arrangements with some of the leading companies in this country which permitt ed them the use of patents in Europe and, of course, in the first instance it was diff icult to prove, as I said, because of all these cloaking arrangements, pooling agreements, option agreements, and these sophisticated financial devices. It was difficult to prove ow nership. Once we did though Œ and this was slightly before the Alien Property Custodian's office was established in the Justice Department Œ once the Treasury felt it had a very strong case and once it had penetrated 9 these layers and layers of nomi nees and cloaks, then the property was vested initially in the Treasury and then the Alien Property Custodian would do the vest and foreign funds control, which would just continue to freeze assets wherever we could sh ow that they were beneficially controlled by the German s. [end of side 1, tape 1] 01:27:42 Q: [Technical conversa tion: Ok, I want to get her frame a little tighter please– Yeah that works good, you look great.] You were talkin g about collecting informa tion on I. G. Farben 's assets. How did yo u go about that? BZ: Well, Treasury had, to begin with, lists of kn own German concerns in this country, possibly not just from World War One, but from the ordinary sources, ordinary commercial sources and of course, it became more a matter not of identi fying the company, bu t of proving that it was German because by then they had been transferring shares. I mean, we knew the General Analine and Film had once been a Germ an company, but now these shares were in the hands of Swiss nominees and the management was American. 02:02:33 BZ: We sent investigators into these companies and examined th eir stock books, their transfer books, their books of ac count, and then we investigated the nominal share holders of the company. In the case of General Analine and Film, we foun d very useful memorandum when the army occupied German y and Bernstein's cartel in fina nce division went into the 10 Farben administration building and brought ba ck to Washington docu ments that I will tell you about in a moment. We foun d a memorandum from von Knieriem 3, the general council of I. G., to the me mbers of the Vorstand4 Œ that is, the managing board of directors of the company Œ outlining specifically , precisely what they were going to do to cloak their American holdings in the United States. And as I said before they used very diverse means, very intricate fiscal stratage ms and combinations of stratagems. But we had teams of investigators Œ this is before we learned so much from the investigators Œ on the ground in Germany. We had teams of investigators at the Treasury who were out in the field investigating in the banks, investigating banking transactions invo lving the Germans and companies and factories all over. 02:04:58 Q: And you persona lly were doing what? BZ: I personally supervised the investigation of I.G. Farben's largest firm in this country, General Analine and Film, and I wrote the investigative repo rt, with our conclusions. Q: [Technical conversation: Wh at is that? I'm hear ing feedback. I don't know whether it's affecting anything. Okay, that's probably a ll it was. I'm sorry.] BZ: Well, that's it. Q: Do you want to, just sort of continue on with your experiences? BZ: Then, well, take for example this investigative report. It would go from the General Counsel to others in the Treasury and they either would vest the company or they would ask the 3 August von Knieriem, member of Central Co mmittee of Farben™s Board of Directors. 4 Board of directors (German). 11 Justice Department, the Alien Property Custodia n to vest it. But mu ch Œ and then after about, towards the end of '42, the Justice Department started its own investigations. They had investigating teams in the field, too, becaus e, of course, they were preparing for trial and that required much finer tuning than our inve stigative reports represented. Then a former Assistant Secretary of the Treas ury, Bernard Bernstein, who was drafted in 1942, became Eisenhower's Œ General Eisenhower's financial aide in North Africa and in addition to his duties in North Africa, he tried to find out everybody in the North African theater who had Treasury experience or banking experience, be cause he was already paving the way for our occupation of Germany. He then sent us a telegram, well we didn't have telegrams, we had what we call TWXs, 5 where the Pentagon would summon you to a TWX conference and Bernstein would be on the othe r end of the Telex Œ it was more comparable to that. They called it TWX and he would ask me, in this part icular instance, he aske d me to send him the names of likely personnel for his operation, wh ich I did in conjunction with help from the Civil Affairs Division of th e War Department. These men, when we did occupy Germany, they went into mainly the Farben administra tion building in Frankfurt, that was in the American zone, and they just to ok every document that was visibl e or that they could find in any cabinet. They put them in gunnysacks, they brought them back to the United States to the Treasury, and on the basis of those Œ and then there was intensive work on the documents, because some related to war crimes, some didn't. Some rela ted Œ were of great concern to the Senate committee investigating wartime production and the conduct of our own businesses during the Hitler period, vis-à-vis their German counterparts. 5 Telegraphic message, interchangeable with Telex. Jennifer Mossman, ed., Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary (Detroit: Gale Research Inc., 1992), s.v. ﬁTWX.ﬂ 12 02:10:18 So that all of this did culminate in a way in the reports I discussed with you which represented the testimony of Co lonel Bernstein and Major Gene ral Hildering(ph), the head of Civil Affairs, before the Senate committees in December of 1944. And hundreds of these documents were annexed in a separate volume to the main report. The main report being a Part Seven of the Senate subcommittee hearings and the exhibits in Part 10. Q: Maybe you can tell me what the Senate h earings were, because I don't know how these worked. You don™t need to show me papers, I just want you to e xplain to me that involvement. BZ: They were investigating our mobilization for war, direct ed by Senator Harley Kilgore6 of West Virginia. As a matter of fact I think the hearings were calle d ﬁMobilization for War.ﬂ They were also invest igating the extent to which American industry helped, contributed to Hitler's war machine, before and during the war. The Treasury also, of nece ssity, had to do investigations in South America because it was through Sout h America, through Buenos Aires, largely, and Ecuador and, well, I said Ar gentina and Rio, that a lot of trans-shipments were made. Goods which originated in the Un ited States were sent to South America, ostensibly to non-German firms, which in turn sold them to German subsidiaries in South America and they were trans-shipped back to the continent. Does that give you an idea? 02:13:14 Q: So you were helping the Se nate committee to learn more ab out the German industry and its operations? 6 Harley Martin Kilgore (1893-1956). 13 BZ: That's right, that's right. And also helping th e division of cartels and the finance division of military government in Germany. Q: It's my understanding that, at this time, under the direction of Ei senhower, there was a big effort underway to try to get a handle on companies, like I. G. Farben so thatŠ BZ: Yes. Q: The process of warŠ BZ: Yes, in the early stages of the occupation, there was a concer ted effort at decartelization, which was breaking up these hu ge, these mammoth industries wh ich had really had its roots in every country of Europe, and to a certain ex tent they were successful. After Nuremberg, maybe Bill will talk later about the Clemency Commission, but Krupp 7 was not only put back together again, but they were given all th eir assets back. Farben was, I. G. Farben was broken up. WZ: There was a special deca rtelization branch in OMGUS, 8 in the Office of Military Government in Berlin, and they did a great deal of investig ative work and I think a great deal of work under General Clay 9 to break up the German cartels. I did some work, tangentially of what Belle's de scribing, in Washington with the Board of Economic Warfare. I was in the General Counsel's office there for several mont hs before I went into the army. And some of the work I did rela ted to Lend Lease, I was a me mber of our interdepartmental land lease committee. And one of the things Belle just mentioned, relating to the trans-shipment of American goods into South America, we were send ing, under land lease, goods 7 Krupp, after industrialist Gustav Krupp and his son and heir Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907-1967). 8 Office of Military Government, United States 9 General Lucius D. Clay 14 to England. And England was tr ans-shipping some of our land lease goods Œ intended for them and for the war effo rt Œ trans-shipping them to South America to protect their markets. 02:16:32 And quietly a fuss was raised about it by us, and I'm sure the land lease department and finally the foreign officer Œ wh at was his name, Belle Œ issued a white paper out of London, discontinuing the practice and explaining that practice. I did some related work at BEW10 as well, in connection with the se izure of patents. I was assigne d the business of writing an executive order for President Roosevelt, dire cting the seizure of enemy owned patents, pursuant to the Trading With th e Enemy act, which you mentione d. Also there, I worked on establishing the curriculum for the school for military government. Th is was in the early days of the war, but there woul d be a time when we were go ing to be the occupying power and so we established a school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, indicating the processes and the tactics and the legalities of the work that we would be performing as an occupying power. If, God-willing, we got to that point, you know. And also I knew, with not the great amount of detail that Belle did, about I. G. Farben , whose influence concerned not only the Treasury Department but the antitrust division of the Department of Justice Œ our agency as well. Because I think it was very plain that as the war was developing orŠ [interrupted by ringing telephone]. 02:19:07 10 Board of Economic Welfare 15 Q: Whenever you're re ady. OK, Bill, you were? BZ: Bill was talking ab out these cartels and I'd like to say a word about this. Cartels are not businesses, they're arrangements or agreements which divide up markets, fix prices, control production. The way this is done is through the use of patents. Now, Standard Oil of New Jersey is a good example. It had had long-standing alliances with I. G. Farben, which went back to World War One, and th ey not only had these cartel a rrangements but they had joint ownership of about 10 compan ies in this country other than General Analine and Film, which I mentioned. In the ‚20s, Standard Oil agreed to give I. G. Farben the patents and distribution rights for the production of synthetic gasoline. They were way ahead in terms of research, way ahead of I. G. Farben. In return, they were Œ and the right to the European market, where synthetic gasoline was badly neede d. In return, they were supposed to get not only the patents for the development of synthetic rubber, but they were supposed to get whatever know-how I. G. Farb en had in the production of synthetic rubber. All of our rubber came from Malaysia, 90 percent of it, and when the Japs attacked, the Japanese attacked us at Pearl Harbor, we found our rubb er markets cut off completely. In the meantime Œ and the perniciousne ss of these cartels becomes apparent when you realize that from, oh, the middle '20s, to as late as 1938, Standard Oil kept pressing Farben to give them those patents and to give them what know-how they had, because whenever our own rubber companies, Goodyear and Firestone for example, tried to do research in producing synthetic rubber, Standard Oil would say to them, ﬁOh, now, don't spen d the money. We have this in the bag, we're going to get them; it's just that they're having a little trouble with Hitler.ﬂ Well, we never did get them, bu t in the meantime in 1936, wh en all these preparations for 16 war were being made by I. G. Farben in conjunction with the German Wehrmacht, 11 the Farben people filed thousands of applications for patents with the United States Patent Office on their own. And of course they were accepted. Every single combination of elements known, they woul d file a patent on just to be sure that no one else could touch any one of the fields in which they wanted to be pre-eminent. So we had critical shortages, we had shortages in tungsten and in carbides and in nitrates and ironically, completely aside from the synthetic rubber deal, a lot of this cr itical war material was being shipped to South America for eventual transmittal to Germany. I. G. Farben, I rea lly don't like the fact that we always identify it as a chem icals concern. Everybody knows of its size, but I don't think people know how far afie ld Farben was from say, pharmace uticals. For example, all during the '30s, Farben produced 90 % of the gun powder, and certa inly during the war they produced 95% of the explosives that were used by th e German army. 02:24:45 There isn't a single bomb that could have been launched without the I. G. Farben explosives. They made the treads for the tank s, they were in synthetics; th ere wasn't, I can't think really of a piece of equipment, of armament to whic h Farben had not contributed a vital part. So that Hitler could not have possibly waged wa r without them because all Germany had was coal and I. G. Farben's chemists, who Joe DuBois 12 who was the head of the Farben trial team, called the devil's chemist, 13 which they could no t translate. They could take the coal and mix it with water and air an d make all of these synthetics. So that Œ and what they could 11 Armed Forces (German). 12 Josiah DuBois, Jr., Deputy Chief Counsel for the United States. 13 The interviewee is referring to DuBois™s book The Devil™s Chemists. 17 not make, because they were Germany's largest source of foreign exchange and hard currencies, namely dollars and Swiss francs, they got from thei r far flung enterprises. They knew what, the I. G. Farben people knew what Hitler was all about. They were responsible for his rise to power. They attended a meeting in, at the invitation of Goering14 and Krauch, 15 one of the defendants. 02:27:07 They attended a meeting at Goeri ng's house in February of 193 3, early 1933. That is a very significant meeting; Flick 16 and Krupp were there too. It's a significant meeting because just before that, just a few months before, the Nazis had been badly beaten in the elections. Then came this meeting and Hitler spoke at great length, I have the translation here; it's not a very good translation either, but Hitler spoke for well over an hour, two hours and in it he outlined very clearly his plans for German y. He said that Ge rmany's destiny was inextricably intertwined with that of a stro ng man. He went further, he said that it was only through military conquest that Germany had ever been great, led by a strong man. He talked a little about Œ for Hitler half an hour was little Œ he talked about the threat of communism, and of course that was the bi g bogie man for German industry as it has been for industry everywhere. And he magnified th e communist threat enormously . In fact later, when the Nazis burned down the Reichstag, 17 they blamed it on some poor homeless man who they claimed he set the fire. He wa s a mentally incompetent, but they claimed it was a communist 14 Hermann Goering (1893-1946); Commander-inChief of Luftwaffe, President of Reichstag, Hitler™s designated successor. 15 Carl Krauch (1887-1968), Nazi Military Economy Leader and professor of chemistry. 16 Friedrich Flick (1883-1972), industrialist and Nazi supporter. 17 Parliament (German). 18 plot to burn down the Reichstag, all of which history proved to be incorrect. However, back to the meeting. The Œ I. G. Fa rben ended up making the larg est contribution of the night Œ 400,000 Deutschmarks, which, let' say at the rate of four to one would be over a million and a half dollars back in 1933, was a stunning contribution. Howe ver, one of our judges said, ﬁWell, we have fund raising for our people, too. There's nothing wrong with politicians and fund raising.ﬂ However, after that meeting, Farben director s approached Hitler to find out what his attitude was towards their experiments with synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber and when Hitler said that it was indispensable to his future plans and gave them the go ahead, they then, the Fa rben directors, persuaded von Hinden burg to resign and made Hitler Chancellor of Germany. Q: Tape change. 02:30:50 End of Tape One 19 Tape Two 03:00:32 BZ: I™d like to go back to what I was talking about. Q: [Referring to interviewee™s eyeglasses ] So, let™s see you put themŠtake them off? BZ: I'd like to go back there. I was talking about what Farben had done in the way of stockpiling for Hitler and critical war material, about thei r supplying him with fo reign exchange to buy that which he didn't have or couldn't produce in Germany, but all and also to show its worldwide influence, but it still didn't impress one of our judg es who was reported to have said that he couldn't see the difference betwee n I. G. Farben and our own Dupont. Well, we were notŠincidentally, I could have told hi m the difference betwee n I. G. Farben and Dupont. I could have told him the differenc e between German indu stry and American industry because German industry was his enthus iastic partner for a decade before he ever started his wars, whereas in th e United States, even after Pear l Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt had to bribe our businesses to convert to war production by way of tax breaks and tax incentives. To get back, we felt that we had to show the size of I. G. Farben and demonstrate its worldwide influence for the purpose of indi cating what a necessary partner they were to the entire Nazi enterprise, and I would just like to quote a fe w, two short sentences from Telford Taylor, 18 who was our chief counsel of the subsequent proceedings. From the opening of the Flick case Œ Flick was the coal baron Œ he said, ﬁA t the threshold of this case and because of its unusua l character, it is vital that these principles be clearly understood. 18 Telford Taylor (1908-), American Chief of Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg. 20 The defendants were powerful and we althy men of history Œ of industry 19 Œ (pardon me), but that is not their crime. We do not seek here to reform the economic structure of the world or to raise the standard of living. We seek rather, to conf irm and revitalize the ordinary standards of human be havior embodied in the law of nations.ﬂ So I think if you have any more questions, this wa s I. G. Farben preparing for war. Then ther e came a point when I. G. Farben decided to build its fourth synthetic rubber plant at Auschwitz. They did it because of the availability of cheap labor in the form of concentratio n camp inmates. It is estimated that in the construction of this enormous plant, in the construction alone, 25,000 workers died. These workers were very, very badly treated and the pl ant was run with the help of the SS. In other words, there were SS guards in every part of the factory. Not only that, but the SS brou ght the concentration camp inmates from Auschwitz to the factory every day and I. G. Farben gave them receipts. They paid them , they paid the SS a dollar per man, a dollar a day, 75 cents for a woman and 50 cen ts for a healthy child, the child that could work. Then the SS complained that it wa s too dangerous to move these people over such a long road, that there wa s a danger that they could es cape, no matter how many guards they put on. So Farben, in conjunction with the SS, recommended that Birkenau be built. It was closer to Auschwitz proper and they built the crematorium, the gas chambers and the crematorium right into the building so that after the inmates, and there were French and Belgian and Gypsies there, so that after they were gassed, their bodies could be disposed of immediately in the ovens. That 's why Birkenau has always be en referred to as the four 19 It should be clear that the interviewee corrected herself and meant to quote the word ﬁindustryﬂ and not ﬁhistory.ﬂ 21 chimneys or five chim neys of Auschwitz. In fact it wa s the title of the book by Olga Lengyel. 20 03:07:37 But to get back to the slave labor operation, the longest sentence meted out on the slave labor count was seven years and another defend ant got four years and two other defendants got two years, which was the one part of the decision that I coul d not rationalize in any way, shape, or form. It was just a very arbitrary thin g and then of course, all of the sentences were commuted by McCloy™s Clemency Commission, which Bill may want to talk about later. Q: Now let™s go back a little bit now, because you™re now talking about sentences and I don't even know how you got there. BZ: I'm sorry. Q: That's okay. I know that pr ior to your going to Nuremberg you also, you went to London, is that right? BZ: Yes, yes, in 1944, 1945, I went to London as US Treasu ry representative in London and my assignment was to work on the legislation which the occupying forces would enact in Germany, if and when they established an occupation governme nt in Germany. And I ha d worked on that to some extent in interdepartmenta l committees in Washington and then it became an intergovernment thing in London. Q: Can you tell me anything? BZ: At that time, the commission, which had been set up by the Œ well, the London agreement was being promulgated, in which the Allied powers dedicated themselves to the punishment 20 The book mentioned by the interviewee is called Five Chimneys. 22 of war criminals, and th ey were also drafting the charter, pursuant to which the trials were conducted. And I did not partic ipate in that but I was very aware of their proceedings and would from time to time report to the treas ury about it, in the diplomatic pouch. 03:09:54 Q: Is there anything else you want to say about the legislation that you were involved in, in terms of the occupation? BZ: Well, we Œ of course the firs t thing that the office of military government did was abolish all the discriminatory legislation, the Nuremberg laws of 1936 and various ot her German laws which declared various acts to be criminal , such as intermarriage, such as even ordinary social intercourse with Aryans was prohibited. And of course they were not allowed to practice, Jews and other undesirables, were not perm itted to practice their professions, their own busine sses and so forth, and we drafted legislation which would annul all this terrible legislation. Q: You know it must have been pretty heady stuff to have been involved in this. BZ: It was very heady fo r a 27 year old girl, yes. WZ: You were not 27 when you went to London in 1945. BZ: I was 26. Q: This was big stuff. What were you thinking? WZ: Sure, it was big stuff for a girl, too. There weren't many of those. BZ: It was very heady stuff. You felt that you were doing something of such vital importance that the well-being of the world, you know, was inte rwoven with your work. At some points I felt that I was carrying the entire war effort on my own shoulders, you know. 23 Q: It must have been stressful and interesting. BZ: Oh, very. Oh, very. 03:13:14 Q: And as a woman, as a young woman, were you welcom e? Were you treated differently? BZ: Well, by and large I was treated very well. The State De partment in Washington was always very supercilious. These hyphenated names, you know, who were very supercilious people, but I think that they were nasty to everybody, not just women and theyŠ WZ: Still are. BZ: And it was a matter of degree. I'm sure that women were on a lo wer totem pole than men, but there were certain men that came in for their disapp roval also. Now th e British, both in Washington and in Lo ndon, were also inclined to be very supercilious, and they would argue a word in a proclamation or an ordinance. They woul dŠsorry Œ they would ar gue it to death I mean, whether business should be called a concern or a corporation or an entity, and it would just go on for hours. Of course, I was y oung and very impatient and we woul d lock horns and they would make unpleasant remarks about my youth, my impatience, my gender, my origins. That was Œ I don't think it was exclusively because Œ I don't think it was exclusivel y a female-male thing. Like the State Department, I think th at the British were generally very supercilious. They didn't realize that they were bankrupt, you kno w, and that they shou ld treat people better. Q: You didn™t ever feel at a disadvantage or you didn™t have more difficulty as a result of being a young woman? 24 BZ: Well, I had difficulty getting a passport to go to London in the first place. But the Secretary of the Treasury, who was having his own battles with the State Department, really didn't know me at all, decided to make it a cause célèbre, the St ate Department couldn't tell him who to send to London, or anywhere else, and he prevailed. There weren't, in retrospect, there weren't difficulties. Those, what difficulties I had as a result of gender, religion, perhaps age, I had after the war; I had after the war when I tried to get a job at Chase Ba nk in their foreign exchan ge, foreign trade section and I couldn't even get an interview. Q: Let's go back and talk to Bill for a minute about how you came to all of this. After you were with the Lend-Lease Commissi on, what you were doing? WZ: After I finished my milita ry service, in January of 1946, I guess, I knew about the Nuremberg trials. I had been in uniform as an aide-de-camp to General Don E. Scott(ph) when the requisition came through for military people interested in going to Nuremberg. Because we were just before the end of the war, the General said to me, ﬁBill, if you want to go to Nuremberg, I will let you go now. I will report you.ﬂ And I said, ﬁGeneral, I want to go to Nuremberg, but I want to get out of th e uniform first,ﬂ because I'd been away from home for six years and so it took a few extra months. When I did get out as a civilian, the only job I was interested in getting was a job in Nuremberg. I went to the Pentagon, I met Telford Taylor, who was still a colonel there and beginning to recruit for subsequent proceedings, subsequent trials. And I was prompt ly hired and went over there in March of 1946. 03:19:15 25 Q: Why were you so eage r to go to Nuremberg? WZ: I was eager to go to Nure mberg because Œ and not only eager to go to Nuremberg, but eager to work on an I. G. Fa rben trial, because I'd had contact w ith it in my work at the Board of Economic Welfare before I got into the Arm y. I was Œ I think being Jewish certainly had something to do with my eagerness to go there and since I had really been out for well over somewhere between four and six years, I had no law practice to go back to and I was interested in going to federal government agai n, and this seemed the pl ace to do it and to do, be part of the prosecution. So I went over there and what I found there was a few quick observations I made. All of the pe ople working on the IMT case Œ and just to se t the time for it, this was the end of March of 1946 and the IMT trial ended in September of 1946. The people working on the prosecution staff were virtually all in uniform, either Army or Air Force or Navy. The people who worked subse quent proceedings were all, excuse me, former military people now in civilian mufti. And I went over with the first group of lawyers hired for subsequent proceedings and there were 12 of us on the ship which interestingly was called the General Taylor , but apparently it wasn't named after Telford Taylor. When I received a call to report to the port to get on the ship I was told that the ship is the USS General Taylor and I said, ﬁOh, my good ness, has he received a promotion,ﬂ you know, because he'd been Colonel Taylor, but obviously it was a different Taylor. In any event, we formed a very close kn it group on that victory ship. Th ere were also some women going over as stenographers. Ther e were a few former Germans who were going over as translators. We talked about the obvious things , things we'd been doin g in recent years and what we hoped to do when we got over there. When we did ge t over there, there wasn't very much for us to do because the IMT trial was on, everybod y working was concerned with it. 26 We didn't know whether there woul d be a second international trial of industrialists, but my interest, Telford's interest certainly was, in beginning to resear ch for one kind of a trial or another involving the I. G. Farben people. I did sit in for a number of days between April and June on the IMT case, became familiar with the identities of the de fendants, the people in the dock, also trying to get organized with respect to I. G. Farben. There were then only two of us who wanted to work the I. G. Farben case. One wa s a lawyer from Virginia named Jim Heath, 21 who'd been a railroad la wyer, whose father had be en the counsel to the Southern Railroad. And we knew , the thing we did know as ba ckground matter was Bell's report to the Kilgore Committee, which was Part seven of that series of documents, and we also had a Part 10 which detaile d in narrative form some of the exhibits that they used. And then we began looking for documen ts because we had reason to believe that there was an I. G. Farben document center in Frankfurt. There were German documents in Berlin. All of these were captured documents. And there was one, what was the name of that little town outside of Frankfurt, Belle? Down by, no, down by Hoechst? No, I'll think of it. In any event, went to all of those places, couldn't find significant I.G. docume nts. By the time June arrived, it seemed reasonably clear that we wouldn't have a second international trial, although Telford was no t sure of it and I'd exhausted all the possible sources of Kilgore documents. So we decided that I'd go to Wash ington to look for Kilg ore documents because the people on that investigating committee were Justice people, Treasury people, War Department people Œ a limited number. And he said, ﬁWhile you're there, while you're looking for those documents, pl ease open a document center in the Pentagon for the high command and general staff on m ilitary cases and also on SS cases.ﬂ And he said, ﬁwhen you 21 James E. Heath; Chief Counsel for the Farb en trial team during its initial stages of preparation. 27 get there, you can work with Mickey Marcus, Colonel David Marcus, w ho is the head of the War Crimes Branch of the War Department.ﬂ So I worked with Mickey, you know who Colonel Marcus was, he was the West Point graduate who went over to Israel and was shot because he didn't know the pa ssword or tell the password. He was a very colorful figure, both in Jewish lore and in military lore. 03:27:44 He was a lawyer who was buried up at West Point, who also af ter Telford, went back after his hiring the first 12, did the interviewing and the hiring fo r the remaining civilian lawyers who went over to Nuremberg. So in the months of July and Au gust we hired a staff, did the necessary work to collect all of those military and SS documents in the Pentagon, and then I went to my first love, which was to find th e I. G. Farben docume nts. So I took the introduction to Part seven and I spoke with every one of the Kilgore people. There were I think seven or eight of them I talked to, trying to avoid talk ing to Miss Belle Mayer, who wrote the report, you know. Oh, they didn't know where the documen ts were, but I damn well better talk to Belle Mayer. I was not very fond of lady lawyers at that particular point in my life, so I called over to the treasury shortl y, at the end of Augus t, and a lawyer named Bob Scott answered her telephon e and he said, ﬁYes, this is where she works, but she's in Colorado now on vacation. She'll be back after Labor Day.ﬂ So the Friday after Labor Day I called, she answered the phone, I went over ther e, and we met. And I told her my tale of woe and said, ﬁWhat can you tell me?ﬂ In despair I said, ﬁWha t can you tell me about the I. G. Farben documents, Miss Maye r?ﬂ So she pulled open 12 file drawers and she said, 28 ﬁThese are the I. G. Farben do cuments, at least th e Kilgore documents.ﬂ So I looked at this tall, blonde girl, had a lot of suntan from her vacati on and I said, with a new look in my eye I said, ﬁMiss Mayer, you are a wondrous lady. I'll send over here for these documents from the Pentagon.ﬂ [end of side 1, tape 2] 04:00:55 WZ: It's not confusing, it's just a matter of timing and we'll do, as far as I'm concerned, you call the shots here. I'll tell y ou what you want to hear. Q: No, no, no, but I justŠto te ll you the sorts of things that I'm interested in, I'll let you (indecipherable). Wait just a mi nute. Hold it a minute. Okay, B ill, maybe you'll continue on. WZ: Belle said to me in no uncertain terms, ﬁYou can't have these documents.ﬂ I said, ﬁWe need them. We need them de sperately for trial. How can we pr epare for trial?ﬂ And she said to me, ﬁI don't think you people would know how to use these docum ents,ﬂ you know, in connection with the business of how this youn g woman was treated over in government, you know. She was giving me back some of what she undoubtedly faced herself. Well, she worked it out that the Treasury Department would work overtime over the weekend and photostat the documents if I could assure her that the War Department would reimburse the Treasury Department for the extra cost and I assured her that we could. And I left Washington on Friday and I came back on Monday morning and there, sitting in four or five large gunnysacks, were the Xeroxed copies of the preciou s documents. So I telephoned her promptly Œ I had to get back to Nuremberg because th ey were about to issue the decision in the IMT case, I certainly wa nted to be present. 29 04:03:20 I called her and said, ﬁThank you for the documents Miss Mayer. Can I take you to dinner?ﬂ And her response was, ﬁThe bill for overtime is 47 dollars and you're committed to having the War Department send us a check?ﬂ I said , ﬁYes, the War Department will send you a check.ﬂ We had dinner and I went back wi th the gunnysacks on Wednesday, back to Nuremberg. Now it was very clear that we were going to have an I. G. Farben trial and it would be conducted by the Unite d States. No other powers in th is case; we were going alone on this case and we desperately needed people to staff the prosecution . So the first thing I tried to do was get Belle, and we were having these telecons 22 each week and Belle began to, I guess she began to think about coming over , although the first I realized was when she was asking me on the telecon how much we would pay her, what her classification would be, because she would have to transfer from the Treasury Department to the War Department and that kind of bu reaucratic nonsense, you know. She wanted a raise above her present salary and Jim Heath sa id, ﬁWell, let her have it,ﬂ and I said, ﬁHell no, she's not going to get paid any mo re than we're getting paid.ﬂ She came over, in an y event, she came over in early November, I think. And she promptly went after several of her colleagues in Treasury who she felt would be useful here and one of them was Jo siah DuBois, who came over and became the head of the whole trial team. And he put her to work drawing the indictment, which she did largely all by herself. At the same time, I ha d a special project set up in Frankfurt with a Paul De ncker, who was the chief bookke eper of I. G. Farben, and I was pumping him over a nu mber of days for info rmation about th e work activity of each of 22 Teleconferences. 30 these members of the Vorstand , so that we had curriculum vitae on all of them from Dencker. And I came back from there, Belle worked on the indictment, and shortly after that I realized that I would not probably be ab le to function with the new hierarchy of prosecutors on the I. G. Farb en case, because Joe DuBois had decided Œ he had seen a picture of an ugly SOB in an SS uniform, who somehow worked for I. G. Farben in some capacity, named von der Hyde 23 and he said, ﬁI've got to have this man in the dock,ﬂ and I said, ﬁThe man doesn't belong in our dock because of the caref ul selection we've made with respect to background.ﬂ Ever y member in the dock was a member of the Vorstand. 04:07:51 Q: [Technical conversation: I™ve go t to see what th is noise is–] WZ: I decided that with all the wo rk and effort I put in to this thing, with the care with which I'd selected the individual defendants, develo ped their backgrounds through quizzing and interrogating Dencker, and with the theory, the legal theory I had established with respect to the individual responsibility of each of th e Vorstand members. When Joe DuBois arrived from the United States of America Œ and I d on't know what, if any ba ckground he had on I. G.; Belle had a lot of backgrou nd. I didn't know what DuBois 's background was, but that didn't matter if all he could see himself doing, fresh off a plane, on the basis of a photograph he saw, was make an arbitrary decision to re place a vulnerable defendant with a guy in an SS uniform, I figured that I' d had enough, you know. Belle wa s there, there was a new team, another one arrived while I was busy interrogating in Frankfurt, in the coldest winter they'd 23 Erich von der Hyde, Member of Political Economy Department. 31 seen in a hundred years, a man came in off a plane na med Morris Amchen, and he looked around and he saw what I was doi ng, and he said have I examined their income tax returns? So I figured this was another on e who was going to bri ghten my life as I try to proceed with this prosecution. I decided to go home. Befo re I went home, I was asked to serve as the counsel to the court in the Ju stice case; the Justice case was a marvelous case. You saw the bones of it in the movie Justice at Nuremberg . They structured that, th e story, in terms of the Justice case and I was bein g pushed by a dear friend, Charlie LaFollette,24 who was the chief prosecutor in that case, to come with that court. Telford Taylor called me on the telephone and he said, ﬁBill, with all the work you've do ne, why don't you stay and help put the case into court?ﬂ And I said, ﬁTelford, I am going home, period .ﬂ So I went hom e, and I brooded all Œ for the rest of the year and finally decided to sit dow n and make my contribution to Nuremberg, in the form of that article in the North Carolina law Journal. But my Nuremberg work breaks off at this point, so that I think Be lle better carry it forward. Q: I just wanted to ask yo u a couple of questions before we talk to Belle again. WZ: Go ahead, sure. 03:11:46 Q: You had established, helped establish whic h defendants you were going to prosecute and you talked about individual responsibility. Was there some overriding principle that needed to apply in your mind when yo u chose these people? 24 Charles LaFollette (1890-1974); Representati ve from Indiana, Deputy Chief Counsel for War Crimes at Nuremberg in 1947. 32 WZ: Well, number one, you had to be able to indicate that these people were involved and importantly involved in making policy and in thei r functioning together wi th the Hitler people, together with Goering, who wa s in charge of the, not the four year plan, what was it? BZ: Yes, he was. WZ: In charge of the four year plan. You had to know what their activities were in the company and they were as varied in I. G. Farben as the 12 Œ the defendants in the 12 different cases Œ the 12 individual cases were. But all of these coagulated in our minds anyw ay in terms of their contribution to the war, you see. Now these Vorstand people we re, some were chemists, some were engineers, there's a couple of lawy ers, some were salespeople, whose activities were involved in foreign diplomacy. BZ: Spying. WZ: Spying for the Nazis, sure. But we had all of these things set up and as a lawyer, we had to do it that way. You couldn't just us e a broad brush and decide because a man was on the Vorstand, we'll put him in the dock. It wasn't that kind of thing, we ha d background, we ha d information, we had evidence on all of these people. 04:04:01 Q: Was it difficult to get that background? WZ: There were two ways in which we ac quired evidence. One was through paper, documentation, which was re ally the bulk of what we did in al l of the trials and the other was through interrogation. And the inte rrogation process proceeded excee dingly well, unlike trying to prosecute war criminals in Bosnia , because these people were our prisoners. We had won a war and 33 they really didn't have any alte rnative, so that when you interrogated them and you had some documentation when you did interrog ate, I think you could expect for them to tell you the truth, particularly since they all had one defense: Supe rior ordersŠwe had to do it because Hitler ordered it or we had to do it because the head of the company ordered it, you see. But you still didn™t make a case that requires individual knowledge and individual acquiescence and responsibility, without proving that the individual defendant did know what he was doing and did willingly collaborate with the Hitler government. Q: Is there any way to sum up your impressions of some of these people you interrogated? WZ: I think, of the people that I interrogated, ba sically my useful interrogation on I. G. Farben was with this bookkeeper Paul Dencker. And Dencker was a mousy little man with a mustache, who may have weighed about 147 pounds soaking wet. And he sat very submissively and referred to me as ﬁHerr Doktor,ﬂ 25 you know, and he answered my questions and I would question hi m about Krauch and about Schmitz 26 and about Schnitzler27 and about Heinrich Mann, 28 and all the other people in the dock, what did they do. And he knew what they all did, what thei r assignments were and so forth. He had a vast knowledge and I was fortunate to have Dencke r, and I think you people knew of Dencker because I first saw his name in one of your re ports, Belle. But then I went home and turned I. G. Farben, the prosecution, over to the tend er mercies of Belle Ma yer and Joe DuBois and I guess Drex Sprecher29 became involved in the case too. Q: Did you interview any, did you interrogate these other members of the Vorstand? 25 Doctor (German). 26 Hermann Schmitz, Chairman of I.G. Farben™s Board of Directors. 27 Georg von Schnitzler, Chairman of Farben™s Board of Directors. 28 Wilhelm Mann, Chairman of Fa rben™s Board of Directors. 29 Drexel A. Sprecher, Assistant Trial Counsel for the United States at Nuremberg. 34 WZ: I'm sure I did, some of them. At this par ticular moment I am hard pressed to remember which. I think you may gath er, at this point, with my departure, that there's a certain philosophical rejection of that part of the I. G. Farben prosecution that followed my departure. They were in good hands. 04:18:14 Q: Let me ask you one other question an d then you're off th e hook for a while. WZ: Right. Q: You initially went ov er to work on these cases during the time of the IMT, and you were an observer there. What was, can you describe for me what it was like to be in that courtroom? WZ: During most of the time that early summer and late spring, the trial was being conducted by a man who later became United St ates Senator Thomas J. Dodd. 30 He was a little white-haired man with a round belly, and he was the least likely American impression of a great trial lawyer, but he stuck it out you see, until many people, there were many who came there with reputations, who came to Nuremberg, stayed a week, who were well known back home, who were using this Nuremberg adventure, to which they contributed very little, for political purposes and to dress up their curriculum vitae(ph), you know. There were many of those. There were a number of very competen t young people, like my old colleague Tom Lambert of the BEW, wh o was a naval officer at the time and a number of others who made a contribution, worked hard and did make a contribution and then went home. Everybody wanted to get home. All the people in uniform wanted to get home. 30 Thomas Dodd (1907-1971); Senator from C onnecticut; Executive Trial Counsel, U.S. Counsel at Nuremberg. 35 Q: What was it like in that courtroom? What was the atmosphere like? WZ: The atmosphere in the co urtroom Œ number one in the do ck was Hermann Goering; in political terms, the head of the whole team. And he was le aning over the Œ like I'm leaning over the edge of this table, you know, appearing disintereste d. Generally, he had his own idea about where this was going and he knew wh at was going to happen. At the other end, at the far end from Goering was sitting Mr. Schacht, 31 Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht did not look ahead. Schacht sat with his back, if this was the dock, Staccato was sitting here and looking out in this direction. Across fr om where I'm sitting would be th e well of the c ourtroom, with the lawyers and parallel to this, on the other side, were the judges. The legal staffs were off at one end and you have the twenty two peop le in the dock and each had a particular different face and different approach. You ha d the disgusting pig of a man, who was the publisher of a dirty magazine, Der Stürmer, you know, Julius Streicher.32 You had the two military leaders, Jodl33 and Keitel 34 and they were wearing un iforms that hadn't been pressed that morning for sure. You had the two naval leaders, Raeder 35 and the guy whoŠ BZ: Jodl? WZ: No, no. Raeder and the one who succ eeded Hitler. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: It's okay, I'm just trying to get a sense ofŠ 04:22:59 31 Hjalmar Schact (1897-1970), President of the Reichsbank. 32 Julius Streicher (1882-1946), Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Der Stürmer. 33 Alfred Jodl (1890-1946); Chief of Operations Staff of the High Command of the German Armed forces, 1939-1945. 34 Wilhelm Keitel (1882-1946), Gene ral Field Marshall and Chie f of Staff of the German Armed Forces, 1938-1945. 35 Erich Raeder (1876-1960), Grand Admiral and Commander in Chief of German Navy. 36 WZ: I know hisŠ Q: [Technical conversation: The buzz in the room.] WZ: I know his name likeŠ BZ: Doenitz? 36 WZ: Pardon? BZ: Doenitz? WZ: Doenitz, that's right, Karl Doenitz. You had the Nazi philosopher Rosenberg, 37 you had the guy who looked like he was left with half a brain, Rudolf Hoess, 38 whose look never changed. He just sat there looking out like this. You had people like von Papen, 39 the diplomat, who was well-controlled, who also was acquitted. You had the butchers, Hans Frank, 40 who was the Gauleiter41 of Poland, who was a promin ent Catholic and who said, quote, ﬁIf Germany lives for 1000 ye ars, it will never be able to atone for what it's done to the Jews.ﬂ A few others, I would have to look , yeah. But that was it and it went along in very desultory fashion. Now I was not there when this happened, but one of the spectacular parts of the trial was when Goer ing testified, and when Goerin g testified, b ecause this was the piece de resistance, our chief prosecutor, who delivered most wonderful opening and closing addresses with magnificent prose, came in to cross-examine Goering. And he wasn't 36 Karl Doenitz (1891-1980), Commander in Chief of German Navy and Hitler™s designated successor. 37 Alfred Rosenberg (1893-1946), Hitler™s ment or and semi-official philosopher of Nazi party. 38 Rudolph Hoess (1900-1947); Commandant of Auschwitz, 1940-1943. 39 Franz von Papen (1879-1969), Reich Chancellor in 1932 and Hitler™s Deputy Chancellor. 40 Hans Frank (1900-1946), Nazi party jurist and Governor-General of Poland during World War II. 41 Term used for head of a Nazi administrative district (German). 37 well-prepared for the kind of stuff he was getting from Goering, and the press was reporting that very sharply and in abundance, so th at after a day or two of Justice Jackson, 42 the British were called in to put some semblance of usefulness in to this cross examination of Goering. And that was done by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, wh o had just become the Attorney General. That was it. There was a lot of Œ so there was a lot of sitting and time was passing during the Tom Dodd peri od and the trial was just Œ much of the stuff, the documentation part of it, didn't have any fi reworks, you see, because unde r the rules established, every document had to be translated into four langua ges and document books, with respect to each defendant, had to be delivered in advance to the defendant's counsel. And so it was a very slow and quite tedious process. But the reason really, the basis for the convictions was very much more the do cumentation than the interrogation of the witnes ses. The witnesses all said, superior orders, Hitler ordered it, we had to do it. But the Germans, this is generally known, were absolutely wonder ful document keepers, you kn ow. They loved nothing better than General Ohlendorf 43 reporting each day in the Einsat zgruppen document s in the village of wherever, ﬁWe shot 167 Jews, 72 Gypsies, a dozen or so Co mmunists,ﬂ and so forth. And these, even at the level of th e industrialists, in terms of th eir production, in terms of the conferences and the work they did for the Nazi government , were very well recorded. 04:27:59 Q: Was there a feeling of animus? Were the prosecutors able to comport themselves in a very formalŠ 42 Robert Jackson (1892-1954), United States Chief Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal. 43 Otto Ohlendorf (1908-1951), Head of Nazi Security Service. 38 WZ: Sure, the German prosecutors Œ or the Germ an defense counsel for example, were carefully selected from what was available th en in Germany and they did their job as best they could, within the limits of what the c ourt was receiving. The court was receiv ing their statements with respect to superior orders, you know, and the court treated with it accordingly. I don't Œ now I d on't think they were delivering spectacular justif ications of what happened in Nazi Germany. Many of the defendants, for example the, what's the name, youth lead er and the oneŠ BZ: von Shirach. 44 WZ: von Shirach and the one who died about two years agoŠ BZ: Speer. 45 WZ: Speer, Albert Speer. He said, ﬁWe really didn't know what wa s going on in the concentration camps,ﬂ you know. Th ey did plead lack of knowledge of what happened, what went on in the concentration camps. The most wonderfulŠ Q: I'm not sure I can let you fini sh this because we™re out of tape. 04:30:27 End of Tape Two 44 Baldur von Schirach (1907-1974), Reich youth leader and Governor of Vienna during WWII. 45 Albert Speer(1905-1981), Reich Minister for War Production from 1942 to 1945. 39 Tape Three 05:00:59 WZ: The lawyers, from day to da y, they showed no animus, bu t they, yes, they showed no animus. They were doing a job, but it's a job they wanted to do. And it was a job that in most cases was predicated upon their idealism with respect to, particularly in this case, achieving justice. That, yes. Q: [Inaudible]. Belle, your collea gue left At this point and you wereŠ BZ: Well, I want to say fi rst one thing in self defe nse. Bill made it sound as if my reluctance to go to Nuremberg was predicated on mercenary grounds and it was not. I did ask for a raise in salary, but that was very incidental to the pr oposition that Schacht and Funk 46 had been acquitted and I knew that it was going to be very hard to convince judges that these nice looking businessmen, these important businessmen, could be guilty of the heinous crimes that they committed. What did Funk have, a few, so me years? But anyway Œ and Speer got some years, but the economics peopleŠ WZ: Speer got 20 years. BZ: None of the economics pe ople were sentenced to death or anywhere near it, and it was because if these leaders of the economic life of the country had got such light sentences, then I couldn't see them going after these men who looked like businessmen, talked like businessmen, and were really murderers. I haven' t even got into poison gas, or gotten into medical experiments for which four of the Farben defendants were convicted and again given very light sentences. The medical expe riments which the United States Holocaust 46 Walther Funk (1890-1960); Minist er of Economic Affairs, 1937-1945. 40 Museum has so well documented, I won't go into them, but the Farben people sent quantities of serums to be tested on concentration camp inmates. They were injected with various typhus and typhoid serums, which were experimental. 05:04:02 They were subjected to atmospheric pressure experiments where the inmates not only died but they, their brains exploded; they died in incredible agony. And ou r court could give you an example of what, for want of a more elegant word, I will ca ll nit-picking Œ took the word Versuch, 47 V-e-r-s-u-c-h, and in its decision the court wrote, the prosecution claims, I'm paraphrasing, the prosecution claims that that means experiment. The defendants claim that it means test. In a criminal case, we must give the favor of th e doubt to the defendants. Now if anyone can tell me the difference between experiment and test, I'd be glad to hear it. Farben also manufactured the poison gas, the Zyklon B, and th e serum and the Sarin and the Tabun which were used to exterminate the co ncentration camp inmate s, knowing full well the purposes for which it was going to be used, because these were volatile gases and only I. G. Farben, only their technicians, could control the incidence of the gas, the volatility of it. Aside from that, though, I do think this Œ agai n going back to the pros ecution, that we came from very diverse walks of life and obviously ve ry different exposures. But by and large, all of the lawyers were, as Bill said, very idealistic, very knowledgeable about the atrocities committed by Hitler and other people in the Third Reich and determined to mete out justice. 05:07:10 47 Experiment, trial, or test (German). 41 Many of us felt as the Bri tish felt in London Œ that the crimes that these people had committed had been repeated so often and were of such co mmon knowledge that the courts should take res adjudicata48 of some of these events and act s that had been publicized on a worldwide basis. Take judicial notice of the fact that they were committed, without the necessity of these very labored proofs. And that 's where the trials bogged down, because as a result of the problems in the IMT, they'll also mention that the subsequent proceedings were conducted under the charter, that was th e substantive law, but because of the terrible problems of the translation and the reproduction of documents , the subsequent proceedings were conducted under Allied Control Counsel la w number 10, which said , in effect, that if an original document could not be produced, that a Photostat mi ght be used. That if it were impossible to authenticate a particular docume nt, if the authenticating party was dead or missing or couldn't be located , that proof of the source of that document would make it eligible for admission into evidence. In other words, the rules of evidence were ameliorated because of physical exigencies, while our, the Farben court, our judge s, went back to the basic rules of the evidence, Anglo-Saxon rules, would not permit in evidence any document that hadn't been authenticated and reauthenticated. In fact, if I may be personal, and we've been very personal here, this was the only continuing brawl I had with my colleagues at Nuremberg. The case of von Schnitzler is a good point, is a good example. The investigating group that had initially gone into Germany had taken several depositions of 48ﬁA matter adjudged; a thing or matter decide d by judgment. Rule that a final judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is c onclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies, and, as to them, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action.ﬂ Henry Campell Black, M.A. Black™s Law Dictionary (St. Paul: West Publishing Co., 1983) s.v. ﬁres adjudicata.ﬂ 42 von Schnitzler in which he bare d his breasts, so to speak, in which he said yes. They described he was the first person to describe the meeting of February 1933, in which I. G. Farben had cast its lot with Hitler. He was the first person to say, once we got the assurances that our plans for developing sy nthetic oil and synthetic rubber were very much to Hitler's liking, we then supported him in every possible way. And th ese depositions of his were pretty lengthy. Well, somebody on our trial staff said, ﬁOh, you can't introduce this document because of some technical flaw,ﬂ very minor and so Drex Sp recher went back and he again examined von Schnitzler after all these years, af ter von Schnitzler had been sitting in jail, talking to his former colleagues and undoubtedly taking a beating from them for the candor with which he had sp oken two years earlier. 05:11:51 And he said, he didn't exactly retract but he said that he didn't know what he was saying because he said Œ now I'm quoting, ﬁI was te rriblyﬂ (quote) ﬁdepressed at the time.ﬂ He recanted. Eventually Drex went back to him an d he finally said, ﬁWhat I initially told those people in Frankfurt in 1944 or '45, I forget which was the tr uth.ﬂ But I mean this constant revisiting of a document Œ don't forget that in the Farben case, ove r 2000 documents were introduced. That doesn't include the interrogations of the defe ndants and of other employees of I. G. Farben, who had writte n very damning memos to the board of directors. So I would like to comment on something else, because I don't think that young people today, even lawyers, can begin to visualize the mechanical difficulties un der which we were operating. We did not have modern Xe rox machines, copying machines; we had these old photo 43 copiers, which were a wet process and they ha d to, you had to use this thin copy paper which came out and curled at the edges. Now we were requir ed to give the defendants™ copies of all of our exhibits 24 hours in advance of their intr oduction. This called for a very strict timetable. In the mean time the mimeograph people Œ I didn't mean photocopying, I meant mimeographing. The mimeograph people we re working double shifts, but even so, they couldn't handle this volume of business. We never were able to get things from them on time. Instead of having our own duplicating machines, we had to rely on this pen. The mimeograph Œ pen is not the righ t word for it but Œ they were in isolation and somebody would hand them something, it could be a Rand McNally atlas with a hundred pages of charts. We also had to assist the defendants in locating things they considered material to their defense, which they did no t have the means to locate, so that half the time we were working for the defendants, assisting them. I felt these were the only brawls we had, that we were leaning backwards to show how fair we were being. Charles LaFollette, whom Bill mentioned, the former congressman from Indian a Œ Bill described his role in the case, the Justice case and against the ju dges, the people's court. 05:17:30 LaFollette said that, on ce said jestingly, but with great wear iness, that he had always thought that the aim of the trials was to punish the pr osecution and all that the trials were doing was killing, to punish the defendants. But all they were doing was killing the prosecution, and there was a lot of truth in that. In fact, we ha d, I think what the pros ecution was lacking, if I may be as frank as Bill, I think that what we were lacking was top-notch trial counsel. This 44 is in retrospect. I think if we had had some good homicide lawyers over ther e, we might have made a more telling case. As it was, we did have some trial lawyers who came with good reputations for advocacy, who left, because these were people, no matter how primitive our technical equipment, these were people who were used to pushing a button and summoning a staff who would immediately respond. Our typewriters were antiquated, making carbon copies, 25 of every single thing that was done, was just back-breaking. And so we had trial lawyers who just would not stay because they could not operate in this very frustrating milieu. Q: What else can you tell me about preparin g for the trials themselves Œ th e collection of evidence, who helped you in that endeavor? BZ: Well, we had analysts, translators, and we would tell them what we were looking for. I had done a draft of a trial memorand um but I'm wondering how many people on the trial team was following it very rigidly, because frequently we would send off an analyst, say to Berlin document center because we felt that certain points we were going to ma ke, needed some bol stering. And they would go to Berlin and these peopl e did work, but they wo uld decide what they wanted to prove and they would come back with documen ts which they considered really incriminatory, but they were not the documents you sent them for. There were analysts, there were st enographers, there were people to whom one gave docume nts already in one's possession and asked them to give you a digest of them. So this was the staff, there were lawyers, analysts, stenogra phers and then these kind of separate omnibus groups , like the mimeograph people. 05:20:54 45 WZ: We did use Germans. The Germans were ea ger to work because they would get a decent ration, you know, and they weren't in policy positions. They did mechanical work, you know. And they mounted mech anical work required, you can gather from Belle's description, of the movement of the document from a cave in which it was uncovered by the army and its intended use by an attorney after the document ha d been translated, and so on and so forth. And th en it had to be gotten into the ha nds of the defendan t. It was a very, very, very difficult operation. I must say this , I don't intend really to sound sour on the Nuremberg activity, regardless of how I felt and why I left when I did. Three things I think must be mentioned: Number one, the law we established, which provided that a head of the government could be prosecuted as a war crimin al, was brand new. Nob ody ever thought of trying the Kaiser49 or I don't want to speak about Na poleon because it escapes me at the moment, but that is now accepted international law. Number two, with re spect to superior orders, it has always been, in the American orde r of battle, that you ob eyed the order of the superior officer and if that superior were a corp oral or a sergeant or a captain or a general, his order was sacrosanct. As a result of Nuremberg, our order of battle was changed to provide you had to obey only the lawful order of a superi or officer. So now, even the private is invested with a policy gene. He has to obey what he's orde red to do, but not if he's ordered to kill babies and defe nseless people, as happened in the Lieutenant Calley case in– BZ: Vietnam. WZ: Vietnam. So those two things, and perhaps the most importan t thing Œ and I certainly did not go to Nuremberg for the purpose of creating a history. I went to Nuremberg with the purpose of establishing certain law with respect to initiating and waging aggressive war. And I don't feel that we were successful, ba sically, in that respect, but we established a 49 Emperor (German). 46 history and all the skinheads that can be collected on anywhere and all the naysayers have to face the history, the transcripts of the Nuremberg tria ls, the volumes Œ several different sets of volumes, the first one on th e IMT, a terrible volume, 42 of them, the blue back, and so forth. 05:25:36 But this kind of thing Œ and mine is not a document recita l Œ but those compilations, which largely Drex Sprecher wa s the head of editing and gathering, that's been Sprech™s career, really have been on file in European countries and in libraries and the Library of Congress, of course, and in law libraries all over the Unit ed States of America. And that is not policy stuff, that's historical fact. Fortunately most of it™s supplied by documents main tained by the Germans themselves. So that to me is the warming aspect of my recollection of Nuremberg. It was a terrible place in which to work and if when they di dn't pay attention to you, you formed a softball team and you played out where Hitler used to conduct his meetings in the, what was theŠ BZ: Sportpalast(ph). WZ: Sportpalast, yeah. And you sat around and you talked and you talked about many, many things, but you did an enormous amount of reading of documen ts and so forth. And Œ but the history of Nuremberg is so mething that pleases me very much. It was worth all the Œ there was a good deal of agony involved in doing that work over there, no question about it. So I'm glad I was associated with it. BZ: And it certainly is the answer to the revisionists. 47 Q: Let's just go back a little bit more to the I. G. Farben trial? BZ: Oh, is this going to go on much longer? 06:00:55 Q: I just want you to sort of wrap up this Œ what else ca n you tell me aboutŠ BZ: And incidentally, Randy, I' d like to say this, that the documents, which were unearthed by the troops in 1944, which were the subject of the Senate invest igation hearings, th ey were just a small part of the evidence, because after we go t to Nuremberg, many of the defendants who had never been interrogated were interrogated. We fo und caches of documents at various individual factories throughout Germany. After all, I. G. Farben had about 500 factories and owned innumerable related establishments. And so we sent investigator s into all of these establishments, looking for evidence to plug a lot of holes th at we had andŠ WZ: But you're talking I. G. Farben, aren't you? BZ: Right. And to supple ment what we already had. Q: Did you get support from other go vernments, from Jewish organizations? BZ: Well, none from Jewish orga nizations. I doubt that they had the kind of material that we had. The support we got was from survivors of the camps, who might have been directed to us by the Jewish organizations, but not as far as docume ntation was concerned, be cause they were not in Germany at the time, the Jewish organizations we re not. We did talk to many survivors, of Auschwitz in particular. Q: Did you personally? 48 BZ: No. In a non-assignment fash ion. I would talk to people in th e DP camps, but I was severely handicapped in that sense. I could not speak Yi ddish and no one could understand my German. I thought I was pretty good at German, but nobody could understa nd it. I have a terrible accent in everything. As a matter of fact th e only way I could talk to people in the DP camps and particularly to the children was in my baby Hungarian, because you'd always find a Hungarian Jew who could translate for you. And my discussions with them ra rely bordered on their experiences because the kind of evidence we could use had to be really in-depth kind of probe. 06:04:58 Q: Were you involved in the interr ogation of any of the defendants? BZ: Before the trial, yes. I was involved with this same vo n Schnitzler we've be en talking about and with Ilgner. 50 Now many of our defendants were very dignified people whose bearing and whose looks and whos e speech were not lost upon the court, believ e me. But then there were other defendants who were really rather loathsome, including one whom I interrogated, Max Ilgner, and he was the chie f salesman of the group and he had salesmen throughout the world, but his salesmen in South Am erica were called Verbingsdungsmänner 51 and they were, they became spies for the German governme nt. It's interesting to me that every place we went in Germany was full of documentation, but there were two special groups in Berlin which dealt directly with the Wehrmacht, (the German army), and exclusively with them. And one was called the Vermittlungsstelle 52, which was the headquarters of these salesmen. And they reported, the bureau in Berlin reporte d directly to the German high command. And 50 Max Ilgner, I.G. Farben Director. 51 Middleman, contact (German). 52 Agency (German). 49 they, it was that bureau whose records were all destroyed, before the United States and Allied advance in 1944. And there was another bureau which dealt directly with the army and with the intelligence people and that was called VOWI, 53 V-O-W-I, and their records were destroyed. So I did interrogate this salesman and asked him what happened to the documents, to try to find out, and he protested mightily against being examined by a girl and he said that he had been humili ated a lot by everything that ha d gone on since the war's end, but the worst humiliati on he'd ever had to face was being interrogated by a female. 06:08:03 Q: Tell me a little bit ab out the trial itself. I'd love you to tell me a little bit about the trial itself, sort of describe what was going on, what it felt like, and any particularly interesting aspects of it. BZ: Well, there were three judge s and an alternate sitting at the side, facing the defendants on a raised kind of platform and opposite there were 21 chairs in the dock. And incidentally, Bill was talking about the selection of the defendants before Œ we could have selected 50 defendants worthy of the title but there were only 21 chairs so the prosecution was limited in that respect. And they were on either side to the front of the courtr oom and beneath them on a long table, a long, almost platform-y ki nd of apparatus, were the interpreters and the stenographers and in front Œ that was on one side Œ on the othe r side, in front of the dock were the defendants counsel, who were numerou s. I don't think that, I'm sure that every defendant didn't have his privat e lawyer, but there were severa l defense lawyers, some like Dix, 54 represented four or five defendants, others just represented one. But and then there 53 Volkswirtschaftliche Abteikung, or Po litical Economy Office (German). 54 Dr. Rudolph Dix, Hermann Schmitz™s Defense Counsel. 50 was the prosecution table, fairly close to the judges™ dais, but more toward the center of the room, and they had a table. Why the defense co unsels™ table wasn't alongside, I don't know Œ maybe so they could talk to their clients more re adily. Then behind the table at which the defense counsel were sitting were the chairs for the audience. The Farben case had a big press there, pardon me. Then in the gallery, in a balcony, there were observers, ordinary people who wanted to see the tr ial and the witnesses were kept in a separate room off the courtroom. There are many pictures of the courtr oom and particularly of the Farben defense. 06:11:48 Q: What was it like being there? BZ: Well, it was a little nerve-wrac king because the thing that made it worse was that Œ were the objections of defense counsel, which would come rattling into your earphones while you were trying to make a point. And after a while I decided that if I were going to get anything accomplished, I'd better put my earphones down and not listen to them, which is something I should not have said in public. But the Chief Justice, Curtis Shake 55 was very, very polite to me and there again ma ybe my sex helped me because I sure didn't get the lectures that some of the men got, nor was I a party to some of their brawls. I think the judges all, whether they were sympathetic to the prosecution or not Œ and none of them were sympathetic except for Paul Hebert 56, the dean of Louisiana Stat e Law School, of Louisiana Law School. He was the only pe rson who seemed to understa nd what the prosecution was 55 Curtis Grover Shake, Presiding Judge, International Military Tribunal. 56 Paul Macarius Hebert, Judge, International Military Tribunal. 51 doing and was sympathetic. Bu t the other threeŠwell, Merrell 57 doesn't count, but Shake and Morris58 were unfailingly courteous to me. No w, I left after the first countŠCrimes Against Peace Œ which we discussed in great deta il, after that was put in, I did not stay for the rest of the case, but I followed the case for a number of years, best I could and got letters frequently from Nuremberg and we had some friends on the Ne w York Times. When they'd get back from Germany, they wo uld bring me up to date, but there were brawls that were reported in the newspapers, in the New York Ti mes and in other publications. For example, Judge Morris at one point asked Drexel Sprecher how many more documents he intended to put in and Drex said ,ﬁ500,ﬂ and Morris just plain had a fit. He said, ﬁWe're going to be here for another yearﬂ and, ﬁWhy ca n't you curtail your evidence?ﬂ and ﬁYou're bringing in everything including the kitchen bathtub.ﬂ An d he really reamed Drex out in a very injudicial manner. 06:15:15 Q: What was the morale like over there among the prosecution team? BZ: It was not good because of what I told you before, that one of the judges was reported to have said that he couldn't see the difference betw een I. G. Farben and Du pont and that not only caused, was not calculated to lift up people's morale , but I decided or I felt th at it would be a good idea if we didn't lead off with Crimes Against Peace and lead off with all these innumerable charts showing I. G. Farben's organization and particularly where the defendants that Bill had so much to do with, where they fit into the hierarchy, whether it was manufact uring or sales or administration or 57 Clarence F. Merrell, Alternate Judge, International Military Tribunal. 58 James Morris, Judge, Intern ational Military Tribunal. 52 where. I think it might have been better if we had led off with Slave La bor or some of these atrocities which might have created some interest in Morris. It wo uld have been extremely difficult but that was the sort of thing that would throw you off base and you'd have discussions about it until all hours. Discussions of strategy and how to cope with a couple of the judges, who were obviously hostile. Then again I might have had an advantage, Randy, not onl y because of my sex but I might have had an advantage in that I was one of the first to lead off wi th a presentation of the prosecution's case, so that thei r patience might have been in better shape at that time. 06:17:46 WZ: I think, and th is is all in retrospect, on the political side, I hadn't any idea how the judges were selected to sit on particular cases. I know generally that the way the judges were selected here in the United States. The chief judge of the United States Supreme Court refused to let any Supreme Court judges come over, he refused to let any District Court judges to come over, so that you really got a potpourri of people from various states of the countr y. However, just as cautious as we were in the sele ction of the prosecution staf f for I. G. Farben, for example, and I think basically for better or worse, we felt that the best people we were getting would go to I. G. Farben and the other industrialist cases, if those lawyers wanted to work those cases you see. There should have been some technique for evaluating which judges were better prepared to serve on an I. G. Farben case, for example. Paul Hebert belonged there, Morris of North Dakota, obviously didn't belong there and you know, I'm speaking without knowing any of these peop le but from what I've heard. That part of the process was faul ty, but if you su ggested that to Telford Taylor, he would possibly say, ﬁLook at what we had to do to get a document tr anslated,ﬂ you know, and delivered to the 53 defendant and so on and so forth. And of course it was very, very Œ the difficulty in the whole operation, having sat on the Supr eme Court of New York for 10 years myself and having since my retirement spent a good deal of ti me looking at the two because nobody wants an yone of any age to go to his grave without having sat 500 hours watching the O. J. Simpson case, you know. The selection of judges is part of the function of an administrative judge, who ought to know his people and their backgrounds and their pred ilections sufficiently to assign them sensibly to cases. This was beyond comprehension in Nurember g and probably beyond having being able to work out. But I don't know what kind of curriculum vitae Telford Taylor had with respect to e ach of the 33 judges who came over, but it would seem to me that somebody made these assi gnments and I can only assume that they were made on a helte r-skelter basis, which was unfortunate. 06:21:54 BZ: That's true, they were picked on the basis of their volunteering to go . Now, that didn't mean that we didn't have some very good judges. Out of our personal knowledge, I think that we could name them. And when I say good judge, I don't mean th at they should have been given the litmus test for whethe r they were for the prosecutio n or against the prosecution. I think, though, that they did require a degr ee of sophistication. I f eel they should have had background on the whole German gestalt, the whole German business. If nothing else, the rise of Hitler, what he did, wh o he was, how he succeeded in taking over an entire continent and how he almost succeed ed in taking over the rest of the world. WZ: And what kind of work th ese judges did as lawyers, what their backgrounds were. 54 BZ: And how skillful they were in handling a trial of this really great significance, great importance. Q: What was local reaction to the trials, from your per ceptions, being over there? BZ: That's a hard one for me. WZ: It's a forgettable part of hi story. When we make the turn into the twenty-first century and all the remaining people in their nineties and so forth and the children of thes e concentration camp survivors also go deep into Social Security, I don't think the trial will have very much more significance than the Civil War, whic h will be that much older again, in terms of centuries. It's going to be forgotten. But the history is there. BZ: Of course, except for international law scholars. WZ: Yes, well, again Œ an d they know what they have taken out or they'll be able to find out what they have taken out in terms of in ternational law. But look at another reason that I was not eager to get involved at the last gather ing last March was because I know from the work that Belle was doing that they were busy writi ng resolutions concerning the es tablishment of th e International Criminal Court at the Hague as well as Bosnia an d the apprehension of thos e war criminals, and so on and so forth. And ever ybody was so involved emotionally a nd I'm involved emotionally, too, but I cannot escape from the politics of the situation a nd the difficulty of deciding to take these indicted war criminals out of Bosnia and deliver them to the Hague if you are in e ffect the United States of America. Because the most significant thing politically about the difference between Nuremberg and what we're doing now, or tryi ng to do now, is the fact that we had won a war and these people were our prisoners, these defendants were. There wa s no question of deli vering any one of the defendants to the dock in Nuremberg, you did it. 55 06:26:33 Q: But what I was trying to as k you was, at the time of the trials, was there a local reaction? WZ: In Germany? Q: Correct. WZ: Germany was so Œ what I sa w of it, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, was so badly torn up and devastated that the Germans wanted to have a bed to sleep in and they wanted to have a place to eat in and they wanted to have some food on the table and this was beyond their enmities. The enmities by and large evaporated with the end of the war. They had to su rvive; the problem was survival. And not only did we not interfere with their surv ival, with the Marshall Plan and money that we pumped into Germany and the other devastated countries and Japan, we rebuilt their factories and put them on their feet, you see. BZ: They were hostile, they were hostile to the trials, naturally. That's a generalization, but neither Bill nor I are any tests of public opinion because we simply didn't d eal with the public. We have read accounts by Re becca West and other journalists and re porters but we would not be able to gauge the German reaction at all. Q: I would love toŠ 06:28:19 End of Tape Three 56 Tape Four 07:00:50 BZ: We talked a great deal about the tensions created by the difficulties of the place we were working in. Incidentally, I have n't even mentioned the freezing cold of Nuremberg or the dust of Nuremberg. But th ere was a tension, a very importan t tension that was created by the shift in our policy towards the Soviet Republic. In the fall of 1946, befo re the trial even began, our Secretary of State, James Byrnes 59 had made a speech at Stuttgart, in which he indicated that it was ﬁobvious to some peopleﬂ, quote, ﬁsome people, that we were going to end up with a conflict with Russia Œ in a c onflict with Russia,ﬂ and he intimated that we would certainly need the Germans on our side. Well, as Bill once char acterized it, here was the United States Government, sitting with this wet baby on its lap, that baby being the Nuremberg trials. So we on the prosecution never knew from da y to day whether or not the rug was going to be pulled out from under us and, until the indictment was served in the United States, could we draw fr ee breath and know that the I. G. Farben case was going to actually take place. I think that that, incidental ly, I think that the court might have been very sensitive to that fact, too, that instead of punishing thes e defendants we ought to welcome their expertise in the mart ial arts and in chemistry and in warfare generally. 07:03:48 59 James Francis Byrnes (1882-1972), Representa tive and Senator from South Carolina; Secretary of State 1945-1947. 57 Q: What about the emotional toll of abso rbing so much diffic ulty of the nation? BZ: I didn't get the question. Q: What about the, personally, what about the em otional toll of absorbing so much difficulty of the nation? BZ: Oh, there was a toll , there was a very, a very definite toll. I can't quantify it, but I had thought before I went there that I knew a great deal about the atroc ities that had taken place, but it seemed to me that every day was a fresh revelation. I think that after a while, one became inured to it. I remember hearing myself say, it's hard to believe of me, but I rememb er one of the analysts coming to me once with a story about experiments on five people and I said something unpleasant like, ﬁWhy would you bring me a document about five people wh en we have documents which involve several hundred people,ﬂ and that's a perfectly horribl e kind of comment to make. When I came home from Nuremberg, or shortly thereaft er, a little girl fell in a well, I think it was in Texas, and this entire country held its breath until that child was retrieved. But a million little girls like that and boys were murdered by the Nazis and the fact is that the world did very little about it. 07:06:07 Q: What about the resu lts of the trial andŠ BZ: Well, as I indicated before, there were, th ere was general acquittal on both the commission of aggressive war and on conspira cy to prepare and wage a war of aggression. There were sentences for the misuse of civilians, slave labor, not for medical experiments, no convictions, and there were sentences for the plundering of the industries of the countries that the Nazis occupied because the I. G. Farben defendants walkedŠm arched Œ right along with Wehr macht and took over all of the 58 chemical factories of the country involved. If a company was viable, they put in their own management. If the company was bo rderline financially, they disman tled the factory or laboratory and shipped it back to Germany. And that we nt on in country after country including Norway's hydro-electric installations , which were the largest in Europe at the time. Q: On these slave labor charges, wasn't there some defense in terms of the necessity of it? BZ: Oh, yes, well, that was the defense throughout, as Bill explained. Either that they were ordered to do it, or that they had to do it as a pa triotic German when his count ry is at war. But it was always the defense of superior orders and many of the defendants who we re not convicted on the slave labor count, said they knew nothing about it. Well, we had memorand a from employees of I. G. Farben to the Board of Direct ors, explaining the necessity of having the SS guard there at all times. One of these memo s said that the Belgians and the French are very surly. They don't say anything, but their looks are so hostile that it is better to have the SS guard there at all times. They went on to say, and as far as the Jews are concerned, they are intolerable, just that. So that, notwithstanding that, many members of the Board of Directors said they didn't see th at memo, they didn't see any of the memos on the injections that were being carried on, on any of the experiments whether they involved injections or not. They didn't kn ow about the poison gas. 07:10:04 Q: Did it anger you to learn of the sentences, or lack thereof? BZ: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I was in the States at the time. There is a wonderful picture of which I do not have a copy and that is th e picture of the prosecutors as the decision is being read by 59 Shake, and they say a picture is worth a thousand words, you can see the shock and the dejection of Sprecher and DuBo is and Amchen and the others, Linscott(ph). It was a very telling picture. If the museum doesn't have it, it surely should get it, but of course I was just stunned by the decision. Then it was eventual ly Œ when it was reprod uced, but I did get a letter from General Taylor saying that he was sure that I was disappointed and that they were all disappointed but that he had felt that we had made an important contribution to international criminal law and to think of it in that respect. Th en I received a fu ll copy of the, of Hebert's dissen ting opinion and that indicated that some of our work had struck fertile ground, but it was a two to one opinion and both Shake and Morris were very provincial people. I don't know how much they read or how much they studied, but they, from the outset, could not believe that these very resp ectable former businessmen could be guilty of such perversion. WZ: Just to include in yo ur record: five or six statistical number s, in the 12, in th e 13 trials, the 12 plus the International Military Tribunal, 199 were tried, there were 36 death sentences, 23 life sentences, 102 prison senten ces, lesser than life, of course, and 38 acquittals. When we speak of this disappointment in terms of the sentencing, the impr ession should not be gathered that there weren't any severe sentences put out. Now, of the 102 prison sentences, that's where I believe that the Clemency Commission did th eir nefarious work. Obviously the Œ those that had been hanged were beyo nd the mercies of the Clemency Commission and I don't know how many life sentences were reduced. I woul d think if any, it was a small number, but in the total number of prison sentence s, that's where, in my own description, the Clemency Commission opened th e doors of the prison without consulting with counsel, 60 without doing anything other than being appointed by the high commissioner and sitting for either 30 or 60 days and doing their job. 07:15:09 And this was a job they were selected to do. For my own, for my own pleasure, I point out that of the 33 ju dges Œ and we talked a lit tle bit about whether or not they were carefully assigned to their particular cases, should ha ve been more carefully considered. Of the 33 American judges, no Jewish judges. I don't resent that at all, I think it is good in terms of what they were trying, that there not be Jewish judges. There was no lack of Jews on the prosecution stand, but the way in which the Clemency Commi ssion was selected, and I do believe that the chief judge, the acting ch ief judge among the three members of the Clemency Commission was a Jew and maybe fr om the high commissioner's viewpoint, or possibly from Washington's viewpoint, I don' t know, I wouldn't say Washington in this situation, Harry Truman was the president. If indeed Judge Peck was Jewish, that was also a carefully contrived political maneuver to ease the passage of something politically desired, you see. Q: And do you feel that Cold War politics were part of this? BZ: Oh, unquestionably, unquestionably and that's all understandable, but Cold War politics or no, in my ken, that game should not have been played with thes e sentences, in the fashion in 61 which it was played, because I don't think it was ne cessary. No matter what Jimmy Byrnes said in Stuttgart, I don't thin k it was necessary to get the Germans on our side in the Cold War against Soviet Russia . It wasn't necessary. 07:18:17 BZ: May I say one more thing? In fairness, I must say that despite the Cold War politics and despite the fact that it a gave the prosecution, the various pros ecutions ulcers, the War Department held fast until the last tr ial was over and I think that the war de partment deserves al l the credit in the world for that. We were so sure that they were going to pull the rug out from under us. There was never the slightest indication from th at quarter that they were going to do anythi ng to diminish their support of the trials. WZ: Because of Harry Stimson, the Secretary of War. BZ: Well, he wasn't there at the end. WZ: Well, but Roosevelt, however he may be blameworthy in co nnection with concern with the Jews of Europe during the war, Roosevelt was foursquare for the trial of war criminals. Harry Truman was foursquare for th e trial of these criminals. BZ: Well, the State Department certainly wasn™t . That's all, let's not pick a bone about it. Q: Let me ask you your feelings about a few people who were majo r players at this time, if you had personal contact with them. Judge Jackson, Telford Taylor I think you both know. WZ: We both know Telford exceedingly well. Q: DuBois? 62 WZ: Great friend of Belle's. He's dead now, but we became frie ndly, too, after the war, and I never even discussed with him later on. We'd visit them at their home , they'd come up here and visit us and I never said, Joe, you re ally were a horse's behind with von der Hyde Œ look what has happenedŠ BZ: Let's not get in to that one episode. WZ: No, no, no, n o, no, no. I'm saying we ne ver did, you know. It ju st evaporated, it was an event. 07:20:48 Q: But what I'm asking is your feelings about the way some of these men conducted themselves and what affected the hearings. WZ: They did the best they could. Go ahead. BZ: Joe DuBois was a very fine administrator in the Treasury Department. He was an assistant General Counsel, he esta blished the War Refugee Board, whichŠ and administered it. And he had several, to use a common word, he had several tickets so far as administration wa s concerned. And it was necessary Œ the reason I re commended that he be brought ov er was because I felt that the prosecution, in preparing the case, was a headless horseman, with people going off on their own adventures so to speak. I'm not talking about black marketeering, non-case adventures, but where the case was concerned they were going, they were making the deci sion as to what was important and what to do. Amchen ha d, in private life, and he had also worked for the government during the 63 war. He had been a trial lawyer and we certainly needed someone who had a great deal of trial experience. Drexel Sprecher had be en there from the beginning of th e IMT to the very end after all the trials were concluded. He still stayed to edit and publish these sets of books that you're aware of, so that he brought to the prosecu tion of I. G. Farben extraordinar y knowledge of both procedure and a feeling for individu al responsibility. He was always very grateful to Bill for pointing out that we had to Œ that it was all very well and good to lump all these men into one category under the theory of conspiracy, but that it was necessary to point ou t where they sat in the organization, what their influence was, what their domain was and what their peculiar liability was. 07:23:56 Q: What about the l eadership of Taylor? BZ: Well, Taylor was very good. He did, he could not cope w ith the mechanical problems any more than anyone else could. His deputy was Tom Erbin, who really worked very hard to get staff, to get bodies, to get machinery th at worked, that didn't break down, to adjudicate the impasses that occurred between rival teams for mimeographs an d duplicating machines, such as they were, antiquated as they were. Pardon me, they were Œ it was a tough job, not to me ntion the fact that they were dealing with, not all, but se veral prima donnas among the prosecu tors. So it was, I'm sure that in my lifetime I've seen better administrations, but I don't think that Telford's great forte was that of administrator, nor indeed was Tom Erbin™s. He was an excellent admi nistrator in private life, but the difficulties were, a lo t of them were just insurmountable. Q: What about moral leadership? 64 BZ: Oh, I think there was extrao rdinary moral leadership. I think that the morale, up until this Cold War business, I think that Taylor could inspir e great dedication, hard work and he could rally people to the cause, without any question. Taylor's problem was that he was Œ most people considered him rather col d. And he was, Taylor was a scholar, he wasn™t a hale fellow, well met. He had his circle of friends, he was not a good politician, in other words. On the other hand, if you went to him with a problem or if you went to him an d just said, as I did, ﬁThis is one monumental SNAFU and I have instructions to leave whenever I don't feel my services are being properly utilized,ﬂ he could be very understanding, indeed, warm. And I have letters, which are extremely warm, which he was not oblig ed to write at all, but also it shoul d be noted that he was one of the most eloquent men, both in writing and in speech, that I have ever met. I mean everyone talks about Jackson's eloquence, particularly in his opening an d closing statements which are really, I think will go down in history with the Gettysburg address, they were that touching and powerful. I think that Telford was equally eloquent. 07:28:08 WZ: May I get a word in here? First about DuBois. Joe DuBo is can be canonized for his devotion to the Jews, for the fight th at he made in the face of people like Rabbi Wise, 60 who wouldn't approach the President during th e war to tell him what was goi ng on. Like hi s counsel, his personal counsel who was with him every day, Sam Rosenman, Barney Baruch, who sat on the bench and could walk into the President's o ffice, supposedly at any time. The effort that the Jews made to bypass the State Department and get through to FDR is virtually this: it is not a proud part in my book of the Jewish history. DuBois got through. Du Bois and a few 60 Stephen Samuel Wise (1874-1949), U.S. Rabbi and Zionist Leader. 65 other non-Jewish lawyers in th e Treasury Department managed to incite the Secretary of Treasury, Henry Morganthau, 61 to demand that something be done and the War Refugee Board was set up. My little set-to with DuBois about von der Hyde and Haberland62 pales into nothingness against the totality of Joe DuBois's contribution that I know of, to the good part of the war effort an d Nuremberg. Telford, I must say for Telford, I've had, I was part of the circle, you know, the circle of friends. 07:30:42 WZ: Telford had an absolutely monumental administrative job, be cause although all of us who were there, were there because we were interested in what we were doing, all of us, after all the years of military service and so forth, had a whole kind of, a mass em otional problem, you know. We'd been away from home . . . BZ: Randy, before we conclude , I would like to read you one paragraph from Telford Taylor's final report to the Secretary of the Army, dated August 15, 1949. It was a report on the War Crimes Trials conducted, k nown as ﬁSubsequent Proceedingsﬂ and I th ink it is a very useful summary. He said, ﬁImportant as is the con cept of aggressive war and beneficent as the Hague and Geneva conventions may be, we can hardly expect much further judicial de velopment and interpretation of crimes against peace or war crimes, except of co urse in the unhappy event of another war. The concept of crimes against humanity however, if it becomes an establis hed part of international penal law, as it seems to be doing, will be of the greatest practical importance in peacetime, indeed it may 61 Henry Morgenthau (1891-1967), U.S. Secretary of Treasury 1934-1945. 62 Ulrich Hablerland, head of Lower Rhine Betriebsgemeinschaft [company staff] in 1943. Peter Hayes. Industry and Ideology: I.G. Farben in the Nazi Era (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 337. 66 prove to be a most important safeguard against fu ture wars, in as much as large scale domestic atrocities caused by racial or religious issues , always constitute a seri ous threat to peace.ﬂ 08:02:44 We have seen this happen in Ireland, in Bo snia, in Rwanda and in many, many other places, Burundi and many other places in the world and I believe that just as how we eventually got the genocide convention ratified by all of the peace-loving members of the United Nations, I believe that we will one day see a permanent, international, military court, established under the auspices of the United Nations, with an enforcement apparatus, which will put out these brush fires before they become sad and long sagas of reve nge and retaliation and brutality, because as is the case in Bosnia and elsewhere and as I said before , these wars, internal as they ma y be, which are directed against one religious or racial group, constitute a threat to the peace of every nation in the entire world. That's about all I have to say. Q: Now I am going to ask you because we started to talk off camera, if you feel that your experience with Nuremberg had any long term impacts on your life, on the way yo u think, on the way you live? BZ: Well, yes I do, I think that the Nuremberg principles stay with one. I think they cause one to believe that there is no higher dedication than dedi cation to peace and as i rritating as we find the United Nations, I don't believe we have any other choice but to support it and if anyone can point out to me a better way, I certainly would be interested. It's interes ting how much ever y citizen in not only the United States, in the worl d, from the youngest to the oldest, from th e religious to the non-religious, prattle about peace and so few of us try to do anything concrete a bout it. You have people 67 like Benjamin Ferencz and like Henry King of Ohio, who have since the Nuremberg trials, dedicated their entire, have spent this past 50 y ears dedicated to the streng thening of international law, to the perpetuation of the Nuremberg pr inciples and to the cau se of human rights. 08:06:33 Q: Personally impact? Was this a very pivotal experience for you? BZ: I think it was a ve ry rough experience, I think I was not prepared for it, probably, emotionally. Not mature enough to handle this constant assault on the senses and my husband has told me several times that it was a great, one of the greatest chapters in the lives of everybody who was at Nuremberg and years ago, not recently, not in many years, but years ago I used to say that it was an experience that one did not have to have, because it was pretty shattering emotionally. However, he may be right and I may be wrong. It certainly has had an impact on my life. Q: Bill? WZ: I can give you my impr ession on the impact of Nuremberg on Belle's life. BZ: No, do it on your life, Bill. Q: IŠactually, why don™t you talk to me about the impact it™s had on you? WZ: This was an important event in the history of the twentieth century. My life, between 1915 and wherever it goes from 1996, wa s encapsulated in the twentieth century. There we re two wars. I remember as a small boy, being taken to a parade, watching the AEF, the American Expedition Force, march back in 1919, up Fifth Avenue. I was sensitive to that war. When I was four years old I wore a soldier™s suit, wh ich was modeled on the so ldier's suits, the soldier's clothing in World War 68 One. I lived through the Twenties and the exaggerated responses to the first World War. I lived through, as a student and as an ad ult, the 1930s. I have been very well aware of every campaign for the presidency since Al Sm ith ran against Herbert Hoov er in 1928. This histor y is part of my life, the history of the entire century and the Nuremberg part of it is one that is terribly important because I participated in it, to the extent of which I partic ipated in the presidency of Jack Kennedy, in the political life of Bobby Ke nnedy and an awareness of Harry Truman, in trying to achieve a better society through politics, in which I was heavily engaged and so was Belle engaged. And a realization now, at this age, abou t the beauty and the value of the li fe of a small child. Nuremberg is connected with all of that. I see those children in the co ncentration camps, emaciated, frightened, wearing their clothes, I know how I want a child to look like and th ese things all fit a pattern you know. I have no illusions about my contribution to this society, but I don't downgrade or demean any of Œ it's had great, gr eat pleasures, it's had very difficult periods and periods of pain and they, they're part of most an ybody's life, including at that present time, when the people dear to you, either dying or very clos e and so on and so forth. Nuremberg was a thing that I'll look back upon with a great deal of pleasure and I have no complica tions about it. 08:11:50 I wish I could believe, because I know the importance of politics in everything that goes on on this earth, I wish I could believe that those pe ople are going to be picked up and taken to the Hague and tried. If we don't do it, nobody else is going to do it. But I think it's, I see all of the difficulties and all of the compli cations and if Nurember g is less than either of us would have wanted it to be, so be it. Bu t Nuremberg was important in my life and I think Nuremberg was 69 important in Belle's life. Although she chooses to talk of the pain , well she recovered from the pain of Nuremberg. We all recover from pain. I had coronary bypass surgery 21 years ago and I've forgotten about it, but I haven' t forgotten about Nuremberg. Q: Thank you both. WZ: What can I do? I mean for you folks? Can IŠ BZ: We thank you for being so patient. WZ: Yeah. 08:12:56 End of Tape Four Conclusion of interview.
