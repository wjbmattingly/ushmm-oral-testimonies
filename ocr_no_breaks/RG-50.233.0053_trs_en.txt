3 Vitsyuv [Vitsev, Wiciow] . [Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second transcripti on notes this as Vitsyuv. However, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is further from Ruscova than the distance Irving Hass indicates. There are many it now Š but Vit – Vitsyuv and there we™r e transported, loaded – loaded in trains, cattle car. My father was a traveled man , and he know that this is something not to believe ; and he was saying: Oh God, help me. So they loaded us in the car with all G erman soldiers with mixed -in Hunga rians which – from the Hungarian army. And w hatever we could take Š w e left the tables and kitchens, everything – you know – with the – the food on the table; and we just took whatever we could grab. In Vitsyuv , the transport which they loaded us in cattle cars , and then they sealed it, and we traveling. And going around , my father recognized, he says: Oh my God, we are no more in – in Hungary, we are in Poland. And he says: God Š where could they take us to Poland? We didn™t know about Auschwitz; we didn™t know about anything, and here we are – going at night. They didn™t give us anything to eat, and people were drinking their urine in the rail – in the car, crying ; and we had some – some of them were already suffocated to death in that railroad car. It took us about three and a half days to reach the destination. Interviewer: What time of the day did you get into the –? Irving Hass: We got in to – I would say, in the morning, about eleven o™clock Š in the morning. Interviewer: Do you remember when this was? Irving Hass: It was – I think – it was in 19 –. I – I would know it was in, uh, early Š end of April Š or early – about – about Š it was still snow. It was about April. Interviewer: Late April, early April? Irving Hass: Yes. They opened the railroad ca rs, and then there w as all SS men Š in front of the cars ; and they unloaded us. We stay – we – Interviewer: What did you have with you? Irving Hass: I had no baggage, nothing. That™s all I had, my clothes; and my father carried a valise. I don™t know what he took in his valise. Maybe he took whatever jewelry ; maybe he took whatever Š his praying things. And Š my mother had the little girl with her and my four sisters. Interviewer: So your entire family – 4 Irving Hass: Entire family; there was a man with a stick and said : Left and right . Interviewer: German or Hungarian? Irving Hass: German; t his was in – in Auschw itz. That was Poland, and we arrived in Aus chwitz. And a s we were going, I do n™t know what side I was going. It was the left or the right; and h e wa s segregating. And t hat™s the last time I saw my f ather and mother and my four sisters. I don™t Š say five sisters. It was four – five sisters ; my father and mother and five sisters; and my mother was crying. They took me away, and I wound up in the barracks; wooden barracks in Auschwitz. I thought I saw chimneys there and smoke and people going around. And the sleeping on a wood en shelf; it ™s like a shelf Š staggered. And one day in Auschwitz, people were assembling to go. And I didn™t care where they goin g; I jumped out of the barracks, and I got in the line. And the line was lucky; we were transferred to – Theresien stadt. And – and – Theresienstadt, I don™t know what that camp, that Theresienstadt, and we were – . Find out we were, I – I was out of Auschw itz. And I even was lucky; I didn™t get a number on my arm. I – Inte rviewer: Was this by cattle car as well? Irving Hass: Yeah; a nd I didn™t care, I didn™t rea lize it. I – th is transport, there were people lining up. In – in Auschwitz, could have been may be to go to the crematorium, I didn™t know. I was lucky that transport was g oing to Theresienstadt to work. And I wind up there, I was no more in Auschwitz; I was in T heresienstadt. And f rom there I was working. Interviewer: How long were you in Auschwitz then? Irving Hass: I would say I was in Auschwitz not more than four days. That was my luck because I got myself in that transport. And that from – from God Š gave me to mix myself in with the other people. Interviewer: So you took the initiative – Irving Hass: Initiative. Interviewer: – to join this transport? Irving Hass: I didn™t know where they were going. Interviewer: No. Irving Hass: I took the initiative , and this saved my life. 5 Interviewer: Yeah, yeah , yeah . Irving Hass: And I would – I – I would probably have been – been burned in Auschwitz just like my fath er and mother and five sisters. I was working in Theresienstadt there , and they were – they were taking us out to work. And w e were working – working on a highway, to make a highway. I remembe r we had Š the stones had to be standing up and flat. And each one, individual, put in by hand. And th ey had machinery they put me in; t hey were grinding stones. Today ™s date, I have to yell sometimes; I think I™m there. People tell me , don™t yell when you talk to me. Now , and it – my wife couple of times said , and some people also when I talk and I forget myself Š because I was working with a guy next to the stone machine, we couldn™t hear each other. I was screaming to – to say a word he should understand what – what it mean – what I™m talking. And f rom t hen on I™m thinking. I™m looking Š still on this machine ; and that I™m talking. So we were – I worked in there for – it last f or about, I would say, nine or ten months. Interviewer: What kind of people were working? Irving Hass: All mixed people from all over. I met people in –. I met an – a Italian with me in the barracks. Interviewer: So this transport –? Irving Haas: Transport was all mixed , the people from – from – from Poland ; from – from Š there™s no Romanian. Romania n did not send that time people to concentration camps. I know fo r a fact because the – we were in the Hungary. I was born under Romanian , and then the – the Hungarian took over. And – and o ur town was full of troops with Hungarians; soldi ers with the – with Germans, all integrated. Interviewer: Were there many Jews in this transport? Irving Ha ss: All Jews. Interviewer: All Jews; o kay, all Jews. Irving Ha ss: And t his tran sport was all Jews when I went Theresienstadt. And t hey were from – even from Italy ; Jews there , because we was – we were talking. Interviewer: Did you have a – a uniform? Irving Ha ss: They gave me that stripe. Interviewer: The striped uniform? 6 Irving Ha ss: That striped uniform, and it really was –. While we talk – wher ever I get a hold of paper, and had paper, I wrapped myself around Š under the uniform; kept you warm. And w e were getting one meal a day which is – a – la [?] – water and whatever. And I still did not care what I d o; so I was sleeping in the barracks , and I wa s going at night to go into places where I stole potatoes. I was small , and I crawled underneath ; and the guys used to tell me : You™re gonna be shot . I sa ys: What can I worry about to be shot? I came back with – with potatoes Š raw potatoes, and we were ea ting. I came back with – with whateve r. Think I went there in – in the – in the place at night, and I took chances. And m y luck was always with me, with my chances. Then we got another transport, and they – and they sent me out to another camp. And t hat – that transport, we were working in a factory. We were making some kind of a Š I don™t know what – what it – what it called Š some kind of a powder, or some kind of a –. W e were bagging in bags or something. Interviewer: Where was this? Irving Ha ss: I – I d on™t remember the town. It was close to – what it – to Š back to the Polish Š it – it™s a German – Interviewer: OK Irving Hass: – where back to the PolishGerman border u sed to be. The Polish occupied it after the war. Interviewer: Oh yeah, that would be near [ph ?] Irving Ha ss: Near , yeah. That – that – ther e was a town there, I don™t remember there ; and they – we were marching in the town, and – and then going back and so on. And I worked there for approximately six months. And after that, they – they send us to Flossenbürg. Flossenbürg was already closer to Š what ™d you calling Š in the middle of Germany. And t here I came into the camp , and it was completely – oh my – they had already – they had gas chambers there. I kno w for a fact because there a sign , Ar beit Mach t Frei ; brause bad s Š fine showers. And i n that place , I remember they had – they had – because a guy was telling me: We give you a shower there . And they also had, in that – in Flossenbürg they had a camp Š in the camp the people were gassed taking a shower ; when they thought they were going to take a shower. I was working in this – this labor kommando which they call, labor kommando . And we were going out – outs ide of town, and were – cleaning highways. We were – we were going and – and lifting, what you call it, railroad tracks. We worked on railroads and everything to correct whatever , and then we even worked in homes, big family homes Š in – 7 in their garden. We did all – all, whatever – whatever work we did for this time; and – an d from Flossenbürg, they picked some kommandos. And a kommando I would say, from us must have been maybe 30, 40 people with about four, five SS men. Interviewer: When did you arrive in Flossenbürg? Irving Ha ss: In Flossenbürg , I arrived in 19 –, by the end of – of, I would say, August of 1944. Interviewer: August of ™44; so in – in those – from spring until August you had been to Theresienstadt and then to [see Note above]. Irving Hass: , there; yeah. Interviewer: And then to Flossenbürg? Irving Ha ss: Flossenbürg; Flossenbürg was my last camp before the liberation. And there – where – i n that Flossenbürg, I met a fellow from my town Š in camp. Then I also met a cousin which is the – the son of that picture; t hat was his son, my cousin. And I couldn™t believe it Š what happened, and I said : You know, and I tell you, whatever the SS do, I am not gonna go hungry , whatever I can , I™m going to –. They marched us from Flossenbürg to different labor places. And t he war started g oing closer and closer. We also heard all kind of guns coming in. And then from Flossenbürg Š it was May, I would say, about April – April – April 20 or April – in April, the end of April Š they marched us into a forest – heavy forest. And that must have been, I would say, the day – the beginning of May. And they set up machine guns, and they killing us out – start killing . B y luck, I – was saved in a tree; and I heard after th at –, I watched from under the tree Š I was la ying down. They thought, all the Germans thought, that we were all killed out. We were about 40 people from the entire thing – were – a – alive. Some of them were shot in – in – in legs a nd some were –. I got shot in – in – from my shrapnel Š in my – in my right arm. And I was sitting there; and then the Germans changed their clothes , and they disappeared. Intervie wer: How many people were – were shot at this – ? Irving Ha ss: It must have been, I would say, close to about 300 peopl e. Interviewer: And you saying – Irving Hass: So w hen I was liberated, I remember an American soldier t ook me, and they already had the Ger – . The – the American people had Germans on trucks to 8 come and show ‚ em what – what happened in – in the forest; the dead people there. The Americans took the Germans back to the forest to pick up the – the dead people Š to bury ‚ em. Interviewer: How many people survived this? Irving Ha ss: I would say, we – we – I – I Š from my memory, because I was the only one who couldn™t walk, I was weighing – weighing only 70 pounds; all my bones were sand , and this soldier picked me up. And h e saw me bleeding , and I got some bandage aro und me and took me to a place. And h e gave us chocolate; he gave us the best food we could ever – I could never remember ; and we were really hungry. And h e was saying to – in English Š which I didn™t understand Š how they taking the Germans to pick up the people there. And they – they took them by – by the hundreds, you know, load them on trucks, to – to bury them. I got caught Š typhoid, which I didn™t know it was. I had a high fever, and I had a loose stomach. And h ere , this American soldier touched me, and he said I have a hot – very hot, cold, something Š temperature, a very high tempera ture ; and took me to hospital in Schwandorf [Schwandorf in Bayern]. That™s where it happened, close to Schwandorf. Interviewer: Schwandorf is where you were liberated? Irving Ha ss: That™s where I was liberated. I didn™t know when the war ended. But t hen I found out the war – I was in Schwandorf hospital, which the hospital was Catholic; the nuns were there. I did n™t know at time Š they cut me the fever off, and they brought me back to my weight. And I really – I could see in pictu res after that I was completely –. And a fter that, they let me loose , and I started home looking for my family. And I was seeing lists were comin g out all over, and I traveled to München; and then I w ind up in Frankfurt where I met some of my townspeople with an American soldier. And this soldier sent away my – my picture to America to find I found my uncle yet . And so he sent Š my uncle sent me a letter which his daughter wrote and send me some clothes. And this soldier brought me a package and was already contact with my cousin. And my cousin was – was saying, wrote me an d says we going to take him soon. And this was going around until 1947.

And I was so Š to give 18 you a thing that happened Š I had a – a teacher in Hebrew school. He was so strict , and he was threateni ng. He was threatening that he wa s going to tell our father that we were bad. Four boys of us, me and two other boys, run awa y. That time we ru n away back to another town which is Petrova [Petreve] , which is about eight miles , you know; we run away. We went into a barn, and it was thundering and raining and storming, and they couldn™t believe; and they were looking for us Š all over town s and eve rything. And finally they found us and : What are you doing here? We we re crying Š four of my friends , and he says – and he says : The father threaten – the teacher threatened us to tell the father that we were not studying what he – he taught us. So t hat™ s why we run away. And they – and they found us, and we sorry as the day that never happened; we ru n away. Interviewer: Why did he threaten to tell th at story? Irving Hass: He threatened to tell them – he was threaten us to tell our fathers that we were no good this week in school because we didn™t do our homework. Interviewer: Is that true? Did you do your homework that week? Irving Hass: We didn™t do it; we – we goofed off. Interviewer: You goofed off? Irving Hass : We we re playing similar to baseball with a stick and throwing to a ball. And w e were afraid, for the father was strict. He w as going to give me a punish that you don™t get this and so on. Interviewer: Strict father. And you were a good student. Were you a good student because your father was str ict? Irving Hass: The f ather was – was – I would say, yes. Today I would say yes; I could never forget my father. I repeat and think my father™s wo rds. My mother was just plain , but my father –. My mother was a soft woman, really quiet , you know, in ever ything, you know. I remember the day when I said I™m – I™m sorry some days I said ﬁnoﬂ to my mother. I wanted to go to my friend; and s he asked me for something, and I was going to my friend. I didn™t obey her, and then I came home ; I was sorry. I says : I™m sorry what I did. She says: Okay, we g et it done anyway. She aske d me to do a job or something. In – in today™s date, I™m – I™m thinking the word s why – why I didn™t obey her. Sometimes it come to you. Interviewer: If th e war hadn™t happened –? Irving H ass: If the war wouldn™t happen, I would probably be a lawyer. 19 Interviewer: You would have continued schooling? Irving Hass: Continue school and I would have been there, like to live on and go to higher education. Interviewer: Where would you have gone to school? Irving Hass: In the – in the school would – would be gone is right in Sighet [Sighetu , Maramaros Sighet, M áramarossziget, S ighetul Marmatiei, Sigut, Sihat, Syhot Marmaroski, Sziget] which is a big city of Máramaros [Maramure , or Satu Mare [Sakmir, Saktmar, Sathmar, S Szatmarnemeti] . Satu Mare was another big Š which a lot of people there. Interviewer: So you would have gotten your law degree and then –? Irving Hass: I – I would have been a lawyer, yes. I was the only boy in the family, and they were really treating me – I was thinkin g right now. With five sisters, to be one boy because my brother died , and he was really – my mother and father was really – take preference on him. Interviewer: What was your younger brother™s name? Irving Hass: Heschel. Interviewer: Heschel. So you would have become a la wyer , and would you have remained in Ruscova? Irving Hass: I would probably; I don™t know where I would remain, but Ruscova was no t the place for a lawyer. Maybe Poian which is further up, another town there, would be more industrialized , would be for a lawyer. Interviewer: Now, y ou must have, as the oldest, watched your sisters grow up. Irving Hass: I watched my sisters , and I really liked my sisters , you know. And I always separated , sometimes, they – they were fighting. The little one , you know, were always going where the big one is going. I™m talking to Hudia [sp, ph?] , you know. And I remember good, and then the – the mother w ill say take care of the little sister , Sarah , you know. Sarah was the youngest. Interviewer: Yeah, s o Hudia was fighting – Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: – with – with whom? 20 Irving Hass: Fighting with the – the other, with Heichu [sp, ph?]; and saying this, you do this, and telling the mother something, you know. There was always a fight , and I was the only boy. I couldn™t mix in , you know; but I sti ck up ‚cause I like my sister. I really sti ck up with my sisters. Really, during the war, I co uldn™t believe from five sister, one sister, her fri ends Š about ten friends from her class survived. Tape One, Side B Five friends of her survived and they came to the United States. I couldn™t Irving Hass: – believe my sister was close to the mother and they would not want to separate. Interviewer : What did your oldest sister want to be? Irving Hass: This I don™t know. My oldest sister was – you know girls at that time ; s he wanted to go to school and probably be a – a teacher , she wanted – or to make instructing how to sew or something, what – what ever . Interviewer: She attended public schools? Irving Hass: She attended public school, yeah. That™s where the picture is from, the public schools. Interviewer: All your sisters –y ou were saying when the Hungarians came? Irving Hass: When the Hungarian s came in and took over from the Romanian s, our schooling was already se gregated . But t he anti -Semitic – the Jews had it no way. Interviewer: This is when the Hungarians co me in? Irving Hass: When the Hungarians co me in. Interviewer: How was it under the Roma nians? Before we – ? Irving Hass: Under the Romanian s, we – we were much treated much better. One – one uncle of mine, which is my mother™s brother, lived in Romania; he survived. He did not have – not one man from – from Romania, which I know, went to concentration camp. All the Jews survived were only the Romanians. Interviewer: In your town, can you think of any bad experiences that you had under the Romanians? Irving Hass: They had – t he minute the Hungarians came in , and they started goi ng against the Jews and hitting; the local people, the Ukrainians, started painting things and 21 calling names and finding, you know. W hen Christmas came , we couldn™t even go out the street because they say we killed Jesus. Interviewer: These are the Ukrainians now? Irvin g Hass: Yeah . And w hen C hristmas came , they were dressing up and to go with bells, you know, like on Christmas Eve. And we were afraid to go out of the house because at that time they were really going and really beat you up or something. Interviewer: What about the Romanian s? Irving Hass: The Romanians, we didn™t have too much problems. Interviewer: No – no problems? Irving Hass: So far, I – I – I went to school under the Romanians; and t he teacher was from Romania. She was playing the piano in our school, and we used to surround her, teaching us whatever , you know; and – and I would say that under – the – he was the – the kai – the – the king, what™s his name? Interviewer: C arol? Irving Hass: C arol, yeah. And he was – wasn™t – maybe later on there was som ething in the Romanians; maybe in deep – in deep Romania. Anti-Semitic was in our town, the Romanian s; w e had no problem. Interviewer: So your teacher was fair? Irving Hass : The teacher was fair ; the – the police, the gendarme Š we used to call them. Inte rviewer: That™s right, they were your neighbors. Irving Hass: They were o ur – our neighbors, gendarme, that™s what the – the Romanian s called them. And t hey were nice and everything . Interviewer: Your classmates Š you had non-Jewish friends? Irving Hass: Y es; and they – they were not Š some Ukrainians, we had trouble in the classroom. Interviewer: But otherwise? Irving Hass: Otherwise , you know, in – in – in the school was really very nice , in school which I – which I – which I remembered. Interviewer: And your father d id a ll – did well in the business? 22 Irving Hass: My father made a living in the business. And he was working for a company was not from – not far from Romania. And this was mostly shipping material. You see, the town where I – where I lived Š ten miles was a big lumber. They cut lumbers you know like in Washington, the state of Washington. And from this lumber – lumbering business is big business. He built materials at home. Like you said, we built – we built a house from – from the lumber. Inte rviewer: Your father worked out of town? Irving Hass My f ather worked out of town for – since I remember him. Interviewer: Now, w hen you were going to school, before the Hungarian s co me in, had anybody in your family heard of Hitler or the Nazis? Irving H ass: I di dn™t. Interviewer: You had never heard of either? Irving Hass: No. Interviewer: And t here were no Germans? Irving Hass: I never kn ow – Interviewer: No Germans around? Irving Hass: – the Germans completely, no. Only when the Hungarians came in we already had never saw a plane in our town. When the Hungarians came in, we saw planes like – like a scouting planes flying around all over. Interviewer: Do you remember when the Hungarians came in? Irving Hass: Oh boy; m ust have been – been – been, I would say look up in history when they took over that – that territory. Interviewer: Yes, yes. Irving Hass: It was right from Czechoslovakia, they took over from. I think the Romanian took Satu Mar e. They came over ; the – the Máramaros was completely became Hungarian. Interviewer: Hungarian, Cluj , yeah , yeah . This was between classes. I remember you were saying you had finished class, but before you could continue school in the f all – Irving Hass: There was no more school. 23 Interviewer: There was no more school, because of the Hungarians – Irving Hass: They came in, that™s correct. Interviewer: You would have been fourteen, fifteen years old at the time. Do you remember the reaction of your family the day the Hungarians came in? Irving Hass: Oh, my – my father sai d that time , he didn™t like it. And h e says right away that they going to be tied in to the Nazis Š and they alre ady tied in to the – to the Germans. My father knew the Germa ns because in the factory where he was working, there was this college graduate Š and a doctor, and the son was a doctor; he was very friendly with the president of the plant. And the son was a doctor, and he was say ing already what – what – what to be reading papers and listening to news . They had broadcast radios and so on and the – the – the – this guy, the p resident – of other – of Hungary was a Mik lós Š what™ s his name Š Mikló shy [sp, ph?]? Interviewer: Horthy. Irving Hass: Horth y, Horthy Š yes. Horthy was tied in to the Germans. And – and he™s say ing it™s not going to be good. And my father foresee that. Interviewer: So y our father had some idea of how bad the German s might be? Irving Hass: How bad the Germans might –, right. Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. Did he have any trust in the Hungarians; as someone who had fought in the Hunga rian army-? Irving Hass: No, th e Hungarians occupied Romania. They took some houses away from us and put into the – to the – they put the – the troops, you know, to station there. They slept in some homes. Interviewer: They took some of your property away? Irving Hass; Not of our property, they took some other – other homes. Interviewer: Other homes, but not your house? Irving Hass: Not my house. They took some other homes where it was convenience . We were near to th e – to the police, and that maybe saved us. Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. But your father, who had been in the Hungarian army, had been born a Hungarian citizen Š he was afraid of becoming a part of Hungary? 24 Irving Hass : That™s correct. My father kno w what – what was up to. He couldn™t believe it whe n – when they came in , and he saw right away. He already spoken to my mother. W henever he wanted us not to understand, he was speaking Hungarian in the house, you know, so we don™t understand what they were thinking. And – and I know we did n™t . And then my father was talking to his friends, you know, and so on. I know he™s going his friends, and t hey were talking politics Š what™s gonna happen . And he said it doesn™t look good, and he didn™t believe that this Hungarian is gonna sell us down to the – to the Nazis completely. That Horthy did that. Interviewer: Yeah. So that when your father, your family , spoke Hungarian, it was not out of love, but just for – Irving Hass: Just before they were educated and they spoke the language. Intervie wer: Yeah, yeah. What else happens after the Hungarians come in? Do you remember things that happened? Irving Hass: They picked certain peop le, like I said before , which they needed for labor camp. Interviewer: Young men? Irving Hass: Young men. To – then they were working and building defense lines. And I remember they were building in from big lumber trees and making that a tank could not go through Š with holes, you know, like zigzagging . And then they come back , working on the day; and come back. So did my father. They took him certain days ; he couldn™t go to work. Interviewer: So sometimes you father was drafted to work? Irving Hass: D rafted to work ; and so – and then all of a sudden, they take the younger guys, and they transfer them to Ukraine. Interviewer: But not your father? Irving Hass: Not my father. Interviewer: Did he continue working in the lumber? Irving Hass: He continued – he continued working both ways, where they took him. Wherever a day free, he went back to work wher ever he can . But when they took the young er guys to Ukraine, and then we fou nd out that they were – they killed them there. Before even we heard they resist the Nazis. In Ukraine, they killed a 25 lot of people, and we – we heard about i t from some Š and what you call this; like people come back and escapes and so on . Interview er: You were too young for this? Irving Hass: I was too young to go and work in a labor wit h a pick and shovel. I was only a kid. Interviewer: What else happened to you? Irving Hass: They gave us ration s because we didn™t have food. They – they already restrict us on food what we could eat. Interviewer: So you had rationing already? Irving Haas: You couldn™t get certain – certain commodity . The Jews would not get it. Interviewer: What about school? Irving Hass: I – I didn™t go to school. Interviewer: You stopped going to school – Irving Hass: I stopped going to school. Interviewer: – or did they tell you, you can™t go? Irving Hass: I – I stopped going to school. Interviewer: What about your sisters? Irving Hass: Neither did th ey go to school. Interviewer: So even the youngest stopped going to school? Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: Do you remember why that was so? Irving Hass: I think the teachers weren ™t there. Th e – the teacher s from Romania went – went back or something. They had no teachers in my – in – in my town. Interviewer: Uh huh. So Romanian teachers left? Irving Hass: The Romanian – a ll the teachers left. There was no Hungarian – Romanian teachers. 26 Interviewer: So school closed? Irving Hass: School for the Jewish people Š were no schools. We were going just to cheder Š Hebrew school. Interviewer: Were there any Hungarian teachers, Hungarian schools? Irving Hass: I don™t – nothing I could remember. Interviewer : What about movements? You know Š you ™re walking in public? Irving Hass: Walking in public; I could walk maybe a mile. We were close to the synag ogue. And w e were comple tely restricted like to go; we couldn™ t go no place. I couldn™t travel to a different town. Interviewer: So what did – what did you r fam ily do dur ing these years of Hungarian occupation? Irving Hass: They – they were just trying to live it through. Whatever – whatever mo – mother grew in the garden, we were eating . And w hatever corn we would have ; we would have every morning Š cornmeal. To make it with boil ing water, cornmeal, we had a mill which grinded corn. From corn to make flour. So in the morning that™s all I remember sin ce I was Š I would say, since I – I –. The– the Romanians were not –. That ™s all we had was cornmeal for breakfast. Intervi ewer: Cornmeal. Irving Hass: Cornmeal Š you mak e it with water, and it boils; you mix it in. they call it, okay. In Romania, they call it so we had every morning and milk. And t he only way we co uld get milk is to know some of these people in town. Some of these Ukrainian people. I don™t know what you call it, Ukrainian there I remember the word what you called that people. And the m ilk we used to get from cows, and we milk it right. Or w e had our own cows. My uncle had a cow , and we g et milk from him , and we only lived about half a mile. Interviewer: And y our sisters, w hat were they doing on an average day? You think back. Irving Hass: From an average day, wh at sisters did, gi ve her a pencil and a piece of paper and draw. And i f it™s cold, we would sit and looking out of the window. And i f it ™s summer, they were sitting out on the – on – on – on outside. Interviewer: And they couldn™t work. Irving Hass: They couldn™t work, correct. 27 Interviewer : Too young to get married? Irving Hass: They™re tree – they™re children. Interviewer: No school? Irving Hass: No school and they were just educ ating themselves whate ver they could get a hold of and read. Interviewer: Were there – were the Jewish schools Š did they expand in any way, during this period? Irving Haas: The Jewish school ex – expanded but they mostly concentrate on boys. Interviewer: Boys, yes. Irving Hass: Girls were very limited time to go to – to school Š to Hebrew school. They was concentrated mostly on boys. Interviewer: Yeah. Did you r family ever consider leaving? Irving Hass: The only one would consider leaving , he says, where would we go? My father used to say, you™re going to Š if you leave, you have another problem. You don™t know nobody, and you got the same thing all over again. Especially you got a – you got a mark on yourself Š you™re Jewish. That™s t he minu te he said, r ight away, you™re Jewish, you – you identified yourself. So you can™t go . If you want to go to Budapest, want to go to Bucharest, you couldn™t. At that time, I don™t know how strictly the borders were, and I would say the borders were strict. But there were still packages coming in. Only Czechoslovakia was free. Interviewer: Until the Nazis came? Irving Hass: ‚Til the Nazis. But I™m talking free from America to get mail . I know my uncle was shipping packages. Interviewer: Your uncle in America? Irving Hass: In America Š shipping packages to us. We could not receive it in Romania; we could not receive it in Hungary Š only Czechoslovakia. And they had to go Š I remember my father had to go about 40 miles Š to go with a wagon. A guy would take him to go into the Czech o – into Czechoslovakia, which is – was against Š he smuggled in to get the package. And i n the package w as clothes Š whatever they got . I remember peanut butter Š which I nev er had peanut butter 28 in my life; and h ere comes a package an d two jars of peanut butter. This was a delicacy when we got it. Oh my God, we were fighting. The clothes – [Note Interviewer and Irving are talking over each other.] Interviewer: Your uncle in America, the uncle in America Š he™s your – on your – father™ s side. Irving Hass: Father™s side – Interviewer: Father™s brother. Irving Hass: Yeah. Shipped it to an address in Trbouıany [Note This Czechoslovakian town is way more than 40 miles from Ruscova. Ruscova is at a far distance from Czechoslovakia; Ruscova i s closer to Ukraine where there is a town called Trebuıany. It is more likely to be able to be smuggled into Ukraine in a night than into Czechoslovakia.] I remember the – the town. Trbouıany was Cze choslovakia, and that™s why we had to go and pick up the package . And p ick up the package at a – at night Š ge t yourself smuggled into Czechoslovakia; across the border and bring in th e package. If you get caught, you probably be shot. Inter viewer: How long did this go on Š this – life? Irving Hass: This was go ing on for about, I would say, eight to ten months, a year. Interviewer: So the Hungarians come in. The – Irving Hass: The Hungarians came in, was already – we already almost converted to Nazism then . The Hungarians were with the Nazis. But the Hung arians with – had with them Š Hungarian soldiers were with about three or four special Nazi G auleiters with them already. They were planning what was going to happen to us. Interviewer: Now w hen – when i s the ghettoization? When was the – the yellow st – badges and – and the – the story that you began w ith the Š the, you know, the cattle car and the trains ? Irving Hass: The yellow badges was coming on already when the Hungarians came in with the – with a bunch of Nazis, what are called Nazi soldiers. And th ey were trying to identify us. If you want ed to go out of the house, you couldn™t have out of the house without a yellow badge and star. Another thing, the Jewish girls were making this, and they looked nice decorated on their clothes. You know, everything we would look and something, you know, and all of a sudden a nice yellow star is – is on the dress , or on the jacket Š sewed on; and is decorated. 29 And this is just to understand it between the townspeople. Our townspeople Š to – to know who is who. Inter viewer: When did you first see Germans Š in Ruscova? Irving Hass: The Germans Š I saw them with the – with the Hungarians. When they – when they marched into our town with the – with the Hungarian army Š with horses; with all kind of tanks Š all kind of cannons, vehicles. You – oh my God, we were scared to death , you know, from the windows looking how the soldiers walking in with this armament. And then with – with the Hungarians, they were marching in. But there, already , was with each unit, was already a German assigned to them. Interviewer: Were you ever forced to move out of your house? Irving Hass: ‚t il they came us and took us away. Interviewer: ‚ til the spring of ‚44? [ Note previous transcription has ™42, but it is difficult to really discern what is on the tape. A ccording to many documents, Germans came to this area of Romania in 1944.] Irving Hass: They only took away – only took away certain homes where – where they wanted to have their headquarters. Interviewer: So there was no ghetto in Ruscova? Irving Hass: In – in – in Ruscova, right away they took us to ( Felshevisho, Ober Visho, Ober Wisho, Oyber Visheve, Vishya, Viso). [ Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second transcription note s this as Vitsyuv. However, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is further from Ruscova than th e distance Irving Hass having a ghetto.] And – and – and – and there ™s Š the ghetto was in But I was lucky; we were at least eight, ten days there ; and they took our transport. That ™s where the ghetto . But t hey march us about 30 miles. Everybody, you know, walking; we had to walk 30 miles Š whatever baggage we had. Interviewer: So from Ruscova to you had to walk? Irving Hass: Had to walk. And f rom there Š where a railroad car ; ther e was a railroad already. Interviewer: And h ow much time did you have to get ready for this trip? 30 Irving Hass: Time Š was not even maybe four, five hours. They just came. You in this area Š wherever we were , there in the ghetto Št here was a ghetto. Wha t you call this a ghetto or a – a – a –. They took from so many towns; there must have been thousands of ‚em, you know. And they – they were all in transport. Interviewer: Yeah. Irving Hass: So we from Ruscova Š we were st aying in one area. Interviewer: In – in Irving Hass: In the we ge t in one area. When the transport came, we were going in the transport. Interviewer: I mean in – in Ruscova. Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: When in Ruscova, you™re told to go to Vitsyuv [ Note Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: How much time did you have to get ready for that trip Š for the walk? Irving H ass: For the walk, was three – maybe two days. Interv iewer: Two days to walk there. And what did your family take? The whole family™s together – Irving Hass: I don™t – I only remember my father had a valise , and my mother had a valise ; and we had absolutely nothing Š the children. Interviewer: And the children walked? Irving Hass: Whatever – yeah – Interviewer: All the children walked? Irving H ass: Yeah, all of us. Whatever – whatever my father had in the valise, I would say, he might have some dollars Š because my uncle, when every time he send a letter, there was a twenty. Because I remember as a kid – as a kid, I open a book, a nd I found there tw o twenties Š American twenty -dollar bills. And I see to my father Š he says, you know, he ha s to go to change it Š to Vitsyuv [Note probably . You know, we had to go and trade. You couldn™t spend it, you got to get Š but there was people , you know, who was dealing with it. And h e had to trade 31 them in. But when my uncle sent a letter Š was a twenty -dollar bill. He sent it for my grandfather ; for my father. And m y grandfather, I told was like this [?] Š spen d; because he used to get a twenty dollar bill. I know when Passover came, he sent us money for wine. You know, before all this happened, and buying wine and so on Š everything to prepare for the Passover. Interviewer: So you™re walking to the – to – to Vitsyuv [Note probably and all you have are the two suitcases . And who is pushing you to walk; t hese are Hungarian police? Irving Hass: Hung – Hung – no, t here was Hungarian and what you call Š Ukraines. Interviewer: Ukrainians – Hungarian and Ukrainian guards. Irving Has s: Guar ds. And in Vitsyuv , [ Note we already had Germans there, completely staffed with Germans, directing to get loaded in the railroad cars. Interviewer: And it took you two days to – to get there and , of course, nobody kne w what was going to happen next. Irving Hass: We didn™t know. Maybe my father knew they were going to transport us someplace , but he didn™t know ther e – there is a crematorium. But when – when I sat , we were on the railroad car already , traveling nights, a couple of night s or so on, and he says we™re in Poland. And m y father recognized , when, you know, he traveled that by train – so. And all of a sudden we found ourselves in Auschwitz, and we get out Š open the doors in Auschwitz in the morning ; ‚bout ten , eleven o™ clock. And every railroad car , and my God, we saw thousands of people on the side. A nd – and these Germa ns with these whips and so on Š left and right and left and right. Interviewer: Now, d uring the walk from Ruscova – Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: W ho were yo u walking with, you recall? Irving Hass: I was walking with my townspeople. Interviewer: I mean with anyone in particular? Irving Hass: I was walking with my father, and then was walking with three of our neighbors. And [ Note hear a lot of rustling of paper ] this particular girl was my neighbor, and the brother – here [Note hear a lot of rustling of paper] Š Slomow itz [sp, ph] was his nam e Š here.

I™m – we™re – we™re still look – looking now at the walk. [Note Interviewer and Irving Hass are talking over each other.] Irving Hass: The walk, we were walking the entire – Interview er: Do you remember talking or being silent? Irving Hass: Talking Š no you couldn™t talk. You surely talked to each other Š in Yiddish , and these guys were just march and keep on going. But you couldn™t –. I think they – they took the entire town in one time. Three hundred of families from Ruscova was marched out on the same day. Interviewer: And then how many days did you spend in Vitsyuv ? [ Note probably Irving Hass: In Vitsyuv [Note , I would say maybe two or two and a half. And I did not come all of us on the same transport. That™s why t hey segregated us, and some what happened, maybe in different barracks or something. I remember we – I was, from my town, from the Vitsyuv [Note , must have been at least – . Even my cousins, him did not come on my transport which is my – my mother™s Š my – my aunt. Interviewer: Mother™s brother? Irving Hass: My mother™s – my mother™s – Interviewer: Brotherin-law? Irving Hass: Brotherin-law Š didn™t come on the same transport. He came two days later. So I™m – I have a memorial – that every – I know in the Jewish, after the d eath, you got to know when your father died, you have a date. My date Š I took the day arrived in Auschwitz. Interviewer: Do you remember the date? Irving Hass: The date arrived in Auschwitz I would say is – is in – in the month of May. So I™m taking it to maybe May – May – May 12 th to 14th. Whenever a Jewish holiday comes out in May, I™m taking Š we call ed it like bäum en [sp, ph] in Jewish [Note beymer is Yiddish for trees], this is a tree day. Trees is planted, and I took that day for mine –. Because when I know they came to Auschwitz, they 33 had no – not two days even left over. They undressed th em right away naked , and they – and they – and they feed them to the ovens. Interviewer: Now who put you on the train in were the Hungarians and Ukrainians again? Irving Hass: No, there w as alre ady Germans. Interviewer: Germans. Irving Hass: Germans with the Hungarians bu t the Germans were completely – Interviewer: In command? Irving Hass: In command. They were tell ing what railroad car and they – everything is gotten in railroad cars. Interviewer: Were you able to eat anything when you were in Vitsyuv ? [ Note Irving Hass: In they gave us Š one meal , I remember, is bread. And they had a soup or something. And p eople which have in the – smuggled in the Š you know there was people, when they ca me from – Interviewer: Carrying food. Irving Hass: Carrying food ; and maybe my father and mother had some food in there. Interviewer: Yeah; that™s why I was a sking you whet her they – Irving Hass: So I think, in the valise, for my sisters. I know my mother was – was given something to eat. But when we were in the railroad cars, we didn™t have nothing to eat. And th at thing was really – which I have known for a f act Š people were crying and drinking their urine Š children. Interviewer: Your family was in one car? Irving Hass: We were all in one car. Interviewer: The other people in the car were from the town? Irving Hass: Also, there were about three or four famil ies in the town. There was other people from Leordina [?], from different town s. Interviewer: So you knew a lot of the people that were in the railroad car? 34 Irving H ass: So I would say I knew – about – I would say about more – more than eight or ten people from the – from the same town was in that car. Inte rviewer: In that car ; plus your family. Irving H ass: My family. And I – I would say because we didn™t – and they were so tight in the car; and I™m not kidding you. Pain [?] from standing; we were just sitting down on top of each other. And – and c ramped in there ; and when we were hearing someb ody scre aming , and there were the SS Š riding on top of the cars and the si de of the cars. Each car got a – . You see, when – when from , the transport came in Š no more Hung arian. Were all German troops ‚ til you hit Auschwitz. Interviewer: On the train? Irving Hass: On the train. They were already in command to take on guards on the train Š everything. Interviewer: You still have you r suitcases – insid e the train? Irving Hass: Inside the train, yes. But not too – too many people had the suitcases. They didn™t take away anything for you from the ghetto. Whatever you carried with us; if you ca n™t drag it , you drag it. In Auschwitz, ther e was the unpacking. Because when I said when I saw the things, you know, from the Nuremberg Trial Š that booklet, and that showed how – how they unloaded people; and they had everything to get undressed. People had dollars or diamonds Š whatever Š sewed i n. All of them were taken away. And then they cut their hair. And t hey were even saving the hair to make mattresses or something. Interviewer: Now in the – in the cattle car Š who were you sitting with? Do you remember –? Irving Hass: I was – Interviewer: – what it was like? Irving Hass: I was sitting in the cattle car mostly next to – was her father . Th is girl was also in the cattle car with me. Interviewer: Friends y our age? Irving Hass: That was my age , and – and she died of tuberculosis; this what I™m saying. Interviewer: Yeah. Did – did you talk much? Was it – was the train quiet or was it noisy? 35 Irving Hass : I wasn™t able what to talk; I didn™t kn ow what to talk. I was talking oh my God Š I hear the people were crying. Food, we were thinking of food. Interviewer: So if you h ad to describe what it was like Š crying? Irving Has s: We were crying all the way. We were crying and yelling , and – and really saying : Why did God do this to us? Interviewer: Yeah. So crying – yelling. Irving Hass; And – and y ellin g, something that said: I need – I want a drink ; I – I™m dying. And c ertain people were – were actually squashed there. I know for a fact there was a couple of people dead on the car which I don™t know. Interviewer: Two people died there. Irving Hass: Two or three people in the car. Interviewer: Any food Š no food at all? Irving Hass: We didn™t get any food. Interviewer: Toilet facilities Š nothing? Irving Hass: No toilet facilities. Even the windows were with – with wires. Interviewer: So it was dark insi de? Irving Hass: Dark inside, we had no light. When all of the sun , you™ re getting up , but the people Š the men mostly Š my father i s – was right by the window Š see what ™s going on. And I was right next to him; staying to –. He – he was lucky; when he got in, he got to a window. And b y the window he was seeing what™s going on , and he was telling us. He says: We are – He figured it out right away Š we™re in Poland. He recognized the Poland because the train had t o stop to water up the engines. And he saw these – these things, you know. ‚Cause I couldn™t see anything, you know. Dare and I begged to – I like d to see it ; he couldn™t even lift me up. And try to go three, four days in a car; we have no light, and you don™t – you can™t see what™s going down outsi de. My father could – could see in the windows, and the other people could see in the windows. And then we were so glad when we opened up the car in Auschwitz Š oh my God. And they told us that time: Oh you™re going to go – Š Arbeit Mach t Frei, they have a ll these signs in Auschwitz. Interviewer: What™s the first thing you saw when they opened the car? 36 Irving Hass: Germans Š lined up. And s ome other cars were unloaded already. And o ur car got unloaded; ther e was five or ten cars in front. People Š oh my God Š holding their children on their hand. And – and they were with whips and sticks Š you name it. You kno w to – to get a sample, each rail road car had to be in the right – right assemble in the front of the car; and then they were marching them off right t o the camp through the gates. Interviewer: As you got out of the car, your family stayed together? Irving Hass: Mine daughter – mine Š I say, my sisters would not leave the mother. That™s why not one survived. You see, if they would™ve separated from their mother to be individual, you know, they would probably have the whip to go to the left too, because the – the kid looked real good, you know, not undernourished Š my sisters, you know. And they would go; but the other girls – M y sister™s friend which gave me the other picture, she said : I separate from my mother. They put me a way when they unloaded me in the car. I didn™t know where my mother was. And m y sisters all sti ck to the mother. They holding hands when they got off the railroad car. Interviewer: All of them walking? Nobody being carried? The little girl walking? Irving Hass: Everyone. They not allowed to carry anything. The little one even walked. And the last time I saw my family, un – we unloaded. And I can™t forget it ‚til this date . The unloading of Auschwitz Š that™s the last day I saw my family. Interviewer: Your father Š was he still with your mother? Irving Hass: M y father with my mother , together with the five sisters. Interviewer: So they were all sent together? Irving Hass: All sent togeth er. And I know for a fact, they we re burned the same week or the same day when they arrived. Because my sister would ™ve been survived if they would be separated. My sister was an aggressive girl Š the big one, S heindel [sp, ph?] . Interviewer: Sheindel. Irving Hass: Yeah. She was an aggressive girl like that; I couldn™t believe it. When I met this – her friends in New York after liberation, I met one in New York, and one in – in – in Frankfurt , and they said: Maybe S heindel is alive. And I start, still corr esponding and finding from HIA S, Red Cross; and all of them, even a fter I was in the United States Š couldn™t find any. 37 Interviewer: So Sheindel is the most aggressive Š the strongest girl in your family? Irving Hass: The strongest girl from all of them, s he was a really aggressive. Loved the mother Š I™m telling you Š always, just like , you know, for mom and everything, you know. And she didn™t want to separate. And the kid did not know where they going; they want to be together as a family. Interviewer: How would you describe the other girls? Irving Hass: The other girls we re the same , but they ™re not so more attached, because , you know, she is the – she was the leader. The othe r was – the othe r one was a follower. Interviewer: So the other girls were f oll owing Sheindel? Irving Hass: Following what Sheindel Š what she was doing. Whatever Sheindel was saying , the other kids were following Š the other sister s. And they really Š because I™m – I™m just saying Š they were like a teacher, the big one. In – in home, they were al ways listening to Š the – the sisters were listening to her. Interviewer: And as you got off the train, and you were walking and then getting separated, did anybody have any idea what was go nna happen? What did you think was gonna happen? Irving Hass: I didn™t even know it was an oven. I didn™t even know what Auschwitz was. Like I said before, they put me in a barrack in wooden shelves. That™s – that™s what we were sleeping Š no mattress, no nothing. And the same clothes which I had as I cam e. Two days went by, and nothing happened. When I saw these people lined up outside, they were ready to go and to tattoo you. When I saw these people lined up, I ge t out of the barrack, and somebody didn™t see me. I crawled out and formed in a line. People stay in line and f alled in, and – and here the y took us to a railroad ; and I™m on a railroad car. My God, I sa ys: Where we going? Interviewer: You didn™t know. Irving Hass: I™m out of Auschwitz. That™s the onlyŠ Interviewer: You knew that Auschwitz was a place to leave. Irving Hass: I didn™t know wha t is going on in Auschwitz, but I see the people Š pushcarts, and walking, Interviewer: You didn™t want to stay. 38 Irving Hass: And I didn™t want to stay. And I don™t know what got into me. Th ere time, somebody came in and pushed me get out of that barracks and hang on to the transport. I was going right there and standing in the line; and there is all the counting. And the guy counts and says , March . And a ll of a sudden we start walking; we walk to a railroad. And we were – we loaded in railroad cars again and here in two days – [Interviewer and Irving Hass talking over each other.] Interviewer: Same kind – same kind of cars? Irving Hass: Same kind – same kind of railroad cars , and I™m going wind up in – in that camp. Interviewer: Theresienstadt? Irving Hass: Theresienstadt. Interviewer: And when you got there, what was your impression? Irving Hass: When I got t here, then I saw Š at least I know they™re not going to kill us. They unloaded us, and they gave us some bread. And they gave us – Interviewer: Germans? Irving Hass: The Germans – some kind of a Š what you call it Š soup from – made from Š cabbage soup. And I see somebody – we going to be somebody there, because they put us in clothes. They gave us the striped suits. I didn ™t have a striped suits in – in – in – in there. Interviewer: In Auschwitz. Irving Hass: In Auschwitz. Interviewer: So you didn™t get y our striped suit until you – Irving Hass: Until I ge t into Theresienstadt. Interviewer: Until you get i nto Theresienstadt. Irving Hass: That™s what I™m saying . Today™s date, I cannot get away thinking what pushed me to get into that line. People w as telling me that they™re in Auschwitz, they got into a line because they were tattooed and to go awa y. I was n ot tattooed, I was – Interviewer: Were you showered? Were you – your hair wasn™t cut Š nothing? 39 Irving Hass: Nothing was cut, and I was out from Auschwitz by – by sheer luck; to get into – All of the people there had tattoos and everything because I met them . They says : What™s your number? I didn™t want to say it. Interviewer: Do you know what just occurred to me? What you said about your sister being aggressive and strong and a leader , was true of you. Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: So, if you didn™t have a younger brother to follow you; but you were aggressive. Irving Hass: Yes, I was aggressive. Interviewer: You seized the initiative. Irving Hass: I – I was aggressive. Interviewer: You got on that line. Irving Hass; I was aggressive in stealing from – f rom – from under the wires; I went out at night. I could have been shot and killed to steal potatoes because I kn ow where the potatoes are during the day. I passed by, and they had the potatoes; and I came back in the barracks and shared it with my friend. I stole three potatoes and came, and we didn™t have too much big pockets. And I bring into the barracks, and then we were eating raw potatoes ; and i t was like sugar. Interviewer: Do you ever wonder why you w ere aggressive , considering Š I remember now Š the story you told me? When you were a student, and you were afraid tha t your father was gonna punish you for being a bad student; now, then you we ren™t aggressive. Right? Irving Hass: That™s right, that™s right. Interviewer: The change occurs. Does it oc cur during this trip? You had never been aggressive before? Irving Hass: Yes. It™s – it™s – it™s – it™s w hen I was already in Theresienst adt and that™s the time – Interviewer: When you were alone? Irving Hass: Alone – I was figuring – I didn™t – afraid for myself for that. I was not afraid for death. I was afraid , and this guy who was next to me, h e says : Don™t do this . He says : We are good friends; you gonna get killed. He says: Why should I get killed with – with – the guy ™s going to kill yo u with the sti ck or something, or 40 with a gun? I want to see a full stomach. And I took chances, and everything was luck with me. Interviewer: Well, you could die without food too. Irving Hass: And I tell you , say and that was more luck when they took us out and shot – shot us out there. And then when I saw the American troops were parading the Germans in trucks to go and pick up these people; they took you, people go pick ‚em up , and they couldn™t get over Š t he Germans Š how many Jewish people were killed in that forest . We had to bring them down; they packed them like sardines. And I – to this day, when I was liberated, wher ever, I saw these trucks coming with these people on, and I said to myself, you know. And – and I could tell you Š to live when I was marching in Flossenbürg and so on, they were marching us. I wanted to drink water, and it was wet from the trucks, from the tires going there ; and there is water assembled. I didn™t care if I die d or –. I grab my fingers and grab water and drank. Interviewer: From the puddle? Irving Hass: From the puddle. And y ou know something; you learn something here from doctors. You could survive days if you have to have liquid in you. Interviewer: You need to have liquid. Irving Hass: You need to have liquid in you. Interviewer: That™s right. Irving Hass: And that liquid Š I was telling this in New York to a doctor when I was going, after when I came here. In – i n New York when I came here, I was suffering from ulcers. And I couldn™t sleep , and it was ruining my stomach. And I went to doctors. They couldn™t help me ‚ til one guy came and tells me, he says : This is the doctor you go to 5 – 50 – 555 ½ Š and what is the Š Park Avenue, Dr. Katz. He™ s the only doct or. He was taken that time Š in ‚49, in ™50 Š very high, expensive, you know. He™s a big guy. So t he minute I sign in there is a nurse and another doctor, and he was telling me : What a re you doing here? This is only for rich people Š the president of Rippoli [sp, ph?] Š he has ulcer, he™s worried for his business. What are you doing here? The doctor said that. T akes me in and – and talks to me. And these doctors we re giving me all kind of things Š to medicine Š and it didn™t help. Oh Go d, I™m almost – H e says: Yo u give the nurse – In the Sam [sp. ph?] [ Note could be SamA] where I work in the textile, let me go to the doctors whenever; never docked me a nickel. He said to me: 41 Ulcers are getting from worr ied . You have no money, what are you worried about? I says, I told him about from where I came ; he says: You give the nurse a dollar; whatever you can . You go out. He gave me more time tha n the guys who paid him $500, this Doctor Katz. And he said: You know, we found out, you don™t have ulcers. I still have the paper in a box. Interviewer: What did you have? Irving Hass: He says : You got a nervous stomach, which when you eat it, it does not digest. Five doctors didn™t find out. And y ou go to a specialist , and the guy very expensive. And he says; he give me an example : You eat a pickle, a pickle is very hard to digest. I met my wife, I couldn™t eat cream cheese and jelly , and chicken; you ask her. All these years I went with her, until this Dr. Katz gave me a certain diet and gave me medicine to eat up . He says : And the stomach will eat food to digest, the chemicals , and it becomes energy or whatever. He says : That lays in your stomach and doesn™t digest in system. He gave me these pills , and all of a sudden I feel better. A month later he says : Oh Go d, you all right? And I come back; he says: You follow this. And then a month later I go back , and he says : Now, I said to him, we gonna have a good pastrami sandwich. And I –. She says : God, you™re gonna get sick again. [There™s a sound as if knocking on wood three times.] Never got sick – Interviewer: Ever again. Irving Hass: And that Dr. Katz found out what happened to me. And I went back , and I said: I™m Doctor – whatever you wish yourself, I double it for you, but you help me. And – and t hat guy helped me ; 50 – 955 ½ [ Note probably means 555 ½ as above] is the address on Fifth Avenue. And that guy found out the problems. Three or four doctors from organization send me in the hospital. They th ought I got ulcers or something. This – give you [unintelligible] – didn™t help. You go to a spe –. H e really, and he gave me tests Š drinking hot water, drinking this, and he came in and he says: You have no ulcers. That ™s good news, and he right away prescribed it. And h e gave me this booklet; a booklet he gave me. And I still got it; she saved it in a box. Since – t his and I still got – and – and he took it away. And today™s date, [There™s a sound as if knocking on wood twice .] knock on wood; all these years. Interviewer: You spent a few months in Flossenbürg? Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: You lived right inside the camp. What was it like? 42 Irv ing Ha ss: Flossenbürg was segregated Š wouldn™t Š no Flossenbürg, I think, wa s also a camp that gassed people. And they had people in different barracks Š for working. And I could tell you like I was an aggressive. I was hungry in Flossenbürg, and the garbage cans were standing idle. I went to the garbage cans and picked up food and ate. Wherever I can, I – I – I – I did. I s always – I was for survival. Interviewer: Who was in your barrack s? What kind of people were in there? Irving Hass: People were – That™s w hat I say; I met people from all over. Interviewer: All over. Irving Hass: All over; I did not meet in Flossenbürg – one member I met from my town is about six months later. He was in another barrack, and all of a sudden [? Somewhat unintelligible] I saw; and we were working together. He says: Where are you? And he told me and what – Interviewer: What was a typical day like? Irving Hass: They woke us up six o™clock in the morning, and they work from six right away Š no matter roll call [? Somewhat unintell igible], to heat, to rain, shine. And we worked ‚til about six o™clock. Interviewer: In the evening. Any meals? Irving Hass: They gave us one – one meal there at work which is other like you say – They gave us that soup Š was like gold to us Š cabbage sou p – cabbage soup. Interviewer: Cabbage soup. Irving Hass: They put this cabbage, and they – they cooked it in water; and – and that™s what we ate. And it was delicious Š I tell you. When you™re hungry, you eat it like everything. But – but when I was in the work, I was always obeying the orders Š I should not get in trouble. I could not – one fellow who was work with me Š he was, I think, from Poland Š and I said : Listen, hold on to me, when we were marching. He said : I cannot march no more; that™s it. And that™s all I hear, poof. Everybody in the transport we were marching; they couldn™t walk further, they killed you. And somebody picked ‚em up. And I begged him: Hold on, let™s go. And I – and – and he says: I can™t do it no more. And I did whatever, you know, to get to survive. And that™s one thing Š my survival was the – was the – 43 Tape Two , Side A Interviewer: Okay; w e were talking about – Irving Hass: Flossenbürg. Interviewer: Flossenbürg and a – and a typical day. And I think you were talking about the kapo. Irving Hass : Yeah, the kapo s; and another thing, too. Some of the kapos, which really bugged me in Flossenbürg, was also one of ours. Interviewer: One of your k apos was – ? Irvi ng Hass: One of our own people. Interviewer: From Ruscova? Irving Hass: From –. No, Poland. Interviewer: Polish Š Jewish you mean. Irving Hass: Polish Jews was always on the kapo. And I couldn™t get over one of our own – and our – one of our own would hit us. And t he reason Š he prob ably ge t preference treatment from the Nazis. Interviewer: So your – your kapo was a Polish Jew? Or was – Irving Hass: Not m ine. Interviewer: No, nearby. Irving Hass: Near the other labor – labor kommandos was – was – was – B ecause when I find out, and t he guys were talking : You see this guy, he says we gonna beat him up or something. Okay, but it happens. But I – my kapo was a Ukrain e. Interviewer: Ukrainian kapo. Irving H ass: And he was worse than ever. Interviewer: Uh huh. Irving Hass: And I tell you something , when I was reading with the Ukrainian, it really bugs me too , you know. And a lot of ‚ em was mostly collaborated with the Nazis , just complete. They were wearing these black uniforms. Interviewer: The kapo ? 44 Irving Hass: The kapos, you know; they got black uniforms Š where the – where the Ger mans gave them. I don™t know what kind, special made for this camp. You recognize right away that he™s one of – . And w herever they – they were going with Germans, he and – and the Germans were with us together. Interviewer: Were you ever punished for any thing? Irving Hass: The only thing I was punished – is – was to stay in the cold for an hour and a half. And I thought I™m not going to live through that. In Flossenbürg , they mad e me stay wit h – with a pair of – the pajamas and sandals Š stand for four ho urs. And I thought I™m not gonna make it ; but I said to myself, I am gonna make it, and I™m gonna make it, I ™m gonna make it. To myself Š really just talking by myself. And the reason for this happened Š he caught me with the – with the – not caught me ste aling. He caught in my pocket, a potato , and he asked me where did I get it. I says : I found it. And I [ Note probably means ‚he™] says: Where did you get it? I says : I found it. Now w here did I find a potato Š he has to find it on the floor. I didn™t; which is how he caught me. Whe re did you find this potato? That really – he first gave me a couple ‚sss™ – [ Note this is a sort of hissing sound.] with the sticks, you know. And then he says : Stay out there. Tomorrow morning you ™re going to stay ; and that™s wh at it will Š my punishment. Interviewer: What time of the year was this? Irving Hass: And t hat wasn™t Š I would say, time of the year, I would say, was close to maybe February, March. Interviewer: February, 1945? Irving Hass: February of 1945. Interviewer: So i t was winter? Irving Hass: And t hat was cold , and I™m telling you it was cold. Interviewer: Did y ou have newspapers under your clothing at that time? Irving Hass: At that time I didn™t , because he grabbed me right away out. I always was telling my – my – my – my friends to g et yourself away from cold . Wherever they find – wherever they find a paper, wrap yourself around the paper. I don™t know whe re – where – where it came to me Š on my own mind. I tried it once, and the paper kept me warm. People were shivering. Interviewe r: This was after – ? 45 Irving Hass: This w as after, yeah. People were shivering, and t hat paper was really like – something in me. Interviewer: Did he – did you ever see him punish other people? Irving Hass: Yeah, yeah, yeah [? Slight ly unintelligible] . He was – he was – If a guy goes in sick or –. And I used to tell the guys, I says: Don™t you –. He – t hey can™t go on over to work ; the guy™s in pain . Like he™s saying, he calls in sick Š not calls in [unintelligible] , he says to the gu y: I can ™t go Š he sits down. They take him in the – in the – in the hospital; whatever they had. He used to Š next time, we don™t know where he is; never know where he is. Wh at they did to him? Interviewer: Did you see any executions? Irving Hass: Uh-huh. Hanging I saw a lot. In – in – in Theresienstadt, they always wanted to show what will happen. And they – they lined us up in – in hanging Š about five or six of ‚ em at one ti me Š hanging. Shoo – to shoot with a gun was an easy killing Š which I saw quite a few of ‚em. And then they had a lu ll [? unintelligible] in the carts. In Theresienstadt I was also in a k ommando with carts to – with frozen bodies. I handled the frozen bodies and helped them with the three of us. And used to bring them to a place and throw them into – into a ditch. They have dug a ditch , but –. Interviewer: What did a person have to do to get hang ed in Theresienstadt? What was their crime? Irving Hass: He tried to run away or not to go – not to work. He ru n away , and they caught him, O K. I f they caught him, they bring him back , and they right away made –. Quite a l ot of people wanted to escape; and this one thing Š I did not want to escape. And I don™t know what happened to me. The only thing that™s absent [? unintelligible] from Ausc hwitz, I was going on transport; whenever I went to camp, I was not ready to escape; ‚cause I knew when you escape, they gonna get caught. You cannot be hidden. Interviewer: Well, where you gonna go? Irving Hass: Go. And another thing in the transport, the – the – the bombers used to go on over and over. And y ou see the dive bombers, diving against us. And we got s ome of us in the transport; they didn™t know who we were and got killed. Interviewer: So, some American planes bombed your transport? 46 Irving Hass: They didn™t know – they didn™t know who it was; and by accident. B ut what it got m e Š all the – the thing after the war I heard – no American bombers Š they knowed the intelligence Š couldn™t bomb Auschwitz. They would have saved millions; it would have – so maybe a million Jews would have been killed, whoever was in Auschwitz. And they could have bombed it and destroyed the railroads. And t he railroad tracks were never destroyed. Interviewer: Was Flossenbürg ever bombed? Irving Hass: Flossenbürg was bombed during the minutes what you call the – during the end of the war w hen we already in the forest Š they bombed it. But they didn™t bomb it completely. They bombed it before the tracks. Interviewer: Because of the military action going by , nearby – Irving Ha ss: The military; y ou see, the military was already going . And t he Germans were already given up. Like I said Š they shot us there and started escaping. I know the Third Army was the one who liberated – liberated me. And then a few days later, the war ende d. I think it was almost the end of April when I was liberated, and I was in the hospital. And then April, May – May something, May 8, I think, the war ended . Interviewer: Yes, yes. Irving Hass: Which I was in the hospital; and I found out the war ended. Interviewer: May seems to be a big month in your life. Irving Hass: May is a good month in my life because I was born in May. May, I was the last – I was caught in – in the – in the transport there. Interviewer: Yeah; but i t™s also the month you went to A uschwitz. Irvin g Hass: Yes, and I – I – I™m telling you it™s Taurus they call it , and that™s something. Interviewer: You™re a Taurus? Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: Now , at Flossenbürg, we were talking about executions. Did you see hangings at Flossenbürg? Irving Hass: Yes. Interviewer: Any body you kno w? 47 Irving Hass: I didn™t know anybody what – what was hanged. So we kept Š I said there were two different sections in Flossenbürg . In Flossenbürg, I didn™t know why – why that was so sections. Q uite a camp Š there in Flossenbürg. And they had different type of labor set-up. Some of ‚ em were working in factories , and some of ‚ em were working on the roads and special projects. Interviewer: When you saw these executions, and you saw those people dying, did you think they were lucky, or they were unlucky? Irving Hass: Sometimes I think that they were lucky. When I was – I feeling downgraded, like I was so col d and hungry, I said: I wish I would be on the hanging list. And then in my mind came that , Oh no, i t™s no t gonna go on forever; you gonna survive. And t hat ™s one thing – t wo – two things came to my mind Š I – I wished I would be there, and then I thought to myself : Oh no, I™m gonna survive . And I did survive. The mostly lucky day when I survived is that shoot ing in that forest. And to that day ™s day, I cannot forget. Interviewer: Saved by a tree? Irving Hass: Saved by a tree , and then to have typhus Š people die of typhus Š and survived. And when I was telling this to people, they couldn™t believe that I had typhus in 1945 and survived because Sch wandorf there was a close hospital there. And a lucky soldier caught me , and get me to the hospital. I don™t even know today ™s date who it was. Interviewer: Looking back Š all this Š what was your worst moment? Irving Hass: The worst moment is always thinking to myself, and thinking, it says : Why did this happen? There is no God. I said : I don™t believe in any God, to myself. How can this be, to human beings to be like animals? We™re catt le in the cattle cars , and that™ s all I was thinking to myself; always thinking . And I says : If I ever survive , I said to myself, If I ever survive, I wan na make sure that this™ ll never happen again ; and with everything I could do. And t his came out , and I bring it up in the army. I was drafted in the United States Army. I was transferred from Camp Gordon, Georgia to Camp Meade in Maryland, in Washington. We were working in a highly classified complex. And ther e was a – a Sergeant Willingham Š very anti -Semitic Š okay. And t here was a Jew ish holiday. The Jewish holiday came out from a Colonel Tullis Š was his name. All Jewish personnel are accused for the Yom Kippur holiday. Interviewer: Ex – Excused. 48 Irving Hass: I mean excused – for the Yom Kippur holiday to go to pre serve the holidays. So I didn™t know there w as two other Jews. All of a sudden I find two other Jews, one guy from Califo rnia and one guy from New York. One guy was Levin and one guy was Morris [sp, ph?]. Typewriter Š they had a typewriter company. Sergeant Willingham comes out and says : Okay you Dutchman , to me, you are gonna work your butts off over the weekend to clean the warehouse. Entire window Š which is a quarter of a mile long with windows in washing. We reported , and we cleaned the windows. And this guy Morris says to me: I™m gonna get a box of nails. I™m gonna put his tires; I™m gonna fix him up. I said : Morris, you™re not gonna put a nail so long as I am here. I am going to the colonel; tell him what happened. He wrote the orders, you know; shows you . And when I was telling this to my wife, I go to the sergeant; I says: I want to speak to the colonel. No, you go to the captain. I go to the captain, I says : Captain, I want to speak to the colonel. Can I help you? I says : Capta in, I™m sorry; this is the colonel™s probl em. The chain of command I went. He had to – to let me go. The captain tells me; he says : Irving – Hass , he called me, get yourself nice dressed -up. Make , sure your ties are right and – and you™re authorized to see the colonel. The colonel was told I ™m coming ; I™m coming in the office and salute; and says to th e colonel : Colonel, I got a personal problem. Mine frien ds did not have the guts to come to see you. And I tell him: Colonel, I am a survivor of the concentration camp. I was drafted in this United S tates Army , which is a nice country, and I love it, and I would die for it. What™s the problem? I say s: Colonel, here is your order. I had a copy of it. You see, I™m from the Jewish faith. You gave us permission to be excused from service – from the servic e company to go observe the Yom Kippur holiday which is a big holiday. He says: Oh yes, I know Yom Kippur. Sergeant Willingham, the following week, made me and my other two friends work in the warehouse cleaning windows for Sundays and Saturdays, two days, because of this. However, Colonel, my Jewish friends did wanna put nails under his tire and everything to get even with him. I said no; this got to be in the higher-up. That™s all you have to do. The colonel says to: relax soldier and I™m gonna tell you a story , he says to me. You sitting like this now, all relaxed. There is big fish in the ocean – small fish. Sometimes the big fish eats up the small fish. There is apples, beautiful apples in a basket. One apple in the middle all of a sudden is rotten . And this rotten basket touch es the other; the apple gets rotten. In this man™s army, he said, there is good people, and there is bad people. Here we got a rotten apple. And h e tells me: Soldier, I™ll take care of that. Soldier, he said to me, from now on, whatever happen to you, don™t go to the lower echelon; higher you go, action you get. You know what I™m saying? 49 Interviewer: Yeah, of course. Irving Hass: He says don™t – always go to the top. And h e – he shook my hand s, and he says : I™ll take care of it. He says: Thank God. Then looks at my file; he says : Soldier, you got an excellent record , to me. Basic training s in the sch ooling, you know, and everything, he says, excellent. I came back in the office. Morris is sitting there , and the other guy says : Don™ t you ever pick up the phone when it™s ringing now. You™re gonna hear a ring pretty soon. The phone rings; Sergeant Willingham answers it: Yes sir , yes sir, yes sir. He – the Korean War was on. He put him on a levy. Know what the colonel did? Sergeant, you ™re gonna be transferred on a – on a ship, and you™re going to Korea. Willingham comes out , and he™s in a transfer ; sees me. And he know Š the co lonel told him. See this little guy ? he said . This little guy had the guts to come to see me, the colonel told to the sergeant. He went through hell in Europe; lost his father and mother and sisters. And he had the guts to come and see me; and what you guys did. And I – he did not Š did he obey you? He says: Sure . The sergeant says : He obeyed your orders – my order s. So we obeyed. I says : One thing, we gonna wash the windows, he told us Š we gonna wash the windows. And t hat colonel gave me power in my mind. And I was telling this to my daughter too. When she was going to college, she has a problem in college Š you go to the dean. You don™t talk to the little peon. If you have a problem, you go to the top; and he took c are of it. And t hese two guys couldn™t get over , he said : Well I did . I says : Don™t answer the phone, let him answer the phone. And he got out of the – the – the thing. And that colonel, he says: You know what I am? He says : I™m a Catholic Š the colonel. And – and I know this should not happen in this mine – my man™s army, he said to me. And I say s: Colonel, I never refuse anything. When I was alive [?], the – the ser geant picks out people from my whole kommando Š you go on a KP. He comes to me: Hey you™re going on KP. And all of a sudden, all the guys want ed to stand the back of the row; you know, the guards can™t see Š maybe he doesn™t pick ‚em. I did KP once, and I worked for about 14 hours; t hat was my last KP. The sergean t never picked me again. I ask him: Sergeant why don™t you pick me? He says : You know why ? You were never squawk ed Š to me. I pick a guy, he says , with bi – bi – bitching – h e says: I did it, you know, and so on. I never squawk ed; I list ened to him, and I meant it . He never picked me on KP aga in. I could stand in front line Š and everything. And I – and I sai d the same thing to – to obey. And t hat™s one, my philosophy. And th en whe n I start coming a life to go to work, and I sat in the civilian life when I was workin g here . I came out of the army. I™m not gonna go back to the 50 textile because I saw I have no future. I went to school to learn to read drawings, you know, blueprints. Th ere was an answer in the – in an ad from a company in Bu nsen [sp, ph?] Road in New York. That was the company; they were making a system for the Boeing [?] Company. They were architects and making dams and making shelters for weapons. The guy interviews me and says okay Š I get the job. I go into work, and I get the – work with a guy Š Supervisor – Zosen [sp, ph?] was his name. He like s me, and all of a sudden gives me responsibility. We bec ome a subcontractor to AMF whi ch used to be American Machine and Foundry Company, and they were in Brooklyn and Connecticut. And t hey assigned me to work with AMF project, and I speak to the AMF guys and so on. And t he AMF guy says how would you like to work for the AMF? I says I don™t mind, if – if so long it™s in Brooklyn. They send me from Bunsen Road to a Canadian company and a job Š to get some informat ion for the Boeing Company. I™m in Canada , and I call up home Š my wife ; and my wife says to me: You g ot a telegram. I says : From where is it? From AMF ; they offered yo u a job. I says : How much? She tells me. I says: You write up a telegram, and say we will accept. I come – I – I call in Canada, call my boss from Canada and give him notice. I called the guy in Canada – from Canada to Bunsen and says : I™m leaving in two w eeks; I got another job. He sa ys: Where ? I sa ys: W ith AMF. I™m gonna work on the same project with you guys Š and I™m gonna be [? ] from the other side now. So I stay in Brooklyn and work about four weeks; t hey transfer the project to – to Greenwich, Con nec ticut. Here I come here, and I have a car, and it™s very far from Brooklyn to go to Greenwich, Connecticut. I go into personnel, and I says : Listen , I can™t do it. They says we g et you a car pool. Personnel goes through, and now I got Sheepshead Bay, a guy; I got one in Canarsie , I got that. We got a car pool; I didn™t quit my job. Work in Connecticut, and then AMF got a big contract with the Air Force, and I mak e really good points. I like the job, and they like me Š w as reading drawings, picking up specia l things from the drawings Š too ls, and so on Š which I had a ball. And I like d the company ‚til somebody, a relative, comes from Cleveland and offer s me a job in a furniture Š to be a salesman for him. And h e offer s me nice things and so on. And I live i n a little apartment in Brooklyn , and I said , okay, I™m gonna accept the job in Cleveland. I co me back and get to the girl ; I™m going to dictate you a memo. And I – I remember it from memory, the memo like this in my memory. And I says: I hereby tender my resignation from such a progressive company; not for the reason I do not like my job. I got a – a special offer in a different field , and I thank the – the company for the opportunity they gave me and so on. And I copy to personnel and a copy to the vice-president. And t he v ice-president the next day calls me up. He says : You know, your memo Š the – the 51 resignation; I never saw it with resignation like this. You know, I gave – I gave the truth. I liked the company ; I told the truth. He says: You know, you™ re not gonna quit. The vice -president tells me, says: You know, I™m not gonna let you go. I™m gonna mak e you a supervisor Š s tay. I come home and tell my wife . I says : Ann, he made me a supervisor, and h e gave me a raise ; and I stay. And I was going to AMF and working; I became really noticeable. And I don™t have a college ed ucation, everything on my own; and h ere was tec hnical. Okay, the supervisor had for ty people working already. All of a sudden, I – I™m buying a house in Fairfield, Conn ecticut Š by the college. AMF got more and more jobs. And all of a sudden they got a job on the Titan Weapon System , and they pick me t o go to Santa Barbara Š relocating . I gave a deposit, they building this house. I run right back, I says, stop. He says I could give you t he deposit back Š yes; t he company said if – you lose the deposit, we™ll – we ™ll pay for it. They transfer me to Santa Barbara, and we did not want to move. So I™m commuting from Brooklyn to Stamford, Conn ecticut ; from Gren – from Greenwich they moved me to Stam ford Š it™s another eight miles. Work and so on; and everything, you know, and AMF was involved Š my God Š bowling, you name it. You know, here were – here were all kind of – you know Š very big comp any. I got transferred from Brooklyn – from Stamfor d to York. And h ere is the transfer. One day the government has a plant, a N avy facility in York, Pennsylvania. You probably passed it on [ Note Route] 30, okay; it was not 30 then . And I got a package home Š so thick. The vicepresident says a letter , this is confidential; c ertain people were selected. You were selected to go to York, Pennsylvania to prepare a bid. You™re gonna check into this ho – hotel, and you™re gonna meet some other people. You are sell [?] – you section is to estimate logistics. You k now what a word Š logistics ? Interviewer: Sure. Irving Hass: Okay, y ou said estimate logistics; and do not tell a soul. ﬁ Oohﬂ – and St amford they say AMF is moving – nobody – ; leaks got out. The – the company says we™re not moving. I co me, and I did look o n the map; I never been in York. I chec k into the hotel, and I go through that facility ; I never believe it. Oh my God Š big; firing range, 360 acres! The plant is now Harley -Davidson. I make up the package; AMF is the lowest bidder – I mean the highest bi dder. Chrysler, General Motors, all of them bid for that. We were the highest bidder with 1.4 million. The contract was to get the plant plus 55 million continuation contract. We had to take over about 350 personnel, transfer red with the seniority and so on. My job is to read up because they had a logistic s department there. We were preparing logistic documentation, you know, for service of our lo gistics – 52 prepare ser – service equipment. And I co me back; the company announc e we™re moving. So they asking me what people would you like from your department to move. The company – t he vice -president asked me; I says I pick ed cer – certain people. In a matter of a month, two months, I was already transferred. For about eight weeks, I was commuting from York, Penn sylvania, that™s why I re member that highway to New York Š the Turnpike and so on. The company paid all the car expenses Š gas, mileage. Stay in York, Pennsylvania Š we build a house. A house for $21,000, which sells for $1 50,000 now; sold that time in ‚64. We – t hey – they moved three divisions, AMF did; Thomas Division, the Engineering D ivision , and the B uffalo Division. We moved on – we moved on 550 families. You don™t know what this town became. So much business came in from this move. And I was there Š ‚ til all of a sudden they transfer red me to a different project. One t he government phased out – how you gonna be in [?] the LPG projec t; which is liquid petroleum tanks for rural area homes. You know, they™re making this – the gas – enough for gas. And then from York, they transfer red me to Des Moines, Io wa. That™s what I say s I wind up in Des Moines. Then I was – in Des Moine s I was made assistant to the president, and the guy put me in to write procedures of everything under the sun, you know. And t hat guy was a – he – he developed the Head Ski; and he became from Head Ski . AMF bought Head Ski, and he became vice -president. And then he became – and he says : Irving I went through your folder, I want you to work for me. And y ou talk about people. He says: I like you. You call a spade a spade; and that™s what I™m doing. And m y office was outside the executive office , but you could bust a wall and – and close up the door, you wind up in the executive office. Bill Songs [sp, ph?], was his name, call s me in an d says , Irving, we™re gonna bust a wall , and we™re gonna share the secretary. He issues a memo to the vice -president of operation; t wo weeks go by Š nobody™s carpenters, no come, no no thing. He call s me in, and he says : Irving , [Note there is a loud slap] that door is gonna be busted tonight, and I guarantee you. The guys didn™t want – want me because, you know, there™s jealousy in the company goes around. He move me there next to him , and he assign me to the lawn and garden division which Sears makes mow ers. We mak e them for a private label. You know the – the smallest would cut gra ss Š you could see in my garage, I got all this private label. And I go through the logistics in Sears. And Sears – they buy a mower Š something is breaking; they send to the f actory to get a washer. The washer cost s 50 cents, and Sears sp – spends $3 – to – the paperwork and $4 to ship; they losing money. And I go into this job, and I say : Oh my gosh ; look it Š how many 53 orders are you getting from Sears? The guy says to me : Oh my God, we got 3,000 this month. And how much is the total? The 3,000 total about $12,000. I says: You crazy. I go out to Chicago, and I speak to the buyer, and I says : Listen, I™m gonna make an analysis and see what™s going on. In the meantime, I had a go od fellow working for me, and I says : Eph [sp, ph?] Jones – Eph – you™re gonna come with me to Chicago, and we™re gonna take all the data down. I told Sears that you guys are losing money; they – they pull their hair out. I prove it to them on charts. So h ere we ge t away with shipping no more from the factory. Sears had to ship it to a Philadelphia warehouse, and the warehouse is dealing with the – with the store. We were dealing with stores , you know, with – with the customer ; and I made a change on that. Another change come in. The – the boss got promoted; He takes over a – a bicycle division in Little Rock, Arkansas and a division in California. And comes in; he says : Irving , you™re going to Arkansas. To Arkansas? Not me! And I tell you , that™s where I wind up with my life in there . In all the time in my life, when my daughter used to see this, and I used to tell her: Go to the top, learn Š important things. And t hat™s why I always with the supervisors Š never. And I – I –. People kno w where you stay . We had in New York, a lieutenant general was – which is – was the Chairman of the Board™s buddy; he gave him a job. He wants to fish out who is a supervisor, who ™s not a supervisor. Fishing out, you know Š want s to know if he have the brains to be a supervisor. In one brain, he did, he came in nine o™clock with a package. He says to me: Your work are needed immediately. Nine -thirty he came s with another package. I need this in 30 minutes. Ten -thirty he came s in with another package; and here I got two packages I couldn™t say. I look at one package, he says with credit Š no. I look for another package Š is it a question some manual data Š no. The third package has to do, if I furnish this information , we will furnish you an order, you know, of so and so. I took the order package first Š he gave me the last Š to do the job. I finished it, he calls me in. He says : You see m, Hass , to me the general [?] . I gave this package, was to nine people. Everybody still working on package one. You got package three, which one I needed. Why – why did I get package three? I says : It™s more important because there – there™s gonna be an order from it. Package – the f irst is on credit, you know the guy™s waited so long for credit; he wait another ten days, i t™s not gonna hurt. And t hat™ s why the guy wanted to fish out; if you have authority. Then I used to go to seminars. At seminars, the guy was teaching the same thing. A -BC he says , assert yourself management seminars . He says assert yourself everything, A-BC. Interviewer: S o this is the kind of thinking – 54 [Interviewer and Irving Hass talking over each other] Irving Hass: This is the kind of thinking, and that™ s why I sur – Interviewer: – that helped you survive? Irving Hass: – survived in Auschwitz Š because of this. Right away, I don™t know what got in to me or something from my father. I could not stand. I was right away in that –; I – I thought to myself it™s gonna be better, whatever happens. Interviewer: What was on your father™s mind, as far as you can tell? Irving Hass: My father™s mind, he knew righ t away he™s gonna – he – this is gonna be of – of – of last. He said it in the railroad car. Interviewer: When you got in the car? Irving Hass: In the car, he says to his friend there, talking. He says : Binyamin [sp, ph?] – Interviewer: He fears the worst. Irving Hass: Binyamin, he said, what™s gonna happen? He called him and said : You know what™s gonna happen. I don™t trust the Germans. And h e knows that from the First War were the same thing Š they took us to Russia; and all of a sudden Š tell you Š some of them survived, some of them Š they were killed in the First War. And who my fath – father to wind up in Tashkent from – from Ruscova Š sent Tashkent; which is 4,000 miles or something. And – and he knew right away. Intervi ewer: So he thought you would all be killed? Irving Hass: He thought – Interviewer: – everybody would be killed. [Interviewer is talking over Irving.] Irving Hass: He thought we ™re all gonna be killed , and he says to me bef –Š in the railroad car Š one word I could never forget. Whatever happen to me, he says , don™t lose your religion Š to me Š whatever happen in the – in the camp. I said to myself: There™ s no God. I™m not gonna believe in God. Interviewer: This is when you were in the cattle car? Irving Hass: In the – in the cattle –. In the – yeah. 55 [Interviewer and Irving talking over each other.] Interviewer: When you questioned God™s existence? Irving Hass: Yeah, in the – in the concentration camp; not in the cattle car. Interviewer: T he cattle car yo u – Irving Hass: Was still – Interviewer: Y ou still believed in Go d? Irving Hass: Was still believed in God. But when I was in the camp, I said there™s no God. I – I don™t believe it. God cannot see people suffering no matter who you are , what religion; I s ays no. And then I saw, when after I got separated, I came to New York. I says listen , maybe God g ave this [?] because he punished us. And I™m back , and that™s what I tried to teach my children. Interviewer: So you did listen to your father in the end? Irving Hass: So I did listen; that™s what I™m saying. Did listen to my father , and my father said: No matter what you do, this is gonna bring you back to life. And I know I – I had bad days, and – and so metime I could™ve got killed Š with a car. We – we wer e almost, you know, terrible Š and I saw my father in front of me. Interviewer: So your father thought the Germans would kill everybody? Irving Hass He – he – I would say he knew this. He knew this in his heart. Because the First World War told him what – what happens Š i t™s a war . B ecause he knew America was involved ; and it ™s not gonna be easy to hold America, France , and England and so on. Interviewer: What about your mother? What did – [unintelligible] ? Irving Hass: My mother was not – not more like thi s. Like I said, my mother was a gentle lady, knows how to take care of the family , you know, and everything; but never knew politics or – or business type . Interviewer: But on this deportation in the train – to Auschwitz, what – [Interviewer and Irving ta lking over each other.] Irving Hass: In the deportation she was only crying. My mother was crying and everything . I says : I wish we were going to see it and everything, you know. And hugged me in the railroad car; oh my God, she must have hugged me hundred s of times. 56 Interviewer: She must have hugged all the kids. Irving Hass: Really I can™t ever forget. That ™s why I – I – when I see a movie , and I – told my wife, it™s about a concentration camp Š don™t watch it. I says : No, I™m gonna watch it, because that is in my heart. I got to Š nobody should forget. And t he Holocaust Memorial is the greatest thing we ever did. Interviewer: Could you get – ? You never had a chance to say goodbye to your sisters? Irving Hass: No. I just pulled away the guy, and that™s it. And I don™t – I™m saying from – my family, one would survive Š nobody – from my family . – [unintelligible]. And when I met my wife, she™s a – was an orphan; her mother died. And s he was in high school. And i t™s a – also a miracle I went up – to camp. In the camp, I – I got to there, two weeks they got free vacation for me Š from the organization. Lehman – the Governor Leh man donated a camp for orphans and so on, children Š nonsectari an, Jewish and non-Jewish. OK there™ s r eally – I met some nice people ou t th ere. And I – I – I checked in , and I saw this girl. The minute I saw her –. I didn™t have a steady – I mean a good-paying job Š didn™t have a thing. And I said to uncle and aunt, I says : I can™t marry, what am I going to do? He says : Don™t worry, marriage brings luck, whatever. And – s o I dropped her. Three weeks later, she called up and ask ed what happened. He didn™t – I didn™t call her. I says : You know, I – I cannot. And t hen I called her from then on. I just – I had a ri ng which I brought from Germa ny Š a little ring Š and I – gave it to her; I says : We™re engaged. And t hen my uncle and aunt, with the family , planned a wedding. And – I got married in – in Henington Hall in the East Side. And – and – and t hat™s why – that™s why now wh ich I read in the paper an d I see in television, people don™t say there is no – Holocaust. How can a person say which people come in today™s world; which I would only able to talk to him and show hi m a pic ture that I went through this? And I have seen this , and you tell me there is so in California pictures, there never was a Holocaust. Where is my town of 300 people? Maybe the entire town, maybe 12 or 14 survived. I don™t think we have twelve – from the entire town of 300 families. And this is an outrageous. And this Holocaust Memorial should be really built that should be stand for hundreds of years. I know the – the data what they – what you accumulate should be there for hundreds of years. Generations should come; generation, generation to follow. Interviewer: Let™s hop e so. Irving Hass: So I really – I really; it™s real ly bad. 57 Interviewer: Do you have anything else to say? Irving Hass: The only thing I can say, I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity. Interviewer : Thank you, I appreciate it , and I thank you. Irving Hass: And I – I really thank the organization. Whatever happens, I™m really happy. Interviewer: I thank you on behalf of the Holocaust Museum. Irving Hass: Thank you.
