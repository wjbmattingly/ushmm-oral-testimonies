I happen to go the same week to Basel because I have a sister there, and then I™m going to Zurich , so I can take you. So we thought it™s a good idea, because Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 34he told us that go Œ traveling to Switzerland, you have to go through Luxembourg and Œ and France, and we haven™t been there yet. So we said fine, we™ll go with you. And we went. We Œ til we came to si Œ to Canada , we traveled everywhere in ti Œ on the Israeli passport, oka y? So when you come to Luxembourg, then with the custom, that when you arrive on the border, the people from the Œ you know, they™re sitting in the hut, in a ho Œ little house? They come to the car, they take your passport, they check, they did what they do, and they br ing it back, and goodbye. So about five minutes Œ am I too fast? No. About five minutes later, they bring back the passport for Œ to Œ to the couple that are friends, and not our passport. And we sit, and we sit, I don™t know, maybe it was only five minutes, but to us it looked like half an hour [indecipherable] we didn™t know what™s going on. And we thought also that friend of ours, what were they saying? Maybe they are saying we are smuggling diamonds or something, becaus e why don™t they come back with the passport? Eventually Œ yeah , eventually somebody comes, one, walks around the car, looks in it as we were the back, look s, goes back. Another one comes, same thing, and a third worker. We didn™t know what™s going on, because eventually this one comes and gives us the passport to sa y thank you, you can go. Well, she said wait Œ wait a second. What happened here ? Why did it Œ what happened? Why did they come Œ it was in 1956, and this was when the Suez War was. And this is when Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 35the Suez War was. And this is when Israel was the first time on the map aft Œ you know, big, big because of Œ and they knew. And the first time in the life, they saw Œ Q: Saw Israeli Œ A2: Œ Israeli passports.

A2: Yeah, it was night, and it was pouring ra in, we couldn™t see in front of us. A: Raining [indecipherable] A2: Okay. So we decided to stop and stay the night, and we™ll continue the next day.

And Œ A: May I stop you? A2: Yeah. A: If I Œ if I get to say I had to get Œ A2: I didn™t forget Œ I didn™t forget the passport. Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 36A: Œ you forg Œ you forget to say I had to give Œ you forget to give Œ you had to give the passports Œ A2: Yeah, oh yeah. A: Œ and there was written Œ A2: No, no, no Œ A: Œ in English Œ A2: Yeah. A: Œ there was written Œ A2: No. A: Œ in French Œ A2: Yeah, yeah. A: Œ prime minister from Œ A2: No, no. A: Œ Prime Minister Kraus. A2: No, no Moshe, let me, sorry Œ A: Mr. Kraus, Prime Minister. A2: No Moshe , let me, please. It™s true Œ A: But it was my title, prime minister. Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 37A2: I™m Œ I™m coming to it, but you™re spoiling it. You™re spoiling the whole story. When we came in the hotel, okay, then was the customs also, you have to give a passport. And when you leave Œ Q: Yeah. A2: Œ they give it back to you. Q: Yeah. A2: Okay. I didn™t remember what™s written in the passport. And again, as Moshe mentioned to you, he was th e chief cantor of the city, and Œ and our passport was written all in French. So in French his title Œ A: I was city cantor. A2: Yes, you said that already Moshe . It was written, where they say the title, prime minister of [indecipherable]. This was his title. In French it me Œ you know, in Europe , a cantor and a rabbi is a minister, like in England, you know, so he was a minister premier, chief minister. Q: Oh, the chief minister. A2: Yeah. But seeing the chief minister, an Israeli passport, so if they s Œ so that man at the Œ at the desk, when he opene d the passport, he called right away the manager, said look, the Prime Minister of Israel is here. Yeah. Well, I didn™t know that. Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 38Q: You didn™t know that either. A2: No, no, we didn™t Œ we didn™t see [indecipherable] no, it didn™t occur to us Œ Q: That™s very cool. I like that story. A2: Yeah, well, so the three men start speaking, of course, in French, they apologize. They apologize, they apologize, apologize, and we didn™t know. If we would have known, this go vernment would have made a welcome party. We would invited the press, and Œ and we would have put the Œ and I am kvelling, you know, I think Œ thinking well he™s Œ he™s fame Œ I mean, I didn™t even know where we are, I didn™t even know if there are Jews there, so how do they know who ca Œ came Œ the famous Cantor Kraus is? But then they said, if we would know he is coming, we would have put the flag out. Wait a second, flag? What™s going on here? I Œ I really wasn™t that stupid, it was a semi-misunders tanding Œ misunderstanding. So Œ but to make sure, I said wait, and I called my [indecipherable] my French was, but not perfect, I said, I™m not understanding well, you know? So I Œ I went to next door, called my friends, and I hope they™re not u ndressed yet, yeah, and I asked them, see what™s happening. So this is what the story was, they thought he is the prime minister of Israel, and they wanted to Œ to Œ di-di-di Œ anyhow Œ Q: Should have said he™s better than the prime minister. Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 39A2: Wait. So, yeah, so this Œ they said okay. But in the morning, they will come to say goodbye, you know. Needless to say, we left, I don™t know, five in the morning, we ran away, you know, because we didn™t want to Œ to tell them that they™re Œ and you know, for I think weeks, we checked every Israeli pa ssport, to read Œ Israeli newspaper, sorry, to see if the Shin Bet is not looking for imposter, prime minister imposter. Because they don™t know the story, and if the [indecipherable] there was a prime minister Q: That™s great. It™s a very good story. A2: I think it™s a very funny story. Q: It™s a very good story. A2: Yeah, okay, th-this is one story. A: Why do you Œ don™t you finish off the story? What happened in Basel when we arrived? A2: It™s Œ it™s Œ no Œ yeah, Basel, okay, yeah. So, anyway Œ one way Œ on the way what Œ yeah, and Œ when we arrived in Basel first because he went to see sister. So, before he Œ and he said, we™ll wait, we™ll walk a little bit and he will come and pick us up, we will continue [indecipherable]. But before we left, he told us he Œ he and his wife were in the Œ in the zir Œ in Basel the whole we Œ the Œ the time of the war. The time of the war. They had survived. Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 40A: And everybody knows them. A2: No, wait a second. And he did Œ he couldn™t work, he didn™t have a work permit. So he was walking the street, in all the cafes, he was Œ didn™t know what to do, so he said, you know, everybody knows me. Fine. So as he™s telling that, a young man comes close, and Œ and Moshe says, here, ask this young Œ young man. Said, so, Mr. Boyavich(ph) Œ boyo Œ boyo Œ boyas Œ Boyavich (ph) Œ A: Boyovich (ph).

So they ask him Œ they gave him Haft orah. They didn™t always. Said Moshe Shapeer(ph). Yeah, I said, he™s a diamond merchant from Johannesburg , this is what he said. Because we knew, once they hear [indecipherable] sing something for us [indecipherable] because you know. So, this is how we Œ the way how we Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 74avoided it. So, but when he Œ when he said Haftorah, they saw in the Haftorah that™s Œ that™s unusual. His diction, first of all, is perfect, and his voice, even not singing, but reciting Œ so they looked at him. And I was Œ like this is what they wou Œ the ladies™ shul, I was standing in the door, because I wanted to see and hear, and I was the only lady there.

And then we really saw. We saw beautiful golden carriage, w ith horses, you know. We saw the shah and Mr. Brezhnev . And you know, the shah was dressed beautiful [indecipherable] with a suit and Œ and then the second carriage was Fra(ph) Diva(ph) and Mrs. Brezhnev.

And we were the only ones [indecipherable] of course, Israeli passport. So one day, the de sk calls us and they said, there™s a man come to see you. We didn™t know it Œ who it is. To make the story short, there was a man in Œ in Œ his name is Singer. Actually, he was an opera singer. And he remembered Moshe , they went to chayder together at home [indecipherable] Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 94together. When he heard the name, he knew who it is. So he came to see us. At that time a local person couldn™t come into hotel, the hotel was only for international visitors. You couldn™t walk in. And if you walked in, you had to leave his passport at the desk, and they had to chec k what it is, and report to the [indecipherable] and then he came to see Œ then he is allowed to come and see us. And of course that was emotional to Œ Moshe didn™t remember Œ you remembered him? You did remember? Anyhow Œ okay. And then he tells us a story like this, which is unbelievable story. He says he is marri ed, he has four children, one son, one daughter and twin Œ twin girls. And he re mained a Jew. He was also in the camp and survived, but he is still a Jew, in heart. And he knows that if he™ll stay with the chil Œ with the family in Œ in Prague, they will lose the children. They™ll become goyim. They will intermarry, because the Jewish life wasn™t as interested Œ as organized. I don™t know if they had the chie f rabbi there Œ they did Œ yeah, they did have a chief rabbi.

And then they started going Œ okay, so Œ so what do you want from us, children. Listen to this, I mean it sounds unbelievabl e, he said, I want you to take the children out. I leave them in Œ them in your hand, and you only have to promise me one thing, that you give Œ give them the be st Jewish education, they should remain Jews, that™s all I want. Can you believe? Q: Wow. A2: I mean, if Œ really, I mean, I Œ we have proof, because it stil Œ but otherwise people won™t believe a story like this, right? Q: And? A2: And wait. So Moshe said, I can™t promise you anyt hing at the moment. I™ll tra Œ I™ll see what I can do, and we™ll see. And Œ and wait. We didn™t leave yet, there™s another story. For when we were in Prague , Moshe got a call from Rabbi Rosen , chief rabbi from Bucharest. Q: Of course. And chief rabbi of Romania . A2: He has to go Œ yeah, yeah, he has to go back for this mission, for whatever, you know. So he gave me my Œ my passport, he gave me some money, and he left.

So Moshe left, and I remained in pra Œ in Prague alone. It was very unpleasant, it Œ to be in the hotel, it was all those Arabs, a woman alone, and they looked at me all the time, you know. This is not important. But this Mr. Singer, he was my connection. He is the only one I knew. And as it happened, it Œ is h Œ sho Œ told me where to go, to the opera, and the ballet and all that.

So this is one little episode about that. Okay, what can we tell them more about the trip behind the cu Œ Iron Curtain? Is there anything else? Oh yeah, in Prague, was true Œ true stor Œ yeah, yeah.

So Moshe brought this Singer to be the chazzan in the hall. But the Singer never was a chazzan, he was an opera singer. So we brought him a fa Œ I don™t know, a week or two earlier. And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him, learn si Œ he could read. He knew the dave ning, he was a Jewish Œ I told you a Jew, but he didn™t know the nusach, and chazzan is not just singing, it™s nusach. I don™t even know what I™m talking about, yeah? Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. A: And yeah, he taught him and he beca Œ became the chazzan in Œ so he brought him for about three years Œ Q: To Johannesburg. A: Œ to Johannesburg to be the chazzan, and he got Œ he could take the money out, because he was a foreigner, and he took it back to Œ to Œ to Prague, and they had money extra. Prague was very bad at that time, I Œ I™d have to tell you, because I remember I was asking the hotel if they have an orange.

So the chief rabbi said, first of all, what we have to do, we have to take out the family, because how can we take Œ because we Œ we can™t take children without family, it™s important. So what did we do? They made co Œ a fake Œ a fi Œ a fictional Œ fiction contract, is that fiction, no. Yeah? Q: Fictional, yeah. A2: Fictional contract with a certain Œ with a shul that the rabbi arranged. They invited this Mr. Singer to be a chazzan in the shul for three years. Q: In London ? A2: In London, and go to the government to show them the contract, and tell them we are going for three years, and why the Œ and they allowed him to take the whole family, why? Because in London they Œ they have Œ I don™ t have other city in the Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 103world, but London has an international school, ever y language. So they have also school for Czech. So the government allowed them in Œ in Œ in Œ on condition that he takes them to Œ the children to school , the Czech, yeah, and he had to leave everything behind.

South Africa didn™t have any connection with any Œ any diplomatic connection with those cun Œ any of the countries, communist countries then. So how Œ and how can you bring a family? I remember the public prosecutor in Johannesburg, Dr. Yuta (ph) was a great friend of ours, so Moshe went to tell him the story. Said I want to bring a family. They™re Jews, they™re not communists, I Œ I guarantee, and I want to bring them here. So, remember what Yuta(ph) told you? It ma Œ it made so he said, when here will grow Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 104hair, the government will allow a family to co Œ a communist country family to come to South Africa. This is what he told you, right? I remember that. But you don™t know Moshe, he doesn™t take no for an answer. He went to Pretoria Œ Pretoria the capital, yeah? Q: Yeah, yeah. A2: And he got in touch to the rabbi, Rabbi Katz , I remember, and he told him the story and he said, just make an appointme nt with the foreign minister, or I don™t know which minister had to do with th e Œ with the papers, and he made the appointment with him, and he came to him and he si Œ talked to him.

The food, I mean, mostly potatoes that time, there was much Œ not much to eat. But this is the only place we ate. When we went there for our meals, nobody will talk to us, because they saw Œ everybody was suspicious, thought we are spies, they don™t us, why should they talk to us? And even ther e, people didn™t talk anything personal, Interview with Moshe Kraus November 30, 2014 106because they were afraid of the shadow, that atmosphere then, unbelievable frightening. And Œ and also, by the wa y, when we went to Œ to the Œ Singer™s home, he took us to his home, they were all sitting with coats, because they didn™t even have heating.

Be cause we were on the way Œ way to Cuernavaca, he was supposed to give a concert, why in Cuernavaca ? It™s a la Œ I have to explain it.

So that people couldn™t find him, they didn™t know. They checked all the civil hospitals, no, couldn™t find him. And they couldn™t find him, they can™t do anything.
