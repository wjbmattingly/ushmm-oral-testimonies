BARBARA SYSKA October 22, 2014 Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mrs. Barbara Mikowychok-chuk (ph) Syska . I™ll repeat that. Mrs. Barbara Mikowychuk(ph) Syska , on October 22nd, 2014, here at the Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C. And I™d like to start out by thanking you very much to come to speak with us today. I appreciate the time that you™re going to take, and the experiences that you™re going to share. As I explained a little earlier, we start our interviews from the very beginning. We™d like to learn a little bit about your prewar life, your family, the world you were born into, and so on. So I™ll start with the very basic questions. Could you tell me the date you were born, your name at birth, and where you were born? Answer: I was born in Biaystok, 20 Œ May 24, ™27. My name is Barbara Joanna(ph) sys Œ sorry, Mikowychuk(ph) Syska , by my husband. Q: So that means your maiden name was Mikowychuk(ph)? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And you were born in Biaystok? A: Yes, in the city Œ in the hospital there. Q: Ah. Can you tell us Œ because some people will know what that is and where that is, others will not know. Can you tell us a little bit about the city? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 4A: Biaystok was the center city for the county of Bia ostocka (ph) Voivoidsfa (ph). Voivoidsfa (ph) Bia ostotsky (ph), that™s come from Biaystok. There was one hospital at that time. I lived, for the firs t year, somewhere on the ci Œ in the city. And when I was a year, or a year and a half, we moved to the part close to Paac Branitsky, is Palace of Branitsky. Q: And where™s that? A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, so there was a fence between the one park and the other. One was the school, which was just ordinary school with the school for the teachers. The other was the ci-city of Biaystok where Œ where magistrat(ph) is. Q: Was municipal authorities? A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. A: And at that part there was also a big lake where we used to slide during the night Œ du-during the winter. Q: So it would be frozen over? A: Why we moved to that part, which was the school, because my mother was a teacher. Both of my parents has only education up to the matriculation. Q: What does that mean, matricul ation? High school, or some college? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 5A: Twelve. High school, high school. Q: High school. Gymnasium, and so, yeah. A: They didn™t have anything farther than that. So my mother was specialized in teaching the teachers, and because of that , she was teaching e-even in high school, the 10th and 11 th Œ well, 13 grade. At that time the teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade. Otherwise, she has only the right to teach up to the ninth Œ sixth grade, sorry. The school was divided six grades, four grades and two top, and then you have the high school. Q: So your mother was a teacher. Was your father also a teacher? A: No. He was the Œ they met in Wejherowa, it™s close to the sea. She was a teacher and he wanted to be the soldier. And she convinced him to leave the army. I have no idea what happened duri ng the war on 20 for my father. Q: In 1920. A: Because he Œ in 1920, he was 22. So most likely he was in the army. They never talk about that. The only thing my mother convince him to leave the army. And because he was in the army before, he was the army reserve. So from time to time he had to go and learn a bit more for a week or two. Otherwise, he was a clerk. A Œ most likely he was an accountant. I didn™t know much about it. Q: I see. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 6A: And we lived in the buildings close to the palace. Q: What™s a powets? What™s a powets? A: Palace. Q: Palace, okay. A: Mm-hm. The buildings were built Œ when I visit after the war, the walls were most likely close to a meter wide. So it was always warm, but of course for the restroom we would have to go Œ share it with two other families and go downstairs somewhere. There was no hot water, and th ings like that, because the building at that time was already 150 years old. Q: How was it that you lived in this palace? A: Because my mother was teaching in the school. So we Œ Q: And the school was located in the palace? A: Yes. Q: I see. Okay. A: Oh, part of it. Q: I see. I see. A: And in the Œ there was a beautiful park, there were tennis courts, which are very, very expensive, but I was not athletic. My brother, four years older than I am, was in tennis and swimming and everything. In Bia ystok there wasn™t Œ there was a Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 7river, but the river whose Œ which smells very, very badly, because Biaystok is a town of industry for clothing. Q: Textiles. A: And every Œ textile. And everything went into that river, and vo Œ very small river. It used to be called Biaka(ph). Right now they call it Biay Rzeka Œ Rzeka Biay, which means White River. It was really nothing, it was smelly always, not transparent, but no Œ nor Œ no animals, no nothing. Q: So it™s polluted. A: Enormously polluted. You can™t imagine. Q: Even before the war? A: Before the war. They were going to put it into underground. What they did afterwards, I don™t know. I visited Biaystok only once from this country, and it was completely different. Before the war, it was 104,000 people. And apparently half of the population was Jewish. I thought it only about a third. Part of the poorest part was Jewish, and they were all Œ also little shacks where they were selling every Œ food and everything, so we would go ther e. And I™m sure that it was completely burned while eur Œ when the Je wish people were fighting. Q: I see, so Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 8A: But I wasn™t there at that time. Why I say about my father and about the Œ his experience, because when the war started, he had to go to the army, and with his army, he was going back, back, back Œ Q: Wait, excuse me, I™m going to interrupt. We™ll come to that point. I™d like to leave the Œ the stories and the experiences about World War II to the side right now, and concentrate on Œ on what Œ what was life like pre-war. And I have a few questions already from what you were telling me, and they™re factual kinds of questions. A: One thing also. Q: Sure. A: My mother had a servant Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ who was taking care of me, and cooking, because she was a teacher. But she was paying a lot. It we Œ the servant lived with us, and she was paying 25 zoty. If you could somehow Œ I think that her mont hly was 200, or something like that, her moth Œ my mo ther™s. So Œ Q: Your monthly Œ your mothe r™s monthly salary was 200 zoty? A: I think so, but I am not sure. I k now that she was paying not 20, but 25 zoty to the servant. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 9Q: Per week or per month? A: For a month. For a month. Q: Okay. A: And most of the servants had very little education. For one, her daughter was somewhere, and I was writing the letter, which she was Œ so, she was completely Œ couldn™t say anything. Q: So she was not literate. A: Not Œ not at all. Q: So you would write letters for her to her daughter? A: Yes. Q: I see. A: And so, that I know. We lived in a convertible place. My father, my mother, my brother, four years older, I and the servant. Q: Can I in-interrupt right here then? Your brother Œ if you are born in 1927, yes? A: He was born in ™23. Q: In 1923, okay. And his name was what? A: Antonyen (ph). Q: Antonyen (ph) Mikowychuk(ph). A: Yes. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 10Q: And your mother™s name? A: She was from mai Œ her maiden name was Czynska (ph). Q: Czynska (ph). And her first name? A: Selena(ph). Q: Selena(ph). A: One name only. Q: All right. And your father? A: Antony (ph). Q: Antony (ph). Were they Œ you said your mother was from the city of Bia ystok , yes? A: No, no, no. Q: She was not? A: My father was from Warsaw, and my mother from Przemy l. Well, Warsaw is west of Biaystok, and Przemy l is south. And I can tell you this story of my family. Q: Oh please, please. A: That™s a most likely true story, completely. Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 11A: And the time is in 1683. Vienna was defending, and they ask king of Poland to Œ to c-come and rescue, and Vienna was defended. That was very important in the history of Europe . Q: You mean when there was the Ottoman Empire, or the Turkish [indecipherable] A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: Forces were Œ A: And at that time, the king w ould conduct a fight from the hill. Q: Yes. A: And once a day, he was standing on the top of the hill, and there was a Turk coming on his horse. And the bo y who was at the Œ we Œ th ey bring all the food and so on. Q: Who was bringing the food, I mean, I guess just the Œ a Œ a Œ a young boy who™s been Œ A: Young boy. And he saw that Turk coming, and he killed him. For that act Œ czyn in Polish, he was named Czynski (ph), and the king ga-gave him somewhere Œ right now it™s Ukraine, Humanya(ph). He gave him a big pla ce. And of course, he gave him Œ he was a nobleman, made a nobleman for that czyn. And he was Czynski (ph). My mother is Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 12Q: Czynska (ph). A: Œ ma Œ was Czynska (ph) from that. But the leet Œ that Œ that young boy was Jewish. And to be a nobleman he cannot be Jewish, he had to be Catholic. And because of that his mother Œ most likely they were poor. Q: Yeah. A: And he was given a lot of land and being a nobleman for always, and she didn™t like it, chan-changing her allegiance, no. So she curse him and Œ up to 11 th generation. I™m his 11 th gener-generation. So what Œ I have one in 2000 drop of Jewish blood. Q: Oh my goodness. A: But I really respect her, that being from poor to Œ and this is most likely completely true story. Q: Well, you know what is also interesting is that it is a story that was passed down through those 11 generations, to you. That is, it™s something that stayed within the family Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ as Œ as Œ as a story of how Œ so did your mother come from nobility? Could you say that she was born in Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 13A: Well, in Poland there is a custom that if a father had three sons or 10 sons, his property is divided equally, except if somebody goes to priesthood. Q: Okay. A: So they were pushing boys to priesthood so they would Œ and because of that, the noble people were sometimes have the piece of land just as m-much as the peasant. And the story, but I don™t know, it was mo Œ most likely my grandfather Œ Poland was taken by Russia and Œ and so on, three times. And once, my grandfather as a baby, was carried throug h the border in a wash basket. So Œ Q: From Russia into Œ A: Œ then they didn™t have Œ from Humanya(ph), which was Poland Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ and right now is Ukraine, middle of Ukraine somewhere. Q: I see. A: I always hoped to Œ to go th ere and see whether there are any Czynski (ph) there. Q: Yeah. A: But most likely not. I don™t know. But anyway, so they moved, and my mother was in Przemy l, somewhere connected with [indecipherable] . My grandfather died when she was one year old. Q: Oh. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 14A: And that™s also story in the family. She was the younger Œ youngest of four from second wife. Of course, the first one died, no Œ not di vorced. So she™s Œ for a woman, my mother was born 1898. So at that time, to bring up four children, so my father wish her Œ I wish that he Œ that that one will die for you. That was my mother. Well, three is easier than four. She managed somehow. Q: Yeah. A: She gave good education for Œ Q: All her daughters. A: Good Œ Q: Yeah, all her children. A: Yes, yes. And she was working with a nurse na Œ nurse, servant and nurse. They were cooking and giving lunches to peop le who were coming, that™s how she supported herself and four children. Q: So that™s your grandmother. A: That™s my grandmother. Q: What Œ what a story. A: Yes. Q: What a story. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 15A: So, we believe that wom Œ women are equal, but completely different. But we are equal. Q: Yeah. Well, you survived, and Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ and she brought up her children. A: Yes. So she was a teacher, and because of that we lived there. And she had a servant, she had to, but in comparison I ca n™t Œ did Œ I didn™t sa y how big was our Œ Q: Yeah, tell me. A: Œ apartment. Four of us and the servant, there were two rooms. One little room connected with two rooms, and kitchen, an d so they couldn™t be Œ that room could not be used for anything, only just storag e of Œ cupboard. And the servant sleeps in the kitchen. Q: Wow. A: When the Soviets expelled us, a man ca me in and my mother says, well, we™re here only, and [indecipherable] there no room. And he said, oh, in our country even Stalin doesn™t have such a good room. And he believed. Q: Yeah, he believed, yeah, yeah. A: He believed. But it was really very small, but that was cheaper than Œ because of Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 16Q: She taught Œ A: Œ it was only for teachers Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ so it was slightly cheaper, I don™t know how much it was. Q: So, I got the impression Œ tell us again, there will be people who know geographically where Biaystok is, and others who don™t. Can you tell us where in Poland the city is? A: It™s halfway from Warszawa to Œ you say Vilnius, I™m saying Wilno. Q: So it™s halfway between Warsaw and Wilno , and Wilno is in Lithuania , so that means it™s in eastern Poland. A: Yes, right now it™s very easter, but is part of Œ biggest part of Poland was taken by Soviet Union . Q: So that means that it™s in the northeastern part, so Œ A: Slightly north to the Warsaw, but it™s not very far. I think, if I™m right, it™s 110 kilometers. That means about 18 miles from Warsaw. And when my brother finished his middle school gymnasi um, four years, that™s the 10 th grade, he decided to go and visit my aunt, which was in Pruszków , which is very close to wa Œ Warsaw, and my grandparents were in Warsaw Œ on the bicycle. And he made it in Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 17one day, but the more Œ mo st thing difficult was the first part, because it was not paved. It was just a road. An d that™s the main road from Warsaw to Wilno. Q: Now, within Bia ystok , were the roads paved? A: They were something what we call koci bur (ph), cat™s heads. It™s a Œ Q: Cobblestones. A: Cobblestone. Q: Cobblestones, I see. A: Mostly, and there will Œ will be some which wer Œ weren™t paved at all. Q: Tell me a little bit about modernization. You mentioned that in this city there was Œ there were textile factories that were Œ that polluted. Did people have cars? Did they have radios? Ho w modern was a ci Œ was Biaystok as a city? A: A Œ one of the teachers, they didn™t have children, have a car. And we used to come and see how he was working with th e car. You have the handle in front Œ Q: Oh yeah. A: Œ and move it. Q: I see. A: And that™s how you start the Œ Q: The car, that kind. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 18A: Yes, that kind. So I saw the car, and I saw the first plane, it was the first few days of the war. I was coming Œ I™m somewhere close to that bieka(ph) and the plane flew over it, very close. That was the closest to the planes. Q: So that™s the first time you saw an airplane Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ was when the war starts. A: Yes, when the war st Œ Q: That means 1941, or 1939? A: ™39. Q: ™39. So Œ A: ™39. Q: Okay. A: My daughter had the plane to Œ she used to [indecipherable] the plane. She still have it, I think it doesn™t play. And my youngest son is a pilot since he was 17. He is in Poland right now. But I saw the first plane. Q: You saw the first one. A: Well, he™s ple Œ flying helicopters, but Œ Q: Yeah. A: So the war Œ the world change very much. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 19Q: Yes it has, hasn™t it? It really has. In Œ in Biaystok , what would Œ was it a pretty city, or was it a very, as you say, if it was industrial Œ A: I don™t know where industry was. I was close to Œ well, from us it was very close to Œ to the main market there. And I would go with the servan t to Œ when she was shopping in Hahnyehki (ph). Does Œ that Jewish part. Q: Hahnyehki (ph)? A: Hahnyehki (ph). Q: Okay. Did you have any Jewish friends? A: Yes. There were Œ there were two kids in my class. Q: Okay. A: And one was a boy, and one a girl. The girl, nothing special. The boy was the most intelligent and he usually didn™t get the best grades, and I did. Q: Really? A: And I was completely sure that he was much brighter than I was. So Œ but the teacher was giving the boy less than me. Q: Why would Œ why would that be? A: She was divorced and my mother said that she didn™t like the boys. But ananyway, she recognize him and very often when the war in Spain started Œ Q: That™s right, the [indecipherable] Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 20A: Œ she usually would say [indecipherable] say wha-what™s happening in Œ in Œ and he was saying. He was completely sure . He was in second grade or something, and knew what was happening in Spain. Q: The Spanish Civil War. A: The Spanish Civil War. Q: Civil War, in ™37. A: He was really a bright boy. Now, there was one child who was a Œ e-easter Orthodox. The Œ so three out of about 40 . Our classes were large because it was Œ the school was called Treitanufka(ph), something what you learn how to do it. So they Œ Q: Vocational school. A: Vo Œ it was vocation for the teacher. The mother Œ my mother was teaching the grades. And the [indecipherable] pedagogic. Q: Pedagogical, okay. A: Yes, and those teachers had to learn on us. And since in the country there were big classes Œ usually, I think, in Poland were, in cities it will be 30 in class. But in ours it was 40, and once I was in a connect ed school, connected class, third and fourth grade together, 60 kids all together, so the teacher would learn how to do it. Only one year like that. So, there were big classes. And out of our 40, there were Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 21three children who had the option Œ there wa s Catholic religion I think twice a week for an hour Œ they could stay, or they could go out. That was not discrimination, they a Œ all Œ all the children were very, very glad to leave and do whatever they want. Q: Not have to be Œ yeah. A: No, that was definitely not discriminati on, they could stay and learn. Our Œ for instance, we start with the prayer. They would not have to pray with us, only they have to stand up on the very beginning an d the very end of the school. But they would have to pass religion to pass to the next grade. So Œ Q: Their own religion? A: Their own religion. So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the, say second grade, before they will go to the third. But what they learn, that was his only. He did not have to say what he consider good for the second grade. Q: And you™re saying this was true for the Orthodox children as well? A: Yes. Q: Okay. And were there many Orthodox children? A: In my class, only one. Q: And that brings me to another question. You mentione d that you thought that the Jewish population of Biaystok was maybe 30 percent, but after Œ truly afterwards Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 22you [indecipherable] half. So were there Ukrainians in Biaystok ? Were there other nationalities? A: No. I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: I don™t know. But there was a joke after the Russians came in, that people used to say when they were in White Russia or Ukraine Œ we call it White Russia Œ Q: You™re talking Belarus? A: That they lived Bialosc (ph). Q: Yeah. A: I can™t pronounce it properly. They used to say that we™re local, we™re local. And they say afterwards that Polish people wanted Œ for 20 years wanted to make them Polish and they didn™t, but the Russia ns came and did it in two weeks. Q: Well, there is something to that, yes. A: Yes, yes. Q: I remember from learning about the region around Wilno, the people would say the same thing. Who are you? And they w ouldn™t say I am Polish or I™m Lithuanian or I™m Russian. A: I™m local. Q: They say, I™m tutejszy. I™m from here. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 23A: Yes, tutejszy it™s local, yes Q: Yeah, I™m from here. A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Q: Which is an interesting kind of identity. A: Well, because it was under Russia, Poland doesn™t exist for 150 years, and they felt Polish, so Œ Q: Sort of. Kind of. A: Kind of Polish. Q: Yeah. A: They knew that the Œ the others are strangers, the othe rs are occupa Œ occupants. Q: Yeah. A: And don™t Œ don™t treat people the same ways. So Œ so, they were local. Q: They were local. So let™ s talk a little bit more about religion, a little bit. Was your family religious? A: My parents were not. They treat Œ well, I think that the Œ the problem was that they believed in regulation of birth, and that™s against the ga Œ Catholic church. [indecipherable] Q: Oh, so they believed in birth control. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 24A: Birth control. I believe that was the reason, but I don™t know . But they kept us, we were going to Œ to church every Sunday , and Œ and well, th-they try not to talk about that, but because of they believe in bir-birth control, they didn™t try to go to church and pretend that they are good Catholics. Q: I see. But you were Œ y ou, nevertheless, would ha Œ take religion classes in school, and did you go through the various stages of, you know, having a First Communion and a Confirmation, and things like that? A: Yes, yes. There is only one thing. My mother told me that once a woman came to her and said, I don™t want my child to be in a religion class. And my mother said, what Œ well, I™m an athe Œ atheist. So all through those years my mother was [indecipherable] something. There was one atheist. Q: I see. A: And of course her child, who would not go to religi on class because that was Œ only she could not provide a certificate of a ny religion that he passed. So he was not learning. Q: Really? Okay. A: But one in years. So at that time it wasn™t, it was la Œ and there is one other thing, people av Œ who sa y about anti-Semitism in Poland. I believe that there was no Œ not really anti-Semitism. It wa Œ came during the war, brought by Soviet Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 25Union . My husband was a mathematician, and he knew a mathematician in Poland who was very distinct in Œ in Warsaw Polytechnic. I forgot his name right now. And he was very respected, s-some grand or something like that, one year, and the second year they told him to get out of Poland, they allowed him. But he was married to a Catholic woman and had Cat holic child. So he was expelled and not [indecipherable] Q: And [indecipherable] sort of Œ A: That was during the war. And he lived with us, he came to United States, he lived with us for a week or two. And right now, if he™s alive, he™s still teaching in an Œ Ann Arbor. But that came, that one year everything was Œ was bad, it was supposed to be bad because of Jewish people. And I think something was bad, people can™t take very easily. So most likely right now there is the real anti-Semitism in part of Poland, not to everybody. Q: Okay. A: But it was definitely Œ I Œ I want to give you what was be fore the war. There were some Œ Q: Tell me before the war, mm-hm. A: Before the war there were some people extremist who were saying bi yda. Q: What does that mean? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 26A: Beat the Jew. That Œ those were extremists, but hardly ever. And so that was not showing what the population was. But we have, don™t buy in Jewish store. Last few years we e Œ if we could avoid. And the reason was economic, because before Poland received independence into ninet Œ 18 Œ Jewish people were taking part of commerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food, somebody had to bring into the city. And th at was what Jewish people were doing. Q: Okay. A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very l-large. Out of 30 millions Œ no, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish. Because when in the western Europe in, I don™t know, 15th 16th century, when there were a fight and they didn™t wan Œ like Jewish pe ople, Jewish people came, and apparently just past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of Jewish people, because we accepte d them. So that was only when Poland get the independence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the Œ the shopkeepers could not be only Jewish pe ople. And because of that, Jewish people were fighting the new stores. Of course, th at was economic fight. The whole part of was Œ some Jewish people were giving money to this storekeeper who was next to the new Polish store Œ not Polish, Christian store. Jewish people were Polish people. But they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper. After a Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 27time, after a year or two, the other one has to close. Then, the prices in Jewish store went up. That was known, and because of that we were, don™t buy in Jewish store. But that was not anti-Semitism. This was justified of Œ as I said, the noblemen, since they gi Œ were giving to every son, then they were poorer and poorer. That was a cul Œ sort of culture. But Œ Q: I want to Œ I Œ I want to go to Œ I understand what you are explaining, but I would like to Œ I would like to focus on, did this play out in your life at all? Did your parents talk about such things when you were growing up, about Œ did you Œ for example, when you went with your se rvant Œ by the way, what was her name, the servant? A: They change, from one to the other. Q: I see, so it wasn™t always the same person. A: Yes, for 12 Œ 12 years, there were two or three. The first one was the one which worked with my mother, providing lunches to people. Q: Okay. A: So she was my Œ my nurse on the very beginning. Q: So Œ I mean, was Œ how did this play out when you were growing up? Did you know there was a difference between Jewish children and your Œ and yourself, outside of the religions classes? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 28A: No, I knew something. For instance, I Œ I™m Œ well, I live in commun Œ community where is a lot of Jewish people. There are two synagogues. For me it was a surprise that there are different kind of Jewish Œ that they need two synagogues close to each other. Q: That means in Biaystok? A: No, no, here. Q: Here, here, okay. A: In Silver Spring. Q: I see. A: I live in place where there™s a lot of Jewish people. But, for instance, I knew tha Œ and I always wonder wha Œ from me to the closest synagogue is more that 1,000 paces. And I learned that Jewish people cannot walk farther than 10,000 paces. So how can stretch it? They don™t drive, of course. They go Œ walk to synagogue. But I knew about that. I knew about matzah. Q: Mm-hm, about Passover, and [indecipherable] A: Ye-Yes, I like it very much. I didn™t know that it™s a religious, the triangular cake, but we had triangle ca-cakes with poppy seeds inside, and big one, no-not the short one, but short like Œ Q: I think these are called hamantashen, I™m not exactly sure. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 29A: I Œ I don™t know, but I knew some things [indecipherable] that they had to wash the Œ all the dishes somewhere. So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And of course, my parents were very much against us. That was just before the war, there were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were saying that it™s Œ it was completely silly. When we had to, during the war, under the Russian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw , to German Œ Germany [indecipherable] . So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave my mother a sign that my mother has a weak Œ weak heart, and have to stay at home for three weeks. That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw , and she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again.

Q: And so in other words, during that su mmer, there was already conversation that the war is coming, and people felt it. A: Yes, yes. Q: Okay. And Œ A: But only from the west, not from the east. Q: Okay. So this talk about Œ A: We had the Œ some pact with France and England, if some Œ Germany would have attacked us, they are going to go to war straightaway.

When Germans came, since that was already hospital, Germans took it as a hospital for one week. And then they retreated because Russians were supposed to, according to Molotov-Ribbentrop , Biaystok was supposed to be in Russian. So they retreated, and Russian took the hospital, and there was a hospital, with a vo Œ very good doctors. A Œ ampamputation of the leg or hand look awful, bu t it™s one of the easiest thing to do. And people were saying that if that one doctor there would cut the leg off, the person would die for sure. It was a horrible thing.

Q: So, they were going to Œ they were going to Œ A: To take that orphanage somewhere, all children from the nuns. I don™t know exactly what, but I know that we went. There™s another thing. The Œ the first Œ first half year of the war, we were sent to different classes, mixed together. People were saying Œ once my mother said, be very careful what you say, because somebody said that you said, when Polish ef Œ officers will come from Lithuania , we™ll have free Poland again. That was be for me, 12 year old, would be so stupid. But somebody had to say something about me, a nd because that Œ they said that stupid thing. And my mu Œ somebody warned my mo ther, my mother say, be very careful Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 50what you are saying. On the other hand, th is first half a year again, we had in Poland , a cross in front of the class. We usually pray just before the classes and after the school end. And Ru ssians told to take the crosses out. No crosses in school. So in my brother™s school, they had the Œ not Œ not al-always one, but one of them would bring a cross every day, put it there, take it down afterwards. But during the classes, there was cross there. In my s Œ and in my school Œ and that was already mix, because I went to seventh grade from six, that was different school, and because of that, I knew half of half Œ they were specially mixed, so you will never know.

Oh, of course, in every class there was Stalin and somebody else there. Q: You mean the picture. A: Picture, yes. Q: Mm-hm. A: So us Œ one of the girls, and that™s already in that mixed school, say, are you going to pray to the Stalin? And without anything we tu rn around, and then after that, every day when we Œ was a prayer, we would stand up, turn around, so back to Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 51this Œ to Stalin. So, that™s the atmosphere. But afterwards we were always afraid, afraid, afraid. Q: But I™d like to ask this. You mentioned of a story of, you know, where a Russian officer went Œ or Soviet officer went to a pharmacy. Did you see soldiers in the streets? Did you see any that you had any contact with?

Since she said so, I Œ I didn™t know what it was. Later on, when I was grown up, I learned. I remember it. People, as people, were pretty nice. Nobody complain about them. There were no Œ no excesses. But they do what they were told to do the Œ and that one told us to get out of th Œ our house to somewhere else, because even Stalin doesn™t live so luxurious we did.

From that time on, all the teachers, if their Œ if he would come close by, they would start to speak about weather, and things like that. Because everybody knew that if he was let out, it was because of pregnant wife, and somebo Œ the threat him so, not to speak in front of him, and Œ Q: So, he could be an informer? In other words, he was let go Œ A: He most likely was promised to be an informer and because of that, nobody blamed him, only everybody was very careful, because we did expect that he was an informer. And that was the fear all the time, fear who will say what, and what next. So, we Œ we were trying to cross the border. I had a fever at that Œ I Œ I was Œ some common thing which people right now are immunized against it. Q: Flu? A: No, no, no. One of the Œ what™s it used to be called children™s illness.

And because of that, they would be se nt through. But this time they were looking for a spy, or somebod y. And because of that, a ll the Œ our group was maybe 40, maybe 50 people. One child was always given something to sleep, and they Œ Q: So they wouldn™t cry. A: And they ca Œ and carried. So Œ Q: And so you were Œ you went by horse-drawn carts Œ A: Yes.

The door opened, and we co uld see the light, and they said, come out, Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 59come out. They led us all Œ we were close to the border, but not at the border, and I don™t remember whether Russian or Germans helped us through the barbed wire. Q: Really?

For three days they Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 62weren™t given any food at all, and in prison they were pretty hungry already. And then, after three days, they were let go. And good heart almost killed my father, because he was working somewhere, and the woman who was making butter, saw that he was from the prison, and gave him that big lump of bu tter, which she just made. And after three days of not eating and one year of pri Œ being hungry, he ate all that, and was very, very sick. Then he went to Bia ystok , to where we used to be.

A: But my mother, when the war started Œ war between German and Russian, didn™t want us to Œ to be separated. She found a job as a teacher in the country south of Warsaw, and I was staying with my aunt and traveling. That was also something I was doing already 13, but traveling every day to school, which was illegal. It was called Œ because after six years, it was onl y trade school. So my school was called zabawkarska , something prepared to make toys.

A: Mm-hm. Q: I want Œ hold that thought. Can we cut for a second [break] Okay, so as I explained, I™d like to find out, before I forget, the sequence of events for your brother. The last I understood is that he™s a scout, helping people when there are bombardments in Biaystok, and bringing a man to Œ to a hospital, and someone criticized him for that. And then he™s with the Boy Scouts, and they retreat Œ he was a scout, and they Œ they retreat and come back. A: Let me say one thing, because we™ll Œ we™ll show the Œ what kind of upbringing it was. My brother started to smoke, and sc outs were not supposed to smoke. So he was going in the fall, say I™m Œ I cannot be a scout any more. And my mother was in scouting, sh-she Œ she was smoking, she could not be the normal only was helping with camps and so on. But she was very involved as well. But my brother was going to say, I™m not going to be a scout because I cannot stop. Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 65A: And then the war started, so he, as a scout, went to help in that hospital, because he knew that™s more important than that, but he was going not to be involved.

A: Then he came back, and he was in school a little bit Œ well, he was Œ I don™t know, he was taking part in the Œ putting the cross on the wall. But I don™t know whether it was [indecipherable] or there were others, it could be. He told me also, that™s the first half o-of the Œ that™s ™39, that he joined some underground army, and a 16 telling her Œ his 12 year old sister, don™ t tell anybody, but I™m in that. And if they will tell me to shoot somebody, I™m going to shoot to kill. A 16 year old. Q: It™s frightening. A: It™s hard thing. Q: Yeah. A: But he Œ I knew that he was already in something. But then the Polish army was formed in France, and through Romania you could get there. He was pretty tall. He was 5™10ﬂ when he grew up . But at that time he was pretty tall, straight, athletic. And somebody stupid enough, who was going to take hi m through the border, told him to wait at the railway station. He was arrested there. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 66Q: Excuse me, before we get there Œ so did Œ A: [indecipherable] south of Poland. Q: Yeah. Di-Did your mother know that he was going to be going?

I lar Œ lar Œ learned to like learning. Q: Really? A: Yes. Q: Under such circumstances Œ explain for us, explain to people why were these schools illegal? A: Because ev Œ Germans said everything illegal after the sixth grade. Why? The low people like Polish people shouldn™t learn any more. So after I came again to Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 76Warsaw, when my father brought me, it was the trade school. Of course, it was still illegal, we had books at home. And when we came to Œ there was advertising was one class. So we were talking, not looking at the teacher as well, because something for Œ for the schoolwork. But, for instance, mathematics. We had books at home. We had do this and that and that on the page. Q: So you had homework. A: And then we would come Œ yes, unde r German occ-occupation then. And the teacher would ask who had trouble with school. And somebody would say, I cannot do the third one. So come to the blackboard and we™ll explain. That was the kind of le Œ teaching usually when you™re in scho ol you do not say that you cannot do something. There it was the opposite. And at th at school Œ I should really come late Œ when I was in Œ in the country with my mother, my only problem, she didn™t know Latin, and in Polish school you have to have Latin. So I had trouble with Latin later on when I was in proper sc hool. But it was cold, it was a very old building, and it was wet. So my mother Œ it was on the second floor, we lived on second Œ that was where the teacher lived. And on the first floor my Œ my mother would go and teach kids, and I was in bed with my coat, and on the walls during the winter, there was frost.

But my father said no, you Œ you cannot be there, you have to go to school . How he found the school, through whom that they would trust me that they would be there, because of course, everybody could always say somethi ng. So my moth Œ my father Œ Q: I™m sorry, I need to interrupt a little bit, just to clarify. Your mother is in this village outside of Warsaw and she™s teaching legally, because the children are younger than sixth grade. A: Yes. Q: So she™s earning a salary by doing it, and doesn™t have to worry about this. A: Except that the salary was roughly the same salary as before the war, and the prices went up. Q: Of course.

Q: Œ in about the summer of 1941, does he find you and your mother in this village? A: Yes, because he had sister in pr Œ Pruszków , which is close to Warsaw, and his parents in Warsaw itself. Q: I see. A: Sorry, not parents, my grandfather died in ™39, where Germans was fighting about Warsaw . And my grandmother was very, very frightened of everything, and everybody thought that if you go to the cellar it will be safer, and everybody was going to the cellar, and somebody pushed my grandfather Œ by Œ by chance. He fell, and was unconscious til Œ til the very end of the Œ of his life. And that was soon after Germans took Warsaw . But my mo Œ my grandmother was very, very frightened, so she took him to Œ to his bedroom, second or third floor, I don™t remember, instead of going to the cellar where Œ Q: Everybody else was, yeah. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 79A: And she put, not to hear so much noise, she put her Œ what™s Œ what do you call? Something what you cove r yourself in bed? Q: Blankets, duvets? A: Not blanket, but something fluffy. Q: Something fluffy? A quilt? A: Yes. She put the quilt into the Œ Q: Windows? A: Œ windows, so that she wouldn™t hear so much, and stayed with him all that time. Q: Oh my. And yet she Œ A: She died soon after. Q: Did she, yeah. And so your father, when he came back, he found you with your mother together Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ in this one Œ and how Œ did he move in with you, or did he move you to Warsaw? What happened? A: No, he went to Warsaw by himself, and joined the [indecipherable] army [speaks Polish]. That was before Armia Kryova . Armia Kryova is home army. [speaks Polish] Œ when I joined, it was Armia Kryova. And after a time, it was beginning of 1943, he took me to Warsaw. And on the very beginning I had to have Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 80some papers, safe papers, because without the papers anybody could be sent to Germany straight away. So I was working to Red Cross. I was in archives, so I learned how to put it. Everything was what finished, I was suppos ed to put in the sides. Q: Okay. A: I didn™t know at that time, but the daughter of my boss, she was in Armia Kryova, so maybe that™s where I Œ my father found the work for me. And another thing he said, that time there came a Œ through Red Cross, a letter, which I remember by heart. I™m okay. I only lack news about you. In Polish it was. And so I hope that Œ that came before that, ab out two or three months earlier. So Œ Q: Who was it from? A: From my brother. Through Red Cross you can get the message like that, it™s open message. And it came to my aunt, becaus e he knew Œ he didn™t know that we were in Warsaw at that time. He didn™t know anythi ng about us. We didn™t know Œ but th Œ for the first time we learned that he is alive. I always believed, but my parents thought that he didn™t Œ that he died. Q: They didn™t know that he had been arrested. They didn™t know that he Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 81A: He learn Œ my father learn about him being arrested when he was in prison. Somebody apparently was transferred from one prison to another. So my father learned there. Because we thought the he went to France and maybe he died there Œ Q: I see. A: Œ fighting with the Polish army. Q: Yeah. A: But instead my father learn, and because of that, after he was released finally from Œ Q: Siberia. A: Œ prison, he went and waited in Biaystok Œ Q: Your father. A: Œ because he thought that maybe my brother will also come. But my brother was arrested half a year earlier. Almost half a year. So, he was already sent out to prison. Q: So your mother, did she stay the entire war in this village, teaching in that school? A: Up to the first days of insurrection in Warsaw . Q: Okay. A: In my Œ bef Œ well, first of all, my father Œ I thought that Œ about the father, you always think that he™s old. In ™43, he was 45. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 82Q: Oh, that™s young. A: And he didn™t know what his only son did, but he took his daughter, me, into the army. So I joined the a Œ joined the army, I Œ my solemn swearing was on the fifth of August, but much before that, I was already the messenger. Q: So you were in Armia Kryova . A: Armia Kryova. Q: And your s Œ and your swearing in was fifth of August, 1943? A: Yes, but I was much before that Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ because during the summer I was work ing in those ar Œ archives, and I was definitely at that time already in the Armia Kryova. Q: So that meant you were 15 year s old, 16 years old, something Œ A: Sixteen. Q: Sixteen. A: Sixteen. Q: Sixteen. A: And so what I was doing, I don™t rememb er. First of all, my father was at the command of the [Polish]. Middle force, it was divided into, I think four pieces. And he was in the second on in the comman Œ command of the second one. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 83Q: Uh-huh. The second sort of area. A: And he was not the commander, he was in the command. He Œ one of his things wa Œ jobs was taking care of the five messengers. Q: Okay. A: In between I was. Q: And you were one of the five? A: Wa Œ one of the five. And the whole st ructure, wherever it was possible, was the fifth, because you expect that if somebody wi ll be arrested a day or two, he may su-survive the tre Œ Q: Torture? A: Torture. But you cannot count for always. And because of that, if it™s only five people who know each other, then you can told this for disappear, because somebody is already there. And that way it was safer. Q: So, did any of the five that you were part of a group, did any of them get arrested by the Germans? A: No. Q: Okay. A: But one died, I have to tell you, because well Œ Q: Please do. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 84A: Œ if Œ instead of me. But anyway, ju st before the commander of that second [indecipherable] , was Œ had tuberculosis. In a very bad shape, and he had to be in hospital. And of course, if somebody will say anything, so in hospital you cannot run away from it. So, he didn™t have childre n Œ he survived the insurrection. Only his wife, his second-in-command and I knew where he was. So if something were Œ messages to him were going through me. Beca use if, for instance, my father did not know in hos Œ which hospital, nothing. So he was safe. He went out of the hospital, I think about a month before insurrection. And my biggest experience during the insurrection was, I was just trying to find out what Œ we know the date, but what day of the week it was. It was Œ insurrection started Tuesday. And we have in the yard of the house where was the command, we have the mass for soldiers. So it was not the first day. Is on a Sunday then. And after that he came to me and ask me, how do you feel in free Poland ? And I looked at them, I remember that I did not know what to say, and I don™t remember wha Œ after that I say. But finally I realize, this little piece of land is free Poland. And for me the whole insurrection was because of that, I was in free Poland. People were dying around me , I could die as well, but the Œ the important thing is, we are already in free Poland . That little piece is ours. And that changed my whole lo ok at the Œ peoples say trad Œ tragedy, or something Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 85like that. To me it was something, fight in free Poland. And that™s what Œ what he said. Q: Who was this person who said that? A: He Œ he was the commander of the second Œ Q: Ah, the one who had been in the hospital? A: Yes, that™s one. Q: And so his Œ A: And under him there were 2,000 people prepared. I lear n later, from another Œ in his command there were a man who was taki ng care of something, as Œ I don™t Œ don™t know what™s the in command, in Œ in Œ in military, I don™t know. But he told me that there were two Œ 2,000 people in that place. Q: Do you remember his name, the commander? A: His sa Œ surname was Litvin(ph). Oh, I™ll tell you later. Q: Okay. A: I Œ I know his name. And it happen ed that after the war he was in Gdansk and my Œ one of my aunts was there, and they met. So [indecipherable] Abramovicz (ph). Q: Abramovicz (ph). A: Abramovicz was first name Œ don™t remember. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 86Q: Okay. A: Litvin(ph). Q: So his last name was Abramovicz (ph)? His surname was Abramovicz(ph)? A: Abramovicz (ph) and Litvin(ph) is his Œ Q: A pseudonym. A: Œ pseudonym. Q: Yeah. Actually, it sounds like a Jewish name. A: I don™t think he was Jewish, no. Q: No? I heard that quite a few people were a part of the insurrection, the Warsaw uprising, who were of Jewish background. A: Definitely yes. And I™ll have to tell you all about my little hero. Q: Okay, tell Œ A: Anyway Œ Q: Tell me. A: Œ I lived through the insurrection in that part of Poland, in Warsaw . Q: Warsaw. A: We Œ we never had to go through the nin Œ sewers. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 87A: So it was the safest. But anyway, one day somebody was silly enough to say that all people who went from old city, where the fighting was the worst, should sign that they Œ they knew. And they were gathering around the church. Q: They should sign something? A: Yes. They should be who survived and so on. Q: I see. A: And Germans were flying over that, and people were coming to that. And we were supposed to work there, our five. And the top of our five was a chemist, and she came after her shift, she came for me, and I was asleep. And she said, well, she™s so fast asleep, I™ll go back. And she died there. Q: She was bombed? A: They were bombed. Of course, when everybody is gathering, it™s worthwhile. [indecipherable] Q: So do you think was done on purpose? A: German did it on purpose. Q: Yeah, yeah, but the Œ the Œ A: No, no, that was a silly comment. Q: I see. A: People are always silly. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 88Q: Unfortunately. A: Once I remember I was going somewhere. There was a lot of blood on Œ and that was terrible, I never seen. There was somebody Œ we had [indecipherable] something we Œ when you, ev ery day you say Œ say apple, and you have to answer pear Œ Q: Oh, you had a password. A: Passwords. Q: Okay. A: And somebody who came from old city, where the fighting was the worst, when they came through the sewers, which were Œ not everybody survived. And he thought, well, here is everything, you walk like that. And somebody ask him at night, what it is the Œ Q: The password. A: Password. And he didn™t say. And th e Œ the one who was asking was saying stop and so on, and he didn™t stop because it™s a safe way. And he was killed by that. But, it was right, they never knew what it. So I was in the insurrection up to the very end. And when Polish people manage d to get the Œ Germans called us bandits, but [indecipherable] they really had trouble with us. We were prepared for, I think Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 89three days of fighting and three days of ammunition. I have to back then, year earlier, to Holocaust as well. Q: I want to talk about that. A: Yes Œ Q: I want to talk about the ghetto. A: Œ definitely. But here I Œ I want to go to Œ to my little hero. Q: Okay, come Œ A: We were sent to Sandbostel, my mother and I, and my father as well. Then, the officers Œ Q: What is Zen Boston , what is that? A: The name in Germany. Q: And what was it? A: The camp for Œ soldiers camp. Q: So you™re talking about prisoner camp. A: Prisoner camp. Q: So you™ve jumped betw een Œ you know, you had thre e days of ammunition left? A: Well Œ Q: And then what happened? A: The insurrection was 63 days. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 90Q: Yes. A: And at the end of that, Germans wanted to get rid of us, so they said, we are not bandits, we™re soldiers. And from that on, Germans treated us properly, definitely properly, because we were in Sandbostel, somewheres and somewhere else. And my father, from that camp went to Murnau, where is only for officers Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ also. And I don™t remember, but I think it was before the Christmas that we were sent to Oberlangen . Oberlangen is close to border of Holland, with empty space all around us. And they sent one after another, they sent women from other prisoners of war, which was definitely very safer for us. My father said that in Sandbostel they were Œ Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed, they will try to go at any place to our camp, our Œ Q: Area. A: Œ area, because there are men who are four or five years without women. So Germans took all the women. Before that they ask who wants to work in th Œ in the country, or something. I think it was volun teer everywhere, that m-maybe there was pressure on women, but definitely not pr essure on the Œ physical pressure. No, not physical pressure, psychological pressu re. Because a lot of women from the prisoner of camp went to work somewhere. Bu t we went, just sent to that one camp. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 91Q: I want to interrupt you just for a sec ond, just so that we have the chronology right. The uprising starts on August 1 st, 1944, correct? A: Yes. Q: It lasts for 63 days, which means that by early October it has been quashed, at which point you™re taken prisoner Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ and your mother is taken prisoner, and your father is taken prisoner. A: Yes. Q: Were you together at the time, all three of you, or were you separated? A: For a day or two we were togethe r. We were marched, I think about 20 kilometers to Oarów, and then in a very big camp, and then men was separated from women. Q: And then you were Œ A: But we were taken as ordinary soldiers, already. Q: And so then you were put on cattle cars, is that right, on trains to go to Sandbostel? A: Oh yes, yes. Q: Okay. A: That™s not comfortable, but is nothing. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 92Q: So, when you get to Sandbostel , you are there for how long? A: Most likely before Christmas, but I™m not sure whether it before or after Christmas. Then we were taken to Oberlangen, which was an empty space Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ with only us. Q: Only women. A: Only women, from a different camp. I was in the second barrack. Q: And your Œ and this was still done by th e Germans together, and this was done Œ did you know why they did th is? What was the reasoning? A: Why they took all the women together? Q: And Œ yeah, and put them together? A: I™m thinking because they thought that it was safer. They was done properly. Q: I see. A: And we were even received three Œ three times I think, a parcel from Red Cross. On-Only three, usually it would be more , food or something. Once they sent hygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo Œ well, we had the little hospital there, for us, and so it was useful . But, more than half of women did not have the usual period, because of the Œ Q: Stress. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 93A: Not only stress, hunger. Q: Oh. A: We were given food, but Germans didn™t have much of that. We had to work in the kitchen for ourselves, so that™s all again Œ according to a Geneva Convention. Q: Okay. A: I cannot say that Œ somebody once said that it was a special camp or something. It was the proper camp, they treated us pr operly. We had to go out to bring the potatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they as k me very often, what is in this soup? And I would say that the soup is with salt, or without. Sometimes they didn™t have salt. I cannot say more salty or less, but salt, or without salt, I could smell it at that time. So they always ask me, I never made the mistake. So you see Œ Q: That™s amazing. A: Œ it was so little Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ that Œ that Œ well, we were doing everything. We could do during the day whatever we wanted to. The restroom were outside, of course, not inside. And in one empty hut there was water broken, and even the winter there, it was flowing there, so we would go there, or something like that. Q: So the ice was broken, so there was some water. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 94A: No, it was broken, ne-never repaired. Q: Oh, you mean the fau Œ A: But it was an empty one. So we were Œ walked around, there were ma-maybe 10 huts, and only four or five were occupi ed. Altogether we were close to 2,000, I believe. So Œ Q: So how large was a hut? How many people fit into one hut? A: About 200. And it was three Œ well, three level of Œ Q: Well, they were huts, rather than buildings? A: Of course, because Œ and we could wash at the end of the Œ but to the restroom, we would have to go outside. Q: I see. I see. A: But three levels, and of course there were wood, and shins Œ wood planks, and in the middle of it, there was a stove. And of course, from time to time we took one plank. And so sometimes it was difficult to sleep, no, not to fall down, because on that we had shen-nikeetsa(ph), big bag with straw inside. Q: Mm-hm. Okay. A: So Œ but Œ and how did I got the Œ it was close to Dutch border, I had wooden shoes, and for instance, one of my things was how to walk at night. How did I walk to that restroom there on nigh t, so nobody would hear it? Try to walk in the wooden Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 95shoes. So that was something what to oc cupy me, when we didn™t had any pers Œ anything, we learn history. I started to learn Œ I-I started to learn English before that, but we had one book. It was [indecipherable] something like that, it Œ a some book on lowest level, about some murder or something like that. Q: Like a detective novel or something? A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from somebody who knew that, were on much bette r progress, so I was learning what is here, there, at, and things like that. Q: So they were learning English from the detective novel? A: Yes, because we had that detective novel. And it™s still Œ in Sandbostel we used to walk up and down the corri dor there. There we were in such a crowd that when we were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to turn around. But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night, but during the day. And I and two other gi rls who were learning English Œ English was not popular in before the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to learn later, but wasn™t popular. But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish sentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget. But then in Oberlangen it was already something like that. And of course if we were bored, Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 96and if somebody knew something about the subject, there was a conference about that and everybody would cool Œ come and so it was ordinary Œ Q: Prisoner of war Œ A: Prisoner of war camp. Q: Œ camp. A: And definitely Germans treated Œ well, sometimes we, if they couldn™t count correct Œ nobody run away fro m the camp, I don™t think so. But if they couldn™t count everybody, because everybody would have to come Œ Q: Right. A: Œ but somebody sick maybe, we could sta nd for two or three hou rs. But that™s the usual in camp. Opposite us, opposite this four or five huts, were the others, and there was that little hospital, which we had for Œ and also, during that morning and evening Œ Q: Appel? A: Œ count of us, there were boys. There were soldiers. They were Œ the oldest one, most likely 12 or 13, and he would say, on top, march, look that, and so on, because they have to be counted. Th ey were soldiers. In my hut, there were two sisters Œ Q: Also, prisoners of war. A: Yes, prisoners of war. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 97Q: Prisoner of war, too, okay. A: They were, definitely. Q: Okay. A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel. We knew they were Jewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It™s a some sort of accent, I don™t know whether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and the best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better pronunciation that others. But the just or dinary people had some sort of accent which we could recognize. They definite ly had, and the older one looked like Jewish girl. So Œ with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of course, because we never knew whether th ey Œ even as prisoner of war, whether they would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was about 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was. And she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to people [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where to go if she mistake it. And she could not read, so she was putting the messages in between her fingers to remember to whom she has to go and show, if she ge-get more. Q: She didn™t know how to read? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 98A: No. Apparently she was in ghetto. There was no schools. Because she must have been Œ Q: Very little. A: Œ at least nine, but I think she was abou t 10. And so that™s was a soldier, that™s my little hero Œ hero. Q: Aye aye, aye aye. So she would in Œ because she didn™t know how to read, she would put Œ A: She was putting in t Œ in between her fingers to remember, because she could not ask somebody on the street. She would never know who is that person. So, what she did before, for that year, I don™t know. Ma ybe she was singing in the streetcars, or so on. There were some songs against Germ ans, which the Œ the streetcars were so crowded, and nobo dy would s Œ would [indecipherable] anything. What they did before, I did not ask. And apparently Œ I don™t think that she would be alone with her sister. I don™t know whether it was her sister, they used the same name, last name. But they were so different. One was Œ my little hero was blonde, and the other one was dark. Everybody liked the little one, we didn™t like very much the other one. They completely different. Most likely they just lived together, maybe they were sisters, I don™t know. But definitely Œ I don™t remember where I heard, there was a list of people who Œ women who were in the camp. But then with the Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 99age, but I couldn™t find someones who woul d be Œ I didn™t know exactly what their age. But le Œ Q: Were there more Jewish young women who were in the ca Œ in this prisoner of war camp? A: I don™t know definitely. I™m sure that there were more, but this two were in the hut where I was, and I Œ somehow I talked with that Œ that little one. Q: And do you reme mber her name? A: No, I don™t. Q: Mm-hm. And the Œ and back in Warsaw, during the insurrection and even before in the resistance activities, did Œ did you see any people who were Jewish, who were part of these activities? A: No, I was not close to it. Q: I see. A: People in France , for instance, people would be punished, but not us in Poland. In Poland you must have heard about many peop le who kept Jewish people hiding. And if they would find, the whole family, including small children, would be killed. I was not close to that. Now, I lived in Warsaw , very close to ge Œ ghetto. Q: Tell me, what did you see there? A: Excuse me? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 100Q: When you lived close to the ghetto, what did you remember seeing? A: That I have to tell you, the ghetto was fighting. First of all, there was a very big wall with the barb wire Œ Q: Barbed wire, yeah. A: Œ on top of that. I think eight feet, or something like that. On the other side I was walking very often elazna . Q: elazna , mm-hm. A: And so that was Œ and I think, but ri ght now I don™t remember, but I think that the gate, very often before the insurrection in Œ in the ghetto, the little children sometimes were walking here and there, maybe begging or something, and I think that Germans allowed that. Q: To walk outside the gate, into the Œ A: A little bit. Q: Uh-huh. A: A few steps. But I don™t really know whether I remember it right. I think that it was that it was possible. Q: Were you ever inside the ghetto? A: No, why? Q: Well, sometimes when you Œ Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 101A: I wouldn™t get out. Q: Yeah. In the early days I have had some other people say there were streetcars that would go through, and so they could ta ke the streetcar in. But that was in the early days of the ghetto. A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto. Q: Okay. A: I don™t remember next to elazna where I was walking, whether that was big or little one, right. And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people could go from one ghetto to another over that . And that was Œ now, one of them, the one which was farther away from me, star ted to fight a few days earlier, I don™t remember. And then I was walking Œ we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew that they cannot survive, nothing will Œ there was a Polish underground and Jewish underground, there were some connection, but we didn™t have a lot of ammunition or anything, even for Œ for our-ourselves, so we didn™t have later. So we couldn™t help, we just had to look helplessly. And we were sorry, looking at Œ at people who were dying there. But on the very beginning, on that Œ that other ghetto, other part was fighting and this one not. When I was going through elazna street, and over that big wall, I could see a woman Œ it was April, it was warm enough, she was looking through the window down there. They were not fighting. And she was Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 102maybe even smiling. She was definitely not Œ not horrified, not frightened. She was talking to somebody with Œ it couldn™t Œ you couldn™t say joy, I Œ I don™t have the word for that. But I was horrified. How could she be so calm, wh en she is going to die pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand that she was proud. She knew what™s waiti ng for her, and I s Œ I still can see her how it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that Œ that they fighting and not Œ not allowing to be martyred by Œ by themse lves. It Œ it give me a Œ an impression, because we were horrified. Q: Well, that stayed with you. A: Yes, yes. Q: That image has stayed with you. A: A few weeks or months later, my father Œ I used to go by streetcar next to all get Œ the ghetto was always closed to us, afterwards as well. There was streetcar, and he said, don™t go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put Œ hung some people and so high, so you could see it fro m streetcar, and there were dead people there. So Germans weren™t nice to us. And we learn only that during the insurrection, that there was a prison there, and some people were Œ Q: Were hung? Were executed? A: Re-Rescued then. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 103Q: Ah, I see. A: And we didn™t know that there was a prison there. Q: Which prison was it? There™s a Pawiak prison, I remember. A: No, no, Pawiak , he was somewhere else. It was after Œ after ghetto da Œ it was Œ after the Holocaust Œ Q: I see. A: Œ there was a prison there. Q: Within the Œ within the area of what the ghetto had been? A: Yes, yes. Q: I see. Had you Œ you know, did people outside the ghetto know of the transports? That is that Œ A: On the very beginning, we didn™t. I kne w quite a lot because of my father pretty high position in Œ in the ar my. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are close to Wilno, people were saying we™re Armia Kryova . At first they were treated nicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we knew already what was really expecting us, that unless we™ll be strong enough to get Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn™t want the allies to Œ to come in London , whatever, once more they Œ Q: Yeah. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 104A: Œ they did whatever they Œ Q: Excuse me for a second, we™ve got people talking out here. [break] We™re going Œ we™re going to repeat some of the things we were talking about now, because there was some background noise. I was asking you, did you know of Œ of transports of Jews outside of the ghetto, while you were in Warsaw proper. What was happening to them? A: Maybe later we knew. On the very beginning, nobody knows. When ghetto was starting, some couple which were Christia n and Russian Œ and Jewish, they could choose the Œ at least the wife could stay outside. They usually would choose to go to ghetto together Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated, but not that. Later they knew and most likel y we know. But for quite a time Jewish people didn™t know that when there is a transport, the transport is to be killed. Q: So did you know the na Œ did the Œ did the terms Auschwitz mean something in 1942 and 1943? Did the term Treblinka mean something? A: I don™t know when it™s come. Before the insurrection, before the ghetto up-uprising, we already knew, but Œ Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 105A: Œ how long before that, I don™t know. Q: Okay. Okay. A: Because we Œ we knew that German want to kill all the Jewish people. Q: So you did know that. You did know that there was Œ there was Œ A: But not on the very beginning. Q: Okay. A: On the very beginning we didn™t. Q: Did you ever, or did your father ever see any Jews being taken from the ghetto to the train station for such a transport? A: No, no, no, no. Q: No, no. A: And I never Œ well, walking around in there, there was that gate. I never seen it, no. Q: Okay, okay. A: So, most likely they were already dr iven by some Œ something. I don™t know. No. Q: Okay. A: So during the war I was not involved with any Jewish peop Œ person trying to get away, or anything like that. I think that I knew the name of a person who was most Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 106active in ghetto. If you say the name I will tell you that, yes. But Œ so we know that there is a underground there, but we knew that everybody is helpless. The Œ our insurrection was prepared for three days only, because we didn™t have the ammunition for everything. Q: Oh, so when you were te lling me about three days, it Œ and it ended up being 63 days Œ A: Yes. Q: That™s what you were explaining. Got it. A: Yes. Some was taken from Germans, so me was Œ but very little from the Œ being thrown by allies, but not Russians. The Russians, on the very end, helped and they s Œ threw some bread, I had some bread. Q: Oh really? Some bread? A: Yes. Completely dry. Q: Mm-hm. A: We were hungry, but it was the ammun ition which we needed. And they did not let the allies planes land on their side. And because of that there was a lot of people lost because of that. Q: So, were Œ were Œ A: Russians stopped, because they wanted us to be killed. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 107Q: Y-You mean the Russian forces were already at Warsaw and they Œ A: Close to Warsaw Œ Q: I see. A: Œ yes, and they stopped. Q: I see. A: The Œ Q: And had the Œ and were the insurrections, the people from the uprising, were they expecting the Russians to come over the Œ and help out? A: Definitely, because they were our allies. We were not in good Œ in terms with Œ with them, because of Katyn , and that time only Katyn , not Œ not the other camps. So it was broken without us, but I think [indecipherable] went to see Stalin just before that, and Stalin didn™t say anything. And no di Œ they were definitely wanted us to Œ to be killed off. Q: So tell me a little bit Œ I™d like to get a sense of how Œ by the time the news about Katyn was revealed, when the Germans found the site of the massacre of the 4,000 Polish soldiers Œ Polish military men, were you already in Warsaw? A: I was in Warsaw, I don™t remember when it was. Q: Do you remember learning about Katyn in Œ while you were in Warsaw? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 108A: Straightaway, because we knew. The Germans allowed the Polish Red Cross, because they wanted everybody to know what Russians did. Q: I see. A: So, there was all the news we knew, and since people were killed in Œ with their all uniform, there were some papers and things like that, so Œ Q: So they had iden tification with them. A: Identification. We had not di Œ doubts that it was the Russians who did it. Q: And were you working at the Red Cross when this news came in, or was this before that time? A: I think it was later, could have been later. I don™t remember when it was. Q: Okay. And you mentioned to me earlie r when we were not taping, that your father recognized some names. Can you tell me about that? A: First of all, the Œ he was the first one to sign that he wants to come back to his family. And Œ Q: That™s when he™s still in Lithuania. A: In Lithuania . Q: Yeah. A: And then the first transport went out, and he was not on that, so he went back to, most likely the camp Œ Polish people in the camp, who signed him, and he said, Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 109why not I should be? And then in the third one, I™m sure that he knew the names, because there was a ter Œ transport from there. I think that Katyn was not only from his camp, but from the others as well. Q: Course. A: I don™t know. I don™t know what the name of his camp was, but definitely he was in the second transport, not the first one. Q: Okay, and so when Œ when you learned about Katyn Œ A: We knew what it was. Q: Yes Œ A: Only then we learned, because we Œ before that we didn™t know. Q: Did he recognize some of the names of the people? A: Yes, he did. Q: I see. So when he Œ when the identification list was made, he recognized that some of these people had been in this camp with him? A: Yes, because he would not know that the Œ there was a thir Œ third transport. They could be from everywhere, but he rec ognized it Œ he knew that third one went there as well. Q: I see, I see. So there was no Œ no doubt in your minds that this was not just German propaganda, this was actually true. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 110A: We knew, we knew, because Germans wanted everybody to know, and because of that they allowed the Red Cross, Polish Red Cross to go there. Q: Yeah. A: And recognize. And there were letters and [indecipherable]. Yes, we knew. Q: So let™s go back to Oberlangen, where you are, you know, you™re Œ you™re there with about 2,000 other women, prisoners of war, and it™s now like the winter of 1945, the war is coming to an end. Did peop le in the camp n Œ have that feeling that it™s not going to be a lot Œ long now before it™s all over? A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish army under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans ask, why do you stop here for the nigh t? Why your women are there? Because Germans knew. And so they went. I think we were rescued about five or six o™clock in the afternoon, because they did not know that there was camps. Q: So you were liberated by Polish forces? A: Polish forces, yes. Q: Oh, that must have been something. A: And that was before the end of the war, about a month, I think about a month. It was April. Q: It was April? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 111A: Mm-hm. Q: Okay. So that™s the first time you™re free. A: Yes. Q: Aside from the time you were in free Poland in that little courtyard. A: Mm-hm. Q: This is when you were Œ what happened to you? Wh at did Œ what Œ A: Well, after we learn in July that my s Œ most likely it was beginning of August that we learned that he died, on 27 of July, we decided to go and join our Anders™ Army in Italy. And the detail Œ Q: Excuse me, I™m sorry. Your mother was with you in Oberlangen? A: Yes, and my Œ Q: And where was your father? A: Œ father came. Q: To Oberlangen ? A: Yes. Q: Okay, mm-hm. A: Just to tell the news. Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 112A: And we went there, and it was the last month when somebody could still join the army. The Anders™ Army was mainly from Siberia, but also quite a lot of people came who were taken to German army, and they would go through the Œ to Polish Œ Polish people who were under the occupied person, and they were forcibly joined the German army. So a lot of people came like that, to them. But, since the war was over, they was not taking any ne w people. But Œ and at that time we could not go to England. My brother was trying and didn™t before he Œ he died. And so we™re Œ we were in Italy. I was in Porto San Giorgio , and that was [indecipherable] Italy . And there was a school for girls who didn™t finish. So there were some from the Polish insurrection, some were through ho Œ went through Siberia. One of my friend was a tall, well-built woman Œ girl, at that time. She was in Siberia, she was working in the forest cutting the trees. So that™s not exactly a woman job. Q: No. A: But otherwise we Œ we didn™t talk a lot. One was Œ most of them were driving trucks to supply there. And one of them said that when it was very hot, th-they would put wet sheets on them to Œ to cool themselves. But otherwise they didn™t say how Œ Q: What their Siberian experiences were, huh? A: No, no. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 113Q: Yeah. A: Nothing like that. Q: But it brought you all so much together, all these people who had such different Œ different destinies, different hardships, different Œ A: And we didn™t talk about our experiences at all. It was the school and what Œ how to do it. And under the Œ under our sc hool, there were food magazines. And so we had lot of rats. And in Italy you have, in Polish it™s [indecipherable] it™s a sort of Œ something like a Œ a Œ over your bed when you sleep, so Œ Q: A mosquito net. A: Mo-Mosquito net. And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once. My other experience from there was I couldn™t sleep, I went there, and down there, there was Œ we have military in Œ people who were taking care of the food under that, and th Œ about us, and somebody who was passing by , another soldier, came and say, oh well, you have a good Œ so many women ar ound you. And he th Œ the one who was there said no, there are good people, good women there. Q: So, in other words, there were people who were looking at you in a different way. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 114A: Well, some other people thought that well, when there are women and whatever happened. But no Œ no, it was Œ it was not . And the man who Œ who was there said so. So I heard it. But Œ Q: We Œ were these soldiers? A: Yes, Polish soldiers. Q: Both pole Œ yeah. A: Polish soldiers. Q: I-I have a question about Œ about General Anders™ Army. Why would people be joining the army, his army, after the war is over? What would have been the reason for that? A: We didn™t want to go to Soviet Poland . Poland was not free. Q: So in other words, it would have been now to fight the Soviets? A: Well, there were some Œ I think my daughter-in-law father was in Poland still, after the war, after the insurrection, and he was fighting there. How he got out, I don™t know, because we didn™t talk about those things. But he was one who was still fighting Germans and Russians and he Œ he was a Œ we did not fight Russians, because they were allies, so he was still fighting Germans. And there were some people left and in Poland a lot was arrested and killed and so on. Q: By? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 115A: It™s not Œ not Œ for us, the war did not stop there, even for somebody Œ we could choose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war, or as a civilian. And many people decided to go as civilian. If they were found later by Russians that they were in the underground army, they w ould be arrested, killed. Q: I see. A: So Œ Q: So even though they were allies, having fought in an underground army, they were threats. A: No, no. Q: Yeah. A: They were not. Q: Okay. A: This Œ right now when I am looking at the Ukraine it™s exactly what™s happen in ™39 in Poland, [indecipherable] their people. Q: Yeah. A: Whatever. They don™t mind. So Œ Q: What happened to you after Italy? What Œ what happened after that? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 116A: After a year I wanted so much to go to England when my brother was alive Œ we had to go to England and to be resettled. So I was in the camp there, and another year of school, and so I have my matriculation in Polish system. And Œ Q: So in other words, you, while your brot her was alive, he wasn™t able to get you to England Œ A: But then I had to Œ Q: Œ but after he died, you could go. A: I had to go. After a year, all the Polish soldiers were there, and tried to be resettled there. Q: I see. Was there any effort to resettle you into Poland? A: Whoever want to go, could go. And out of Œ we were in [indecipherable] this is Œ there were about 30 girls in [indecipherable]. Two of them went. And if you consider that they were mostly young women, because it was the Œ we were in school, so it was from say 16 to 20, 22, only two decided to go to Poland. Q: Yeah. A: And that was why there are so many people stayed outside. We didn™t recognize the Poland as it was. Q: Yeah. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 117A: And I ne Œ I thought I send my children when they were grown up, to Poland. My oldest one, I told him, if somebody will ask you something, answer in English, not in Polish, so they will treat you as a foreigner. Because that was at the time when it Œ it could be dangerous, I didn™t kn ow. He was 16 at that time. But I never expected that I will be able to go to Poland. So, we never expected that, and we Œ we didn™t expect that at our lifetime, Poland will be free. Q: Yeah. A: But right now is still after Ukraine, what would be next is Lithuania, and Poland , they Œ they were mentioning that at Œ at first. But both Lithuania and Poland are in Europe right now Œ Q: In the European Union. A: Œ and Ukraine is not. So, hopefully they won™t be able to. Q: I want to ask about then your later, your parents, did they go to England with you? A: Yes, yes, because they were in the army. Q: Okay. And Œ A: My mother was still teaching. Na Œ no, she was helping, she wasn™t teaching in school. We had proper teachers, with good education, better than my mother. And my father, he was going to be sort of expert. I don™t know what he was doing before Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 118the war, but when the National Health Service was starting in England , he was supposed to help as an ad visor, even without the English language. And then he got tuberculosis and a heart attack. He died on seven heart attack at that time. Q: Oh, my. A: He died when he was 64. Q: And this was in what year? A: That was in London . Q: And this was in the 50s? In the 1950s or 1960s? A: That Œ it was Œ no, no, at ‚60 my husband and I came to United States, and I hoped to show the house and everything to my parents, and my father died two years later. Q: So in the early 60s. A: They were still in England . Q: Okay. A: In England they Œ they were given the social health, because my Œ both Œ well, if my father could not be the expert Œ Q: Right. A: Œ in his [indecipherable] my mother was teaching in Polish schools. The Œ we have Saturday Polish schools everywhere, always. So she was helping with that. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 119But she could not work without the langua ge. And when you™re older it is very difficult to learn. Q: So you Œ you spent a good decade or more in pole Œ in England , in the [indecipherable] A: Thirteen years. Q: Okay. So Œ A: And then my husband Œ there was Po lish university Œ college. He was a year ahead of me, and after a time they said we were under the University of London. So we had to pass the exams once a year, and that was a college. And my husband still can Œ could go in Polish only. I had Œ I was a year later, in English, and I was not good in English. I failed five times, so I didn™t finish it there. But I wanted to finish it, so when I came to this country, there Œ in England there is no Œ nothing. How Œ you don™t call grades is Œ for each one you have one or two what Œ I lost the word, I™m telling you Q: It™s okay. So for Œ A: But anyway, I could not pass whatever I already learn in engli Œ in England, only I had to pass it by exam. Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 120A: So my husband was teaching at the University of Maryland , and I was studying there. And I finish my study, I have my bachelor at 42. Q: Congratulations. Congratulations. A: It wasn™t easy. I just wanted to finish. Q: And he Œ he Œ was it Œ and so if I understand it properly, it was that he was able to pass his exams in England in the Polish language Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ which made it easier. A nd by the Œ and you, coming a year later, had to take those exams in English, even though you knew the subject matter. Then, because it was in English, it was hard for you to do. A: Well, I had to pass five exams. One was most likely mathematics; physics and something like that. Lab. And I was passing four, and the fifth was English, which I could not pass. I think five times I failed. Q: I see. A: So then I was studying by myself with th e books, which Œ at home. But that gave me knowledge, but nothing. A nd when we came to this country t Œ first two years I didn™t do anything. And then I join and Œ at University of Maryland, my husband was teaching there, we wer Œ lived in Maryland , but they said, you have to pay as much as a foreigner. Not lower as Marylander. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 121Q: Wow. A: So I was really angry with that Œ them . But later I was going to get my bachelor and then fight by-laws with that. And [indecipherable] some Chinese or somebody else did it before me. Q: Okay. A: So it was changed. But it was hard on us, because we didn™t have money, and here I had to pay a li Œ right now is very, very little, but it™s Œ it still was a lot for us. Q: It was Œ yeah. A: We came to this country with four children, two were born in this country. Q: So you have four childre n? That™s was my next Œ A: Six children right now. Q: You have six children? A: Mm-hm. Twenty-three grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren. Q: Oh my goodness. A: Yes, I am rich. Q: How wonderful. How wonderful. I take it your husband is also po Œ was also Polish? Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 122A: Yes, we lived in Warsaw a few blocks away, but we met in England. He went through the insurrection, through Italy. In Italy he was studying at Turin University. How he did, I don™t know, becaus e he did Œ didn™t know span Œ Q: Italian? A: Italian. So maybe that™s where something in English, I Œ I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: But he Œ Q: And why Œ A: Œ was studying there for a year. Q: Œ why did you leave the U.K. to come to the United States? What was the reason? A: My husband started to study in England , higher degree. Somebody advised him to Œ to go to one place, and to do [indecipherable] engineering, and he finish master in engineering. And he hated if somebody will call him engineer. He wanted to study mathematics. And his professor in Polish university told him, you are too old for that. He finish, he got the doctorate in mathematics. And apparently, it was so well thought in this country about the degree he got in England , that he went with somebody he knew from one of the meeting of people with Œ whatever their interest. He took him and my husband got seve n offers of a job. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 123Q: Wow. A: And he choose, like that, Maryland, and we are in Maryland ever since. Q: Oh my. And you said you have six children? A: Yes. Q: And we talked about this a little bit earlier, but tell me, have Œ do your children know your story, your history, your experiences? A: I know that my daughter once said so mething was so Œ so out of reason. So apparently we didn™t talk enough about it. Q: I see. I see. Do any of the grandchildren express interest or curiosity about these things? A: Sometimes I talk, but I think they do n™t think it™s very important. I don™t know. Q: Okay. What would you want younger generations to understand about what your generation went through, what your parents™ generation went through? A: Somehow I™m dissatisfied with people who right now go out and there™s no Œ not enough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to Œ to work, they do. I Œ they don™t really think of coming back. They do n™t think really that they should belong to Poland and not to be outside this. And it seems to me they™re Œ they™re a completely different generation. I lived in free Poland , which was under 150 years when we were not free. And right now some people are Œ in Poland are Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 124mixed up, and they don™t recognize that they were not free under the Soviet occupation. There is a lot of progress in the country, as I Œ I think I mentioned to you that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to Œ from Biaystok to Warsaw. And that half of main road was paved and some half wasn™t. Right now, even in the village where my mother lived there, everything is paved. There is electricity. Right now there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si Œ small. So it™s easy to pick. So you have to Œ Q: They™ve been Œ they™ve been raised that way, yeah. A: Œ start Œ raised like not Œ not only it™s a different kind of cherries, not the big one. So that had to be change, you don™t ch ange it from year to year, you have to do it. And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000 people, and one Œ one with higher educatio n only. So education was allowed, but also some people were pushed, and th ey should not have the Œ that higher education. But definitely everybody ha s the Œ much more opportunity. So, the villages went up, and because of that, some people from there don™t feel that we were not free for so many years. We Œ us being outside, we knew what was happening. They accepted what it was, and it wasn™t a free Poland. So Œ Q: And so you™d want people to have a Œ have a greater understanding of what freedom means. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 125A: Yes. And maybe it™s coming. Some people say that schools are not as Œ as good as it used to be. I know from my mo-mother that after we got independence in [indecipherable] the schools were Œ they were supposed to be like the schools in Switzerland. That was the example for us. But my mother wa-was going with some inspector, wh-who Œ who he was I don™t k now, about once a year for three days, to different schools in the country, where the teacher would have to pass an exam to be Œ Q: A teacher, yeah. A: Œ a teacher there. So some people were not very well educated, and the schools went Œ the level of schools went up and ap parently they say that right now is going down. I don™t know why. Q: It happ Œ you know, the Œ it still is c ountries in development, after Œ after such changes, it takes a while for Œ for systems to work, and to improve. A: Yes. There Œ right now there are changes there Œ in Poland, children start at seven, they start at six or something. And they Œ I don™t understand what, but Œ Q: I wanted to ask Œ yeah. A: Œ something is not Œ not very good. Q: I wanted to ask this question in a different way. What would you want young people, and younger generations from other countries: from the United States , from Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 126Canada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries outside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these countries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Biaystok, and the people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you™d like them to be able to get about that? A: I don™t think they would learn by themselves if the Œ if something will happen. But what I am not Œ people Œ other peop le are always dissatisfied, I don™t like what™s right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries. Poland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody. And as I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that. And they could stay and learn. Q: Right. A: Not pray, but learn. Q: Right. A: And it seems to me that only religion, when you believe Œ we believe in the same God, only different, and of course, I Œ I believe it is better than [indecipherable]. But is the same God. And peop le need to Œ to believe in God, whatever it is. If they don™t know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don™t know what Buddhists believe, and so on. But ther e is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 127Poland . But here, right now, I Œ I Œ is my Œ my own saying, that et Œ atheists are not tolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere. Maybe they feel guilty that they don™t believe in God, but I don™t see tolerance in this country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is Œ is se parate of state and Œ and Œ and I think it™s going the same direc tion, lack of tolerance. And I™m very dissatisfied with that, so I don™t know whether people can change it again, back to religious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they Œ they have the Œ right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it™s more difficult, but those people were Œ Poland was always fighting Turks and Œ and Tartars, they were Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were Œ they were always Œ they started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any other people. We don™t have problem with Œ with Muslims right now in Poland. Q: Mm-hm. A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if Œ well, with Muslims it™s difficult because not all of them are Œ are fighting. Q: That™s right. A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base of the social work. Q: Okay. Interview with Barbara Syska October 22, 2014 128A: Social Œ Q: Cohesion, in some ways. A: Yes. Q: Of society. A: But that™s my thing. I-I don™t know wh at else I would like for the children, I don™t Œ I do want them to Œ to believe in God. Q: Okay. Well, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Syska , for sharing your life, your thoughts, your experiences with us today. I™m very grateful for it. And this then, concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Syska on augu Œ on, excuse me, October 22 nd, 2014. Thank you very much. A: Thank you.
