A: Yeah. Q: And, so they singled him out? A: It really depended on the school, you know, whether they wore uniforms. Q: Mm-hm. But they singled him out, because he was Jewish.

Q: What ha Œ A: They Œ oh, however, didn™t leave until 1939. Q: They stayed until Œ A: Yeah, they stayed. Q: Okay. But by this time your Œ your parents are Œ are still arguing about whether or not to leave, but Œ A: I think no, I think they Œ it was either that or die, so they left. Q: Yeah. And you described it a little already, but could you say a little bit more about the process of the Kindertransport and who organized it, and Œ and all of that? A: Yeah. I think it was organized by Œ excuse me Œ by the schools, you know, because by that time the schools were separated, you know [indecipherable] and we sort of left by Œ we used to have forms, you know [indecipherable] in Latin, and it was the three forms that were Œ left for England at that time.

Q: So you had some kind of idea about where you would be going, and when, and Œ A: Yeah, I think we Œ well, the entire class went at the same time, so yeah, we were prepared. But I didn™t think Œ I think as a child, I didn™t think that would be forever, you know, that maybe I™d never see them again. It was like a trip. Q: And how did you get to England , and the Netherlands ? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 43 A: From Œ by ship, by boat. I remember being very sick. It was Œ the Channel is a tough Œ you know, it™s very Œ you know, I think the boats were very Œ they were Œ it™s not a large boat that goes across the Channel , so it would sha Œ shake and rock and I always thought that I would never get sick, but I did. Lot of people throwing up. Q: And how Œ how long was Œ did it take to get to England ? A: Not Œ just four hours, I think. Q: Oh, wow. And you™re still with that same group from Cologne ? A: Right, right. Q: Still all together, and Œ and all of that.

Q: And this is before you were Œ were placed with a family, or Œ A: No, first you went to the family, and then from there into this hostel, I guess they call it. Q: Okay, so you didn™t live with the family full time? A: I did for a while, but I don™t remember how long. Q: Okay. Do you remember where in England you first went? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 44 A: London . Q: London ? Okay. You Œ the ship went right into London , then? A: No. Q: No. A: Ship went to Œ I don™t know, Dover , I think. Q: Dover.

And Œ and then the childr Œ we were separated, you know, the classes were separated, and stayed with that family until we Œ th-they bought a hostel, a Œ they called it a hostel, a big house, with the girls and the boys, one for the girls and boys. And I think he Œ most of us of the pi Œ I think the parents came to England . I remember my parents went to Scotland, and I™m Œ we all went to the United States from there. Q: Okay. So, when you first arrive in London , you™re placed with a family, then a hostel, and then eventually Œ A: Right. Q: Okay. Do you remember the name of the family that you sta Œ A: Monk (ph). Q: Monk (ph)? A: I™ll never forget that. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 45 Q: And were they a Jewish family? A: Yes. Q: Jewish. And they lived in London , with the other children from the Kindertransport ? A: Right. Q: Was it one child per family? A: Pretty much, yeah. And the con-congregation in London took this chil Œ took the children Œ you know, people from that congregation. It was strange to me because my parents were so agnostic, I didn™t know anything very much, reli Œ religiously. And then I became absolutely fanatic, cause the rabbi in charge was this gorgeous man, I remember. And I was just old enough to pay attention. Q: Did Œ did this family speak any German? A: No. And I learned English by talking to their cook. What they did is parade me in front of their friends, this is our refugee. Q: So they were kind Œ A: You know, I hated that, yeah. Q: Yeah. Well Œ well, I guess why did you Œ why did you hate it? A: I just didn™t want to be on pr Œ you know, parade, just to satisfy their generosity. Q: So they were kind of almost putting on a show, you know? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 46 A: Yeah, they di Œ exactly, yeah. Q: This is Œ look at what we™re doing. A: Yeah. Q: Oh, I see. I see. Did that happen often? A: I don™t remember, but it was Œ when it did, it was not much fun. Q: Yeah. So when you arrive, you have, you know, your school English, and what you had learned from your father. A: But not, you know, conversational English. I learned that from t he cook. Q: Di Œ and why Œ why the cook? You just Œ A: I Œ I don™t know. I think I liked her, and she Œ you know, I could talk to her. Q: Did this family have any children? A: I don™t remember, you know? This is Œ that part is so hazy for me right now. Q: Yeah. Did you go to school there? A: Yeah, in London , yes, until the war, and then we were evacuated to the Midlands , each class. And then I stayed with an English family that took Œ I think they were paid by the government. Q: What Œ A: That was weird, cause they had no children, and that Œ that was really weird. Q: Oh, okay. What was school like in London ? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 47 A: I don™t really remember, I think it was just school. Q: Was it Œ I mean, you™re still learning the language, so Œ A: Right. Q: I mean, did that make school Œ did you like going to school in England , or Œ A: You know, I Œ it™s very hazy. I have no idea whether I liked it or not. But I had to speak it very quickly, you know, speak English very quickly. Q: And were you able to pick it up quickly? A: Yeah, pretty much. Q: Did you like just England in general, when you were in London ? A: Yeah, I did. I did. I wer Œ you know, there were Œ it was a very weird time, because it was just the beginning of the war. So, we were evacuated, you know, with the English children. I mean, you know, I don™t know what you want to know. Q: I guess, do you have any specific memories from London , maybe you know, pe Œ meeting people, or Œ A: Yeah, I remember going to the shelters, you know, I remember it was just the beginning of the bombing of London . So, there was Œ you know, it™s all mixed up with being just pretty scared, you know, just Œ Q: Mm-hm, yeah. Did you have any communication with your parents or brothers, while you were living in London ? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 48 A: Yes, because they went to a Œ with my brother, who was already in England , my older brother. And yeah, you know, we communicated, until they left. And they left just Œ just in time, in 1939, to cross the border. So Œ Q: Were you Œ did you visit your older brother a lot, or Œ A: Yeah, I did, he sort of embarrassed me almost, at the time. I remember he™s wearing a trench coat that was almost able to walk by itself cause it was so dirty. And he smoked his pipe. And he was just 16, you know, so he was really Œ Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: So it was Œ it was surprising to see him like that? A: Yeah, well, it was embarrassing, because, you know, he was my brother and I di didn™t want the other kids to know that he was my brother. Q: And I don™t Œ I don™t remember if I asked you this, but your younger brother is in Belgium ? A: Yes. Q: Why Belgium ? A: Because the Belgian Œ it Œ it se Œ it depended on who were taking children in, and he was one of 10,000 children who went to Belgium . And then he went from Belgium to England , to meet all of us. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 49 Q: Okay. A: I remember him coming off the plane with a violin. That was Œ Q: So they Œ they had a spot in Belgium for him Œ A: Right. Q: Œ so your parents immediately Œ A: He w Œ he was with a family in Belgium . Q: So Œ so Œ A: And he was French speaking after that, mostly, you know. Q: Oh, yeah. So it was similar to what you were doing, what Œ A: Yes, exactly Q: Œ placed with a family Œ okay. A: What was interesting in retrospect is that it was these little countries like Holland, Denmark , Belgium , that took the children in. Q: Yeah. A: You know. Q: Yeah. Were you ever, you know, as the war starts getting closer, were you ever treated poorly, or differently because you were German? A: No, tha-that was interesting, because I was evacuated with all the other English children, into families in the Midlands , who didn™t have children. And it was, you Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 50 know Œ I was billeted with a girl that came from Poland , from the Œ what™s it? The no man™s land between Germany and Poland , there was this strip of land where the refugees stayed. Q: Si -Silesia , or Œ A: I don™t remember.

And this is when you were eva Œ after you were evacuated that you Œ A: Right. Q: Œ you met her. Okay. Were you learning about events in Germany , through newspapers, or radio? A: Radio, I think, mostly Œ Q: Yeah, yeah Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 51 A: Œ because we Œ I remember sitting in the living room, around the radio, to listen to the news, so I, you know, knew what was going on. Q: And you were communicating with your parents back in Germany . Did you hear anything from your aunts and uncles, that were still in the Rhineland , or Berlin? A: No, you know, they Œ I think all Œ they all were wiped out. There were no relatives left.

Do you remember learning that Nazi Germany had invaded Poland? A: Yes. Yeah, that was in London then. Q: And you know, did you Œ were you at school, and you heard afterwards, or Œ A: You know, I can™t remember. But I do remember that my parents were on the last train from Cologne to Holland . Q: Mm-hm. And that Œ this was around that time then Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ you know, the war Œ the worst Œ A: 1939. Q: Œ started. What did you think when you heard that the war had officially started? A: Scared. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 52 A: I can™t tell you exactly what I thought, just scared. Q: Do you remember the reactions of Œ maybe your Œ the family you were staying with, or teachers at school? A: No, I don™t really. I remember sitting around the radio, and listening to the news. Q: Did anything in your life change at that point, or did you just keep going to school, and Œ A: Yeah, and then that Œ you know, that was integrated into the English Œ how can I say? I was Œ you know, I went to school with the children in London , and then the only difference was when we were evacuated, I was evacuated with a girl who later went to Israel , who came from Poland . So I learned about, you know, anti Semitism from her. But it™s all very Œ it™s hazy. Q: Yeah. But as Œ as Œ A: And then we lost total track, you know, after she left. Q: Yeah. Do you remember Œ once the war had started, did Œ were there any new restrictions, like were there blackouts, or rationing? A: There were blackouts. Q: Okay. A: And I could Œ we could hear the noise of the bombs, because England is very small.

Q: And what Œ what would you do with the organization? You Œ A: Just meet. Q: Meet, and talk, and Œ A: You know, that™s so hazy. But I knew that even my parents finally decided to go to the United States when they came out, I didn™t want to go, you know? Q: You were so set on Israel then, yeah. A: Yeah, absolutely. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. So at this point you™re in Northampton , you know, with Œ A: Yeah. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 62 Q: Œ with these Œ this youth organization, and school.

And Œ Q: What Œ A: Œ no Œ my Œ my parents finally left and went to Scotland , and, you know, prepare Œ they Œ the only way they ked Œ could get out of Germany at that time was to put an ad Œ my mother s Œ went to college with a Œ somebody in London , who put an ad in the paper for this couple, you know, as domestics. Which was hysterical because my mother was the worse housekeeper ever, and my father was, you know, I mean, the whole thing was very unrealistic. But he Œ they did get a job in Scotland , and we were all able to come to the United States from there. They Œ Q: So Œ A: You know, that™s Œ this is hazy, how Œ how they got out. Q: But it sounds like they, through one of your mother™s contacts in London Œ A: Yeah, right. Q: Œ they place an ad in the paper Œ A: Right. Q: Œ saying we want to work as domestics Œ A: Yes. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 63 Q: Œ you know. Who™s hiring? A: Yeah. Q: And someone from Scotland ended up Œ wow. A: They worked together. I even remember their name, Farkeson (ph).

And my father, because his army experience, was very good at polishing buttons, and things like that. I mean they Œ the whole thing was ju Œ really unreal. But they loved them, and when they found out that they were Jews who were only there to Œ for a certain period of time, they were very, very upset, the people that they worked for. Cause they were very good domestics. So you can imagine what the rest of that country was like. Q: And yeah, so they Œ your parents, who Œ A: I mean, n ever had done anything, you know, like Œ Q: Anything like that, yeah. But, they got there, and Œ A: And my Œ yeah, my mother never became a good cook. It was not her thing.

I Œ at that time I was an adolescent who wanted to go to Israel. Q: And so you heard they were coming to take you to the U.S, and Œ A: Right. Q: Okay. And where Œ do you remember when and where you met your parents? Did they come to Northampton , or Œ A: You know Œ yeah, I think so. I think so.

And Œ and we Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 67 spo Œ all spoke German, we didn™t speak English. So I Œ I™m surprised at that, even now, that they weren™t Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ you know, put off by that. Q: Do you know why your parents decided on the United States ? A: Well, they always did, because th Œ my Œ they had friends, and relatives, and they were able to get affidavits and visas to come to the United States . Q: So they Œ they already knew people there, and Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ you know, were able to get the papers Œ A: Right. Q: Œ put together. How did you get to the United States ? A: By boat to England , and then by boat to the United States . It took a long time, because we Œ the war had started, it was in 1939, and we crisscrossed, you know, every 10 minutes they change course. And everybody was very, very seasick, coming to the United States . It was really sickening. Q: So yeah, because they™re going back and forth, back Œ A: Yeah, the U-boats, yeah. Q: So it took even longer than it Œ Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 68 A: Correct. Q: Œ than it normally would. And ever Œ everyone was seasick, that was Œ A: Everyone, hanging over the side of Œ and we were on Œ the ship, we came over on was a Cunard White Star ship, that transported troops back to the United States who had been in some kind of trouble, like you know, God knows what they did, but they were shipped back to the United States .

Q: Do you have Œ besides being sick, and seeing these handsome gentlemen, are there any other memories from Œ from the trip over, or Œ Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 69 A: No. Q: Œ just being with your family again, and Œ A: Yeah, that was hard, actually, you know, that Œ I™d already Œ as an adolescent, I™d already separated, and to be back together, I wasn™t too crazy about that. But that™s Œ you know, I Œ I™m here, I adjusted, and that™s all. I can™t remember a lot of it. Q: And what di Œ what year is this, that you arrived in? A: 1939, just before the war. Q: But Œ so this Œ this is before the war started, that you got here? Or were you Œ A: No, wait a minute, it had already started in Europe . Q: Mmhm, yes. A: Before the war started in the United States . Q: Yes, ma™am, yeah. A: So that was ™44. Q: Forty-one was Pearl Harbor , so it was Œ it was before that. A: Yeah, ™42, I think we came to the United States . Q: So, after Pearl Harbor . A: Right, right. Q: Okay. Where did you go in the United States ? Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 70 A: New York , for a year, and then came out here, because my older brother worked for a newspaper, then he was sent out here, and we all decided to come. And that was a newspaper, it was a very left-wing newspa-newspaper, called P.M. I don™t know, it was defunct very soon after. Q: And so again, you have to start over, with school, meeting new people. A: Right. Q: Was it different, adjusting to life in the U.S., versus in London , or in England ? A: No, it just Œ I was just older and able to do it better than when I was much younger than Œ Q: And at this point you™ve been speaking English for years.

I can understand some, but not, you know, I [indecipherable] it out. It™s an ugly language anyway. It is. Any guttural language is not very good. Q: That is very guttural, yes. So I know you mentioned in England , there wasn™t really any anti -German feelings. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 71 A: No. Q: What about in the U.S.? A: No. Q: No? A: At least I wasn™t, you know, aware of it. Q: Did you tell people you were German? A: I don™t remember. No, I don™t think so.

A: Yeah, th-they Œ you know, I remember studying very, very hard, and it wasn™t very hard at all, you know, I was Œ there were examinations then, you have to see somebody. All I remember was he was very, very fat, the guy. I think he sat on two chairs. I was much more concerned about that, than what I knew and didn™t know. Q: So Œ Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 73 A: Anyway, I Œ I just Œ I knew everything. You know, all the propositions. Q: So, it was a lot of material, but you were able to cover it, and Œ A: Yeah, a lot, yeah, right. Q: Yeah.

Do you Œ or I™m Œ I™m sorry, did your family participate in any of the home front efforts during the war, like rationing, or victory gardens? A: Yeah, well, everybody was rationing. Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Yeah. Q: Was there enough to eat? A: Oh yeah. No, I never really Œ you know, I don™t think we suffered any problem at all, because you know, I don™t know, by that time I think we ba Œ become citizens, and I don™t remember discrimination, or anything like that, if that™s what you™re asking. Q: Yeah, so, enough to eat. A: Yeah, no Œ Q: Maybe like in England , you couldn™t get some things, but, you know. A: Yeah, what ti Œ you just didn™t, that™s all, it™s not Œ Q: Yeah, you just didn™t.

Yeah, I think so, but I don™t, you know, I don™t really remember that period, and how involved I was, cause I was also busy being an adolescent, so I don™t know exactly, you know. Can™t remember. As soon as you leave, I™ll remember everything. Interview with Jan Aronson August 24, 2016 78 Q: We can always talk on the phone, if you know, you want to add things. When did you first learn about the concentration camps, and killing centers? Maybe the names Auschwitz , or Treblinka . A: Yeah, th Œ much later. Q: Much later, after the war? A: Yeah, right. No, I remember there were concentration camps, but I don™t Œ it™s very hazy when I remem Œ when I was conscious of it.

And it™s really kind of a funny da Œ story, when we stayed in a hotel in Cologne , which was where I was from. And we went to see where Œ the house I was born in, and my parents were born in, you know, in Europe you Œ that™s what you do, you stay in the Œ Q: Yeah. A: And the house was no longer there, and the street was no longer there. And I remember getting Œ going back to the hotel, and the clerk at the hotel was sort of rubbing his hands, and what did you think about, you know, where you were from. And my husband said, we went Œ we Œ we Œ the street wasn™t there, and the house wasn™t there, when we went to look for it. And he sort of rubbed his hands and said, this is what the English did to us by night, and the Americans by day. And it was Cologne flattened, and Œ and I remember my husband handing back the photograph and saying, fantastic, precision bombing. And we left, right after that. So, that was our experience in Germany . Q: Did you go back to the cathedral? A: Yeah. Q: Yeah? What was it like, after Œ no. A: Was standing. No bombs had hit it.

Q: Wa s it nice to be back inside the cathedral that you had visited as a child, or all those Œ you know, the fond memories. A: I don™t really remember. It was sort of overwhelming. It was a Œ it™s a very beautiful cathedral, one of the big, you know, European cathedrals. No, I jus Œ I remember going with the housekeeper, and the maids, and the Œ to services on Sundays.

A2: Well, a little bit, with the present political climate. A: Oh well, yeah. Not really, Lisa. A2: But you listen to the radio. A: Yeah, I do.

You know, I just Œ I think part of it is because I was an adolescent, and I Œ it was more important for me to, you know, disappear into the community. So Œ Q: To integrate, and Œ A: Right, exactly. Q: Yeah. Is there anything you wish people knew, about living in Germany , or in England , during the times that you did? A: Yeah. It™s very foreign to most people.
