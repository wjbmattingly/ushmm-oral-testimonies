Many young people went to Israel as [indecipherable]. Many went to Rome to get education like doctors or others, because in White Russia where I lived was Œ was Poland that time we lived, but it was actually White Russia, and the Polacks were very Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 4anti-Semites and they didn™t let a Jew to become a lawyer, engineer or a doctor.

But one year before the war, my parents decide Œ I didn™t know why, they Œ they send me to Slonim, to yeshiva for a year. Probably Œ or I was a goo d student or a bad student, I don™t Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 8know what was happening. And they se nd me away from house, and it was very hard on me. I couldn™t stay in the yeshiva and learn like I used to, because I couldn™t Œ I couldn™t get used to it, not to see my mummy, my sisters, my Œ a-all the family.

So he says to me, you promise me you™re going to learn good? I said, of course. And I was learning at home . And I was in Œ in the school [indecipherable] Majewski(ph) and I finish up with the eighth grade and had to go to the ninth, and then broke out the war in 1939 and I had to go into ninth, and the Russian are here. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 9So I went to the school and the Russian came. I was there for three month probably, in the Russian school and I jumped right away to the 10th.

You said you played soccer, any other interests? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 11A: I played soccer, bi-bi-biking and I want to became a Œ a teacher in h Œ in Hebrew, Hebrew teacher.

My father [indecipherable] to tell me that we have to know to ride horses better than the [indecipherable]. We had to swim better than them. We had to work in Œ on fields, make a gardens and be physi cally strong. And we used to go out and jump from trees that was impossible, peopl e believe that we™re gonna kill ourselves. My brother and I were the best to jump from cre Œ from trees. You know, you got so many branches in between. And we Œ we ne ver missed it, we always were the best. Q: Di Œ how did you Œ how would you have described yourself then? Were you Jewish, were you Russian, what were you? What did you think of yourself? A: Always Jewish. I had so many chances to Œ n-not to be Jewish, even the Russian army, and in the partisans, they used to call me that, you are not Jewish. I said, how come? You see, because you always all over the front, when I wa Œ told Œ I said, look, the Germans here around, we got to do something about it. I was the first to say, I™m Œ I™m here. Secondly, I know better the roads than many, many people, because we used to go out Œ Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 12Q: W-We™ll talk about that in a minute. You were 10 years old when Hitler came into power in Œ in Germany, 1933. A: [indecipherable] in 1941. Q: No, no, no, no, I™m saying when Hitler came into power in 1933 in Germany. A: [indecipherable] Q: Did your parents know about that, did th ey talk about it? Did you Œ did the name Hitler mean anything to you when you were 10 - 11 - 12 years old? A: We have to have three papers a day. The Moment(ph), the Radio (ph) and Hinde(ph). So we read and we knew ever ything what was happening. We knew everything, but i-i-in our places where I came from Œ I Œ I believe Œ I believe in mostly European, the Jewish people were poor. A Jewish man couldn™t work like Œ like a ga Œ a Œ a Œ a not Jew. He go Œ he wants to work in the railroad, he got a job. Said, I™m gonna take a Jew? A Jew wouldn™t have the chutzpah to go Œ to ask for a job like this. The Jews had to be milkman, shoemaker, leathers, roofers. Even some, maybe one or two or three, maybe families were cement workers, like bricklayers, right? If Œ if he was a carpenter he was to p-put you a door, but not build a house. So the Jews were very, very poor. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 13Q: What was your awareness in, before the war started, what was your awareness of what was happening to the Jews, let™s say, in Germany under Hitler? Were you aware, did your parents talk about it with you and your siblings? A: All the time. All the time they used to curs Œ talk about it, how to get thr Œ how to get out of here, how to do it. So that™s why my father se Œ sold the store and become a milkman. So Œ Q: Wha-What year was that, do you know? A: It was like four or five years before the war, it like 1932 - 1933, become a milkman, it was a better business. And then, this way we had to go out with my father many times vacation in the fields, and we start being more aggressive, more mensch ma Œ stronger and Œ and better people, and we hoped that in Œ in a Œ in a few time, in a few years we gonna make what we have to make in order to have th Œ enough money to go out. You couldn™t go without the certificate there [indecipherable] . So you have to be [indecipherable]. But a man who is married with three Œ with si Œ with five children, how can you go with that certificate? My father would never leave his wife and children and go to Israel, never. Because mine uncle left and his Œ my Œ my father™s brother left Argentina, and in seven years he couldn™t bring his wife with his child from Baranowicze, so everybody used to say, uh-huh, you see? Aaron left his wife and his child, but he took his time Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 14until he could save a penny. I mean, I came to America, the first thing I save thousand dollar, I went to Argentina to Œ to see my uncle. And he told me the story, everybody said Aaron is Aaron, look what he did. He left the Œ a wife with the child and he™s not taking her. Q: So you were in school, and then September 1939 the Œ A: The war broke out. Q: Œ the war broke out, but previous to th at, the Œ in the Œ the previous year was Kristallnacht and it Œ did you know about that? Di-Did you read about it, did you hear about it? A: We knew Œ we knew ever ything, and you couldn™t do anything except to help with money, but they wouldn™t accept it, th Œ the Jews couldn™t do anything for Œ for the Jews in Germany. Secondly, people who came from Poland , or from Lithow(ph), or from th Œ other places in Germany 50 years ago, they send them all back Œ back to Poland and Œ and to Russia. Q: Yeah. Do you remember being particularly frightened? You were 15 - 16 years old at the time of Kristallnacht. Were Œ were you particul arly frightened when you heard about it? A: Yes, yes. A-All my Christian friends used to come and tell me, Noah, prepare yourself. And making the hands like this, like I™m going to get killed. So I said to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 15them, if I™m gonna get killed, you gonna get killed too. First will be the Jews, and then the Polacks. Q: Did you yourself experience Œ again, before the war started Œ experience any anti-Semitism? A: Very much so. Not Œ not so much from the White Russian, but from the Polacks it was terrible. They used to come [indecipherable] and used to scream, don™t buy from Jewish stores. Poles Œ Polacks to Polacks, not to Jews. And they used to make noises, it was anti-Jewish terrible things. Q: Wer-Were you ever in any fights? A: Many times. We fight with stones, cause they used to start st Œ every Œ with stones, so we had to give them back. That was life. Q: Would you describe yourself as physically strong? A: Yeah, I was very strong. I nev Œ i-if somebody gets me, I give Œ give him the doubles. And first of all, I wasn™t Œ I was the type that I was Œ never let people hi-hit me, because I knew he is bigger, he is stronger, I got to start first. And that was happen always, even the Russian army had [indecipherable] I have to fight. When I was in the partisans, I used to go and train people, so they used to tell me, who needs Jews? We need arms. So they put me in jail. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 16Q: Okay, we-well again, we™ll get to that. As conditions got worse with Hitler, di Œ is this something that your family was open and talked about with you and you talked about with your brothers and sisters Œ A: Many times Œ Q: Œ and friends? A: Many times we used to talk, but sometime Œ we couldn™t talk openly so much, because we knew that our father would like to do it, run away, but he hasn™t got enough money yet. [indecipherable] make him [indecipherable] when he wants to go so much. So many times we spoke Œ I used to speak with my older brother, with the other cousins, that maybe we should run away and we™ll go to Russia for [indecipherable] go to Israel. And we were afraid, in case we the oldest too, we™ll go away and Papa stays with Mom, with the smaller children, who knows if something happen, who is g onna help them? And that™s was the reason we didn™t go. Actually, in Œ when Œ before Hitler came, we wanted to run away from the Russia, and my mama used to told me, okay, if you want to go, go. But you™ll never see your mommy again. Q: So now Germany invades Poland in September 1939, what are your memories of that? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 17A: They Œ I remember th-they f Œ they Œ they bomb ou r city, and our house was bombed and wit Œ and it was destroyed. So we already 1939, before Œ before Œ a couple of days before the Russian came, we didn't have a house, we didn™t have nothing, everything was destroyed. Q: Where were you when the house was bombed? A: We were in Mush(ph) in the little city what my ma Œ where Œ what my mommy was born. We went to our uncle over there. And we stayed there for a couple of days, because we knew Baranowicze is a bigger city and they gonna bomb. So we did smart, went, took off Œ ad if Œ our horses with the wago ns and everything what™s in the house, it was our littl e models that we had and [indecipherable] and we came back. Otherwise would have nothing. Q: And so then you came back and saw your house? A: Yeah, the whole street. Q: And what Œ and Œ A: So we had to ra Œ so we had to rent up another place to stay there. We had Œ Q: What™s it like for a 16 and a half ye ar old boy to look at his house that™s destroyed? A: I-It Œ it didn™t bother me the house destroyed, it just bothered me that we have a situation that Œ the thought that Hitler is coming and everything will be destroyed. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 18How Œ how we running away, how can we save it, s-something? How we can do most of it? What Œ what shoul d we do? It Œ I think that the situation was so tense, the rabbis, the big rabbis run away to li Œ to Œ to Vilna. From there they want to go to America, to Israel, to China , wherever they can go. And the people were left like Œ I d Œ I don™t want to say that, but it Œ it was something wrong. The mazel was that we youngsters, we dint Œ we didn™t know about it exactly, but the parents knew. And this was like a [indecipherable], you know what a [indecipherable] finster(ph), schwartz(ph). This cou Œ l-look at it as ar Œ it™s something is very wrong, it™s no [indecipherable] the whole thing. And this was very, very bad, because people Œ you know how you say when you leave Œ when you lose money it™s nothing, but when you lose hope, you lo st everything. And this was a station of losing hope. It was very dangerous situati on. Then the Russian come in. When the Russian come in, first of all, they took away the rich and the Œ and Œ and this what Œ and what they didn™t like the ca Œ ca Œ zi-zi Œ Zionist, and took them to Siberia. The rove(ph) was in shul, Shabbat, they took him, and many other people who came from Poland who wasn™t register. And they took him to the wagons Œ the wagons to Kamchatka, I don™t know where they took him to Œ to Œ to Russia, deep i-in Siberia. Many die from verra Œ from hunge r, from anything. But our Œ our [indecipherable] was alive, he lived [indecipherable] with us, al-all his Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 19grandchildren, his children and the rest of them die in the ghetto barrage. So it was [indecipherable] , it Œ it was a mishmash , that you cannot control it and you cannot say anything. But we were so religious in heart, but Israel [indecipherable] that we Œ we didn™t blame the rabbis. We Œ we didn ™t want to say nothing about the rabbis, but in Œ in heart you have to say, my g ood Œ my father wouldn™t leave because he wants his wife and his children. The rabbi the same thing, got to be in the city, because he got [indecipherable] city. So is na Œ I can™t give you the [indecipherable] but it wasn™t Œ it wasn™t so [indecipherable] , you know. Q: What was it like for you to see a Russian soldier in a Russian uniform? A: Well, I, as a Zionist I didn™t like it, because they were wear Œ anti Œ anti-Zionist and Œ excuse me Œ and they Œ the propaganda that I should become a Komsomold (ph). A Komsomold (ph) means a communist. And because I didn™t want to become a communist, a Komsomold (ph), they wouldn™t ta ke me in Œ into the better schools. And I had to go to sch ool where they send me to. And then I Œ I want to become a Œ Q: What kind of school was it that they sent you to? A: This a old, like old school. You know, physically, t-to learn a Œ Q: Trade? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 20A: Œ a trade, and mathematics. And I decided I want to be a pilot. So they send me to Lida, not far from there was a airport, and th-they want to Œ they want to see if I am Œ if I am fit, if I Œ if I can take all the examines, it just wa sn™t some examines, it was terrible. The-They bring you to a place, they put you on a chair, the chair is flying, and you look over, yeah , what™s Œ what™s Œ what™s [indecipherable] too. So m-most of the people fall down, and then th ey have t Œ you have to go out and Œ on [indecipherable] they call it, to Œ to pick up [indecipherable] and the things, and your head down and the feet on top, to st ay for five minutes like this, a-and Œ and not Œ and not to move. So who was the best, they accepted. And they Œ I-I was accepted. Q: The Russians sent you to this place? A: Yes, true, th-the Russian with the bal Œ with the [indecipherable] th-th-they decide Œ decide what to do. Even I didn™t want to be a communist, they Œ th-they took me in. Q: An-And what city did they send you to? A: Lida. Q: And Œ and then what happened? A: Then, when I Œ I was in the school over there, I Œ I Œ it was no kosher food. It was no Shabbas religion there. I felt that my world is going under me. I wanted to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 21run away, but I c Œ I couldn™t, because if I would run away, they would take my family and send to Siberia. So I had to wait, to wait, to wait until a chance, and all of a sudden the school was burning in a fire. Something Œ proba bly Polish guys did it. So we had to go home, everybody goes home for awhile, and then the Hitler Œ Hitler came. When Hitler came Œ Q: What happened to your f-father during the time of the Russian rule? A: He Œ he Œ my father didn™t do anything . Didn™t do anything. He used to go to Œ down [indecipherable] send people to get us [indecipherable] in a private house and nobody should know about it. That™s the way they did it. Q: Was he able to keep his business when the Russians were really Œ A: Way Œ the business was out i-i-in Œ in one week they took everything away. They clean up the stoves and the milk with the cheeses, it Œ it didn™t Œ they didn™t left even a smell of it. In one week the city was clean up from everything. Was no fish, no bread, no butter, no cheese, no nothing. They sent from Russia. You know what they send? They send bread with roszingas (ph), I call it Œ all kind Œ this stuff filled up in Œ in white bread, what was nice, but you have to stay in line a whole night to get a Œ one Œ one Œ one bread. Oh , they send vodka for Œ for Russia, right? [indecipherable] Jews need wh-white bread with vodka? They need feed, they need Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 22bread, they need a job, they Œ the shoe. So it Œ it wasn Œ it wasn™t good, no. But we played the game, you know, for two years. Q: And then, during those two years, di d you yourself notice any more anti-SeSemitic incidents? A: Not really. It was much better. The Russian was watching that they sh-shouldn™t happen. Secondly, we had the majority of Jews in the city, who came from Poland. We were almost Œ most of the city were Jews. So the Polacks were afraid, so they were quiet, and the White Russian didn™t say anything because they wanted to become higher and higher. And the Russian [indecipherable] to them, so it was quiet. Q: Did you say that you moved back to your house? Or you said it was bombed Œ bombed badly, but did you mix Œ A: A half house Œ a half house was burned, and a half house was standing, but you couldn™t live there. So whatever you could take, we to ok the vi Œ until we came already was everything empty, wa Œ th-the y Œ they cleaned up everything. I came Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I remember I came with the bi Œ we Œ I had a bike, so I came the first with the bike to the city and I came near my house and [indecipherable] so I jump with [indecipherable] with nothing, I went on the [indecipherable] in the second story, and I Œ and I looked, ev-everything in the boydim (ph), you know, the boydim™s(ph) Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 23the second floor, to look with what™s left over there.

And when this Œ when the child was older, he used to bring it to the house wi Œ if you just touch it so much, you Œ you were [indecipherable] already. So I went up there and I opened one bottle like this, and I Œ and I Œ and I was enjoying this, so sweet, [indecipherable] I fell asleep over there. And everybody came home, they looked for me and they couldn't find me for two days. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman . This is tape number one, side B, and we had just gotten to the point where the Germans had come in and this would be June 1941. A: 1941. Q: What is your first recollection in Œ of that time? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 24A: This Œ when the Germans arrived, the first thing when they came, we thought they were liberators too. Quiet, nice, no Œ not Œ not Œ not hardships, no Œ no hard times. But after being two, three days they show what [indecipherable] they start beating and taking people just in the street to work an-and to ro Œ clear th Œ everything what in th Œ done is not in or der, you know, and everything the Jews has to do. Pri Œ the same time Œ Q: Up to this point, did you know what was happening in other countries in Europe ? What the Germans had been doing in other countries? A: We knew but we didn™t Œ we knew everything and we didn't believe it [indecipherable] possible so much. We knew that Œ we knew that everything what they say today is more or less Œ but ma ybe not so much, maybe it™s Œ it™s people Œ people say about it more than it is. So we Œ but we do believe, of course we knew. And secondly, many Germans used to come to our house and said, run away, because the Jews were Œ will be killed in Œ in a very short time. So I don™t know all the Germans for Jews, or the Germans for Socialists or something like that, but they were all Nazis in the army. Used to come and tell us, please run away because you will be killed. Q: Th-These were German soldiers who told you that? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 25A: Yeah, and we used to say, where we gonna run? How? We have no arms. The Russians left everything behind them. Vlasov(ph) give up three million best soldiers from Vlasov(ph) in the Russian army gave up, because they didn™t like the communism, right. But after, what Hitler did to the Œ I call it to the prisoners, and not many prisoners run away to deep Russia, and they told them, look, th-the Germans burn them [indecipherable] they put a Œ a Œ a little h Œ you know, hole, and you put naft(ph) and oil and they burn them. I sa w it with my own eyes. So that was Œ this person decide, hey, you got to fight for yourself, otherwise they™re gonna kill us. And that why they stop by Leningrad, ba Œ by Moscow, by a-all the places. Otherwise, the Œ the Germans would take it away no time [indecipherable]. And say Œ the winter brought, c-came over a ltogether was a hell for the Russians. But people Œ the Russians didn™t come for communism, be fighting for our Russian mama, but not for s Œ not for Stalin. Q: Yeah. It is now summertime of ™41. Wh at did you do that first summer when the Germans came in? A: The first Œ the first few months we didn™t do anything. We just was sitting in a place where we used to say eat and th ink what should be done. Ho-How to manipulate. Nobody was [indecipherable] what to do. Some people went from big cities to small farm, from small to bigger, you know. For the time being everybody Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 26has a little money, the clothes. I-It was the same f Œ the family, you know. But when it Œ after three months, four months, they say that you gonna sit in a ghetto very soon. You have to prepare yourself that you gonna lose all Œ all your Œ whatever you had [indecipherable] Q: Belongings? A: All Œ all your belonging. Q: How did you hear about that? How did they tell you? A: They Œ they Œ it was [indecipherable]. Th-Th-They Œ th-they Œ it was written on the walls that Œ that all the Jews got to go into the ghetto from this and this and this and this street, eight streets like this, five streets like this, six streets like this, and that™s the Œ the place the Jews should be living. And it came a time they say they had to go [indecipherable], so we go. We Œ but we couldn™t take horses and wagons with us. You could take only what you can carry. Because the White Russians and the Polacks were waiting for this moment and they were Œ they used to stay and right Œ ro-rob everything. They took it away. Q: Whatever you couldn™t take. A: Right. And better things, the Germans saw after a few days what the Polacks and the [indecipherable] doing, so they say stop. Now, y-you have [indecipherable] in here. We gonna take first, then what we got leftover, you gonna take. They become Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 27smart. And that™s the way we Œ we Œ we arrive in a house in Baranowicze at Poniatowska street. And over there my uncle Œ my mommy™s sister had two houses and a husband and three children. So when all the family from my mommy™s side to Œ went the other side and the [indecipherable] side all together came into the houses, maybe 200 people I™m telling you, in the two houses, because Œ Q: Stayed in the family relative™s house? A: Yeah [indecipherable] in a room like this, maybe 20 people, we build Œ we [indecipherable] from wood. This is just a bed, this is for the older people. The middle was for the young people, and at the top, the third floor was for people like me, 15 - 16 - 17, they Œ you know, they sleep on the third floor. So Œ Q: Ha Œ had you heard of ghettos before? Did you know what they were? A: We Œ yeah, we knew what they ha Œ what Œ Jews lived in ghettos, but between listen and Œ or Œ or read the paper, a Œ a Œ a book, a-and being yourself is two different things. You couldn™t feel, all of a sudden 10 Jews smashed in Œ so many people in one room. Then, the water wasn™t inside the house at Œ you have to go outside, bring the water. So the water was [indecipherable] but it was not toilets enough. We have to Œ to Œ to build toilets because so many people come in such a sh Œ place. The toilets was always packed, an-and to get water was a problem, but you had it. Then the Germans took young people to work. Every morning w Œ you had to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 28come in the front of the ghetto, and from the ghetto they took the people to work. So, you had groups, people who worked fo r Russian, for them, with the clothes. Some people had, like me, I work in [indecipherable]. This is a group who took all the arms the Russian left and we have to send it to Germany. So we had t-to work physically so hard, no food, no nothing. So we ha d to be strong people. Q: What Œ wha-what did you take Œ what did you, as a 16 - 17 year old take with you from your house to go to the ghetto? A: I don™t remember. Q: Did you take anything special? A: Yeah, we Œ we Œ all of us took th ree, four dresses, you know, and many Œ Q: Shirts? A: Shirts, and underwear and shoes, what ever we can. And you schlepped whatever you could, you could sc hlep 50 kilos, 60 kilos on yourse lf, you schlepped. That™s all you had. Q: Did you take any special books with you, or anything of interest? A: Very, very few, because it was more important to take a lila(ph) or Œ or a Œ a kishala (ph) under your head. A pillow or something like that. Because who wo-would Œ would care for the [indecipherable]? Who would care if I™m a Œ grandgrandma was na Œ 103 years old? We Œ a ll the people who were young like me, we Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 29had to do it, everything. So it was not time to think [indecipherable] books. The older people carry books. [indecipherable], but we didn™t took anything. Father probably took. But we used to schlep the Œ th-the [indecipherable] the Œ many things what is really hard. And it was probably about two, three kilometer to Œ to carry, it wasn™t so easy. So the only thing we could do is stop Œ and again, stop again until we came to the house of our Œ ou r uncle, and then we had to put it Œ it™s no room to sleep, it™s no room. We didn™t have even tools with what to do it. Q: Did the ghetto have a wall around it, or wire? A: Wires. Double wires. It was double wires all around, and in one place it was a opening. Th-The Jewish police they called it inside, and the German police outside, and in case somebody died, to go out from here, right, to the Œ to the [indecipherable] you know, to bury it. And that™s it. Q: Did the Jewish police wear any special uniform? A: No, just had a Œ a blue Œ a blue Magen David in his arm [indecipherable] Magen David in the front and th Œ in the Œ your back, a yellow Magen David. Q: Y-You had to wear one? A: Everybody. Q: Everybody. A: Everybody. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 30Q: Right from the beginning of the ghetto? A: Right from beginning. From the beginning was a yellow Œ like this, half round, a l Œ a little piece, and then this side got to be a Magen David. Q: How did you feel about wearing those stars? A: Well, i-i-in one case I was proud that I am Jewish. But we cou Œ when Œ when we had to go to work, or go out Œ out to the ghetto, we weren™t allowed to go out [indecipherable] we have to go like the horses, on the street. On the street [indecipherable] to walk [indecipherable] back and forth. And some people wa Œ used to bee Œ beat up or killed on the job because the German like his nose o-or maybe he didn™t work so fast or whatever. They never thought that you hungry. Some Germans were very, very [indecipherable] . They used to say Œ take it, I have enough, I ca Œ I can™t eat any more, because he Œ he likes you, he wants to give you his food, you know, h-half of it. So you Œ you Œ he was Œ this was very nice of him. But from the Polacks we didn™t have nothing. They used to come around the ghetto, they Œ well, you got Œ what are you waiting, they™re gonna kill you anyway. Give us your clothes, give us your Œ what are you waiting for? Give it to us. So different between one another. The SS, of course, it wasn™t good, the SS and the Œ the other G-Germans, but a lot of Germans were Œ were [indecipherable] work. He used to say to me Œ they Œ they like me so he give me a name, Otto. Come Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 31[indecipherable] , instead [indecipherable] he says Otto. I said, why are you calling me Otto? He said, it™s a German nice name and I like you, because you™re working with, you™re always happy. And way Œ what could you do? Th-The cho Œ [indecipherable] in life is not to give up and to tr y with all your care how to hold it, you know, because if you™re holding, a lot of people lu Œ do like Œ if you can, I™ll do tr Œ I™ll try. And I Œ I did many things that I organize things that people was very happy, helpful. And that was my father™s [indecipherable] he used to tell me always, don™t give up until it™s on the last second, you still have a chance. So that was going on like this until one day they took me and another older man and they took us to the railroad. They had to clean up the railroad, the toilets. Excuse me. So they took me with him and they ta Œ and the Hauptman, a German Hauptman came and say, you two, you got to clean up this area. The older man wa Œ somehow went to look Œ find a pail and smutters and nak Œ somehow with his hand, poor guy did it. I didn™t do anything. So I Œ and we Œ before we had to go to the ghetto back, he came and he says, I want my two man. So we went out from the colony. They called us and we went back to this place. Went back to the place, he said, who is the [indecipherable] who didn™t clean it up? I said, me. And he took his gun like this in his hand and made a smear on my face, lik e this, you know, my nose, my Œ my ear was in a minute like this. And then with his hand on the second side. And I didn™t Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 32wait. After I Œ when he had th-the hand in the Œ still out like this, I start running. I thought they were gonna kill me [indecipherable] . I ran zig-zagem (ph), zig-zagem (ph) and I came home. And I said to my parents, I am going away to Russia or to the partisans, I am not here any more. And my mom start begging me and begging me and begging me. I was lucky that my name wasn™t on the list that I run away, otherwise they would come to th e ghet Œ to find me, you know. And since then I change, and I went to the [indecipherable] where I work with the arms all the time. And from there, I pe Œ heard gr oup who was in the Polish army and the Russian army, we came out from there in Œ at Œ in Œ in Œ into the ghe tto back from the arms Œ from the armies, and we decide to fight. We have to organize ourselves, we organize ourself. We had a group Œ Q: Okay, ju Œ let me ask you a few more questions first. Bef Œ an-and we™ll come to that point. What were your parents doing in the early part of the ghetto times? Was your father working? A: My Œ my father was a broken man. It wa s Œ it was Œ you cou Œ I cou Œ ee Œ I just look at his face, I Œ I wanted to cry. He was in such a miserable situation he probably felt, what should I do with my wife and my ch ildren? What can I do, what should I do? He was Œ he never cried, but I saw his face, he was Œ was like skin, like very skinny, you know. H-He Œ he [indecipherable] . You understood what I mean? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 33He die in his life. He couldn™t Œ he couldn ™t take this. And when I came home and I told him the story, he says, you got to take it. You™re young, you™ll be alive and you™ll do it. But remember, he says, if you gonna get killed and you™ll be alive, you should be like a lion. A lion. And I used to think to myself, yeah, how can you be lion? No arms, no help. Hitler was [indecipherable] into Russia. The Russians are dying from hunger over there, what gonna happen here? Q: What were your Œ did yo ur mother have to work? A: There was no work. Y-Y-You were happy Œ Q: Sh-She just stayed in the house in the ghetto. A: She had to cook for five, six, for seven, 10 Œ 10 people with grandmas and grandmas, we have to give food, how to get food? When I got to work, I used to [indecipherable] a Polack or White Russian, my shirt or pants and Œ or shoes, when he get some, to make something for soup. O-Or a piece Œ a Œ a Œ or some bread or Œ or something to bring in. And it was m-maze l if you bring it in and he didn™t caught you. If they caught you, they gonna beat up. Q: Wh-What about your sisters and y our brother, did any of them work? A: They were too young. My brother was with me the same thing, he Œ he was the Œ with the same thing what I did, to supply food for the family. And we Œ we used to bring arms the same time and in our house we built a Œ under the floor we built a Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 34place that from our house we could go out to the water supply, to the sept Œ system Œ system. Not septic, no. Q: Cistern? A: Sure, si Œ sure. And we made a Œ a opening to this Œ to the sewer. Q: But the sewer was still inside the ghetto? A: Yeah. And the [indecipherable] house was very close to it. Q: Yeah. A: So we prepare everything so we can go out at night only as a group and nobody gonna know what™s going on. So we prepare ourselves and we were a group who called it Œ Moma Kopelowicz. Moma Kopelowicz was our commandant Œ commandeer Q: This is while you™re still in the ghetto? A: The ghetto. And we had few places wher e they had already about 17 rifles, two machine guns and we had lik e 500 hand grenades, and bu llets ready to go out. Q: How did people get the information? How did you get to know Œ ho-how did they transmit the information to you about this? A: What, the front? What™s going on in what? Q: About the Œ these arms and Œ and how to Œ by word of mouth? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 35A: Pe Œ we Œ we had Œ we had Œ we read the GGerman papers, we knew everything. Q: No, no, no, no, my questio n is, how did you hear about Kopelowicz and Œ and the Œ A: Learned it from a friend of mine. [indecipherable] Q: Right, so, which is by word of mouth in the ghetto. A: Yeah, because we decided he is Œ he is the right man to organize this. We decide that he is the man who can run us. And he was a younger, maybe two years older than us, but he was a Œ a mensch. So we decide that he can be the man who Œ to hold us together. Q: His first name is what? A: Moma. Moma Kopelowicz, because we were for all parties, I was [indecipherable] all my friends were from Betar, some Hatshomer Hatzair , some from Gordonia (ph). So, i-it Œ we wasn™t like in Œ from same school. We were from the same city, friends, but Œ but every [indecipherable] idea Œ idea. He had to be the [indecipherable] to the idea to bring altogether for the one Œ for this one thing what we have to do. And he did. He very smart. And he was the first that was killed in Œ in Œ in the Œ in the putsch. Later. So he was our master of the group, and we decided one day to get out. When we wanted to get out from the night Œ Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 36Q: How many were in the group? A: We were like 40 Œ 47 people. Q: These are young men? A: All ya Œ all young, from Œ betw een 15 - 16 to maybe 27 - 28. Q: Any wa Œ any woman, was it all men? A: It was like 10 women between them too. So all people who used to work by the Germans, who ha-had to smuggle into the ghetto arms, bullets, grenades, everything. So when time came, we organi ze ourselves, this was approximately, I would say by the te Œ November the Œ the 10 th of 1941, we decide to be going. And all the people came to my Œ to my hous e, and from my house we had to go out from the [indecipherable]. All of a sudden came, from my city, his name was Eliezer Lidovsky. He was a big [indecipherable]. He decide that we cannot go out, because if we gonna go out, what will happen to him and the other groups? It wa Œ we had Œ it was many groups in the ghetto. An d he wants to be the top, that he can say to all the groups when to go, when not to go. And we decide we want to go. Q: Many resistance groups. A: Yeah, yeah. So he came and said, if you gonna go out, the Germans will wait for you outside and you all will be killed. So Moma Kopelowicz and another friend, Eli Zaryckevicz , he was from Russia, a Russian officer, was a young man maybe Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 3725 years old. He went with him to the ghe tto to explain them that we are going out, our little group from 47 people, and after we gonna settled, you know, make it, everything [indecipherable] shoot, we™ll come, we™ll take hundreds of people out from the ghetto. Nice? He says no, you cannot go out. He was afraid that you™ll go out, something happened, he gonna be stuck in ghetto. And that what™s happen. So one of my friend, Moishe Taub (ph), he was in the Russian army too, and he was in another group, from nervous keit, he took and he shot Œ he gave a shot in the house with Œ with the rifle. Moishe Taub(ph) did it, and every body thought the Germans will come right now and they™ll destroy everything here. First of all Œ Q: He shot into the air? A: Yeah. So everything Œ everybody went ho me back again, and I had to repair at night, the cement which we did, in case the Germans come to check everything. And I worked the whole night in the cement, in the water, un-until my knee Œ until I Œ I re Œ I repair somehow Œ Q: This is closing off that entrance? A: Yeah. And got Œ got Œ got [indecipherable] like if nothing happened. They didn™t find it out. Now, in a Œ the Germans had a feeling, because they had Œ they had e Œ e Œ espionage probably from the outside people, Polacks, Russians, who used to tell them that the Jews running around to buy arms. And th ey Œ they told to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 38the Germans all these things, that the Jews ca Œ buying guns, the Jews trying to bring guns from the Germans of Œ you know, and this and this. And it Œ it was Œ it was like this for a f Œ for a few months, and then in [indecipherable] Q: 1942, March ™42? A: Fo Œ yes, came the [indecipherable] the first [indecipherable] in Baranowicze. And we were prepared. We were probably five groups, wi-with 500 organized boti Œ rebels to Œ to fight the Germans, in case they come in. One of my friend, he just die in Israel. Ilya (ph) Schneidel(ph). Ilyong (ph) Schneidel (ph) there had to throw a hand grenade, because he was in the police. And he, when he saw the Germans coming, he™s supposed to throw out a hand grenade and we all will go out in the streets, fight the Germans outside the ghetto. We had a Œ we had a lot of ammunition. We had maybe a hundred, a hu ndred fifty rifles, pistols and machine guns. We would kill in the thousands, maybe. So when the Œ the Germans arrive, they arrive few and he thought Œ he asked over there, what Œ what are you doing over here, and they Œ they said they came for inspection just. And this was the biggest mistake. The way Œ where he didn™t throw the hand grenade, after 10 - 15 minutes they came in the hundreds. Lithuanians, White Russians, all kind, and Germans you know, and pouring in to the ghetto, fire in the houses, in the people, in Œ all over the places. And this was a Œ such a tragedy. We lost half of our best Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 39people was die Œ died. The other, after the [indecipherable] Œ after the three or four days of [indecipherable] they killed over 5,000 people and they took a lot of people into the concentration camps, not in Germany, but near our place, like Moldachewa (ph), kola -- Koldachewa (ph), Moladecznai(ph) and a lot of my family went into this category, they took them away to work over there, and they made them so miserable, you wouldn't believe what they did, the Germans did to the Jewish people over there. The White Russian used to tell them things that I am ashamed to Œ t-to say it, what Œ what Œ wh at they did to them . And then a lot of them run away to the partisans and the rest were killed by the White Russian police. We are [indecipherable] who would like to run away to the partisans, but we cannot go. After the [indecipherable], after they killed they Jews, they made the ghetto smaller. And all the arms we had was on the second Œ on the s Œ on the second half. Q: What Œ what were you doing during this Œ these days ? Were you in hiding? How is that you Œ you weren't called up? A: I Œ I Œ I was, together with my parents, when they took out everybody from Œ from my house, when the Germans came in, and they used to came out to say Juden raus, Juden raus . Was quiet, me and my cousin we re sitting near the opening, in case a German will find the place, we™ll tell him Œ we™ll push him Œ we™ll shove him Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 40inside and cut his head off. Two or three, until my a Œ my aunt Œ mine uncle, Yikael(ph), who wanted to me Œ to send me back to the yeshiva, his wife Gittl(ph) had two little children, Moishele(ph) and Jankele (ph). So when the children were feeling the Œ the pressure from [indecipherable] Juden raus, they start screaming. And she says, we™re coming raus, we™re coming raus, we™re coming raus. And she was coming out, and everybody like sheef Œ I mean, I mean shefson(ph), you know, like animals, the little animals that go, went Œ the whole family went after her and they went out. Just a few of my cousin we re left in Œ in Œ inside. After a couple of hours we went into the Œ look around what Œ what™s going on, we find out nobody™s Œ you know, just the both of us. We went outside to look, maybe we can do something [indecipherable] something. All of a sudden the police run after us, start shooting. And we run, somehow, we™re Œ we™re young, you know, we made it. Q: Is this y-you and your brother? A: No, my cousin. Q: Oh. A: My Œ my brother was already Œ tooken aw ay. I forgot to tell you this. My older brother was Œ was-was Œ was tooken away far Œ before the [indecipherable]. They took 72 young guys, and they took him to the barracks where the army was.

And this was the first 72 [indecipherable] before the [indecipherable] . And now we decide Œ Q: Wa-Was there a Jewish council in the ghetto? A: Yeah, sure it was. Q: The Judenrat ? A: Yeah, the Judenrat Œ Q: Can you tell me a li Œ to tell me a little bit about that? A: The Judenrat was very nice, very nice peopl e. These Œ hm, many people went themselves to give up. They had good places t-to Œ to Œ to save theirselves Œ themselves, but they say no, they don™t want it. They di Œ di Œ the top man for the police, and they keep asking for people, Altman (ph). So he said, I have no people. What do you mean you don™t have? He said, you can take me, but I haven™t got people. The people belong to God. They took him and the best 40 police [indecipherable] . The best, and th Œ and Œ what can Œ a city can have. All students from Œ from Œ from college, from this, and they Œ and they shot them because he didn™t want to give Jews. Q: Wa-Was one of the heads Isaacson, Joshua I Œ Yehosha(ph) A: Izaakson(ph), Izaakson(ph) Q: I-Izaakson(ph). Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 42A: [indecipherable] yeah. Q: Did you know him?

And he was the last Œ from the last Judenrat , he was the Œ the top man. Q: Did you know about these cards that were marked with the letter O? Does that have any meaning for you? To show the people had jobs, these were like identity cards. A: Oh? Q: Yeah, I had read that that Œ in the Œ in the ghettos and people had cards. A: Yeah [indecipherable]. We Œ we had cards at Œ from the place I bele Œ where we worked, that I [indecipherable] I have to come out, because otherwise they wouldn't let you out from the ghetto. Q: Mm-hm.

I Œ I just Œ there should be quiet, you know. But all the jobs we had to do, they were sitting and drinking, an-a nd ta Œ and tell you what to do.

A: Yeah, but I couldn™t do it le Œ legally, so I had to wait for a chance and we going for [indecipherable] you have a Œ a mission to do. They send you to Œ to destroy the railroad and they give you two weeks. You have to come back from Œ from the woods to Œ to go to Leshen (ph). Leshen(ph) was a Œ a b Œ this Œ the Œ the road is come at here this way and this way and Œ and it was the last time that we going like this.

Of course, I used to ride with my father for years, bring the milk from the Œ from the Œ from the [indecipherable] you know, from the farms. I know. When it was dark we two quietly moved away, moved away with the Œ from the others, and pffft, we ran Œ we went into the ghetto. Q: How far was the ghetto from where you were?

A: You Œ you ha you have li Œ you have another probabl y 10,000 people left, maybe more. So he went to his friend Œ his friend and I went to see my uncle, I still had a uncle from my mommy™s side. But we went to the ghetto in these houses, my aunt came over there, I Œ I knock on the door an d my uncle wake up, he says, who is this? I said me. He says to me, I thought you were already dead. Everybody said you were di Œ you dead, they killed you. How come you alive? And he fall then on me for Œ from his place, and he start crying. I said, Uncle, don™t cry, prepare yourself. I couldn™t talk because if I talked to him, every Œ the whole Œ the whole house would Œ would run Œ like to run to [indecipherable] . Can I take from the hundreds of Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 51people into Œ to the partisans? What shall I do? I™m asking you. And [indecipherable] question, you told me before not to ask questions. What can you do? I ca Œ I Œ I Œ I left Œ right away I saw I am Œ I have problems, you know. If I™ll stay here they Œ they gonna eat me up. And what Œ everybody wants to life Œ they want to live. I™ll Œ I left this place and I went to other place and hide Œ in hiding. And I came to my friend I told him the story. He says no, it™s no good, we gotta take everybody. Be Œ over here, hundreds of people are waiting already. I don™t know how we™re gonna get out from the ghetto. They™re watching every step of us [indecipherable] like that. We had to leave. We had to leave the ghetto at night and tell the people how to get out from Œ from th e job that they working. They should come on the Œ to Œ on the Polish cemetery be hind the city, and we™ll be there, and we™ll come over there when they Œ by like 10 o™clock at night. In the meantime, we had one Polack, his name was Hatcha(ph). He was one Polack in the city who helped Jews. And says, whenever you go out or you come, you can go to my place where my car is there, and you can sit and wait over or whatever you need to do, stay there, with no problems. It was very nice of him. So we went there and we waited over, and then we went to the Œ by 10 o™clock we went to the Polish Œ Q: Cemetery. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 52A: Œ cemetery, and we say three [indecipherable] [whistles]. They understood, they came out and we took them and we went to the partisans. We came to the partisans Œ Q: Okay, how many people were in the group? A: 17. Q: And who were they? A: I Œ I think you got here the names, I said, my wife is the first, and then two sister, Luba(ph) and S-Simma(ph) Mandel . And then sh Œ a couple Œ Q: Were these all young people? A: All young. All young between 17 to 25 maybe. Q: So you knew your Œ your fu ture wife at that point? A: I knew, but Œ Q: How did you know her? A: I know her because she run away from Poland 1939 and she came to her aunt Œ to her uncle. Her uncle married my Œ my cousin in 1938 and he came to America. So when they broke Œ when the war broke out, she saw with the Germans beating up shi Œ Jewish children in her little place, so she decide to run away, came to us. So she was in a different place, but I know her, I Œ so I said, if I can t-take her, why shouldn™t I? And Œ because she was actually working with the whole group on one Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 53place. They used to wash for the Germans officers the Œ the clothes. So they said to go back to the group and come to the ghe tto, they went Œ couple Œ couple of us before that, in hiding and then di Œ they we nt to the cemetery. So I had to take the whole group, but I don™t know the people, I didn™t know. I know maybe five, six, seven people, maybe. I didn't know even. Q: So you and Œ were the Œ the two leaders brought these people back to the partisans? A: Excuse us? Q: You said you Œ you Œ you Œ you led these people back to the partisans at night? A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, at night. It took us more, took us two days to come. It was 70 kilometer. And then from 10 o™clock at night until four o™clock in the morning [indecipherable] young people hungry a little bit, and a little tired, you cannot make 70 kilometer, it™s hard. And the snow was like this. So we had to come to a place and we had a man in a Œ in a place we called Ouchosse(ph). And in this place they had a man, a Russian guy who came, the first World War II, he married a White Russian, and his name was Matt Rosov(ph). And he was the guy who told us all this. I sent my son to the police, so nobody will think that I will let Jewish partisans in here. And this way we used to come and with the cows, used to stay. We open Œ we knew how to open and get in, take hay, lay down sleep over and next Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 54day in the evening, we used to go. Come in the Œ that day we came to the partisans and we arrived at the partisans, the group looked, five to six ladies, no arms, just two Œ two pistols or some, and they said, who needs ladies, who needs Jews? It was Œ was a Œ a Œ it was a Œ you know, we need, arms we need, we don™t need these things. And they wanted to kill me because th-the Œ you was organize this, you. Because they knew all the time I used to say, let me go to the ghetto, to bring people out, bring arms, bring this. So they knew that I Œ I am the [indecipherable] I was a [indecipherable] to me Œ talk to Œ to go, I Œ before I Œ they knew tha Œ I went already. So, they knew that I Œ I was the one, but they didn™t kill me, but they had a eye on me and that next time what Œ what to do. Q: Were you wearing any kind of uniform? A: Just a Œ a b Œ a blue jacket and still, I call it boots. That™s it. Q: What did you do with that Jewish star you had to wear? A: We had Œ we Œ we Œ we were Œ we were clean, we were washing. We washed every day in cold water. Q: No, no, the Jewish star that you were Œ you had to wear before in the ghetto, what did you do with it? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 55A: Oh [indecipherable]. Well, maybe not, maybe I had it, because we had to go in Œ in the ghetto back again, back and forth. I Œ I Œ I k Œ I keeped it, I think, a long time. And then it was a little quiet. Q: Wha-What was the name of the Œ of the commandeer of this partisan group? A: This time Œ Q: The Russian commandeer. A: Bogachev(ph). This time [indecipherable] commandeer was Bogachev (ph) the commandeer. And Œ Q: And the Jewish leader was? A: It wasn™t already this Œ this Œ the Jewish leader jus Œ Jewish leader already was killed. What was happen, the group who took us in the beginning, the Zhorkins (ph), what I said, they murderers, they were o Œ that time already like 30 people. And they didn™t accept no Russian, no Polack, no nobody, they were just their group, all Russians, anti-Semites. And they wer Œ group was separate. We were already few hundred people. So they decide one day that the Germans supposed to come to check the roads and the railroads, so we want to go with the crossfire there from [indecipherable] from the other side, and they were gonna kill them. But that™s what they did. Moma Kopelowicz was our commandeer. We went like maybe 20 - 30 people, we were sitting in one end of the [indecipherable] and Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 56they sit on the other side, the Œ the Œ the Russian, the Zhorkinses (ph). By the time the Germans arrive, they quietly left us alone. So when we asked Œ asked fire from this side, right, they ca Œ they turn around and came from the other side where the Russians supposed to be. And was a lot of Œ l-lot [indecipherable] between them. They jump in Œ into the woods, arms they have so much, they shot on us for an hour, millions of Œ of bullets. And we were watching every bullet we had, we Œ we watch to be perfect, you know. [clears throat] Excuse me. And all of a sudden, my friend Kopelowicz shot a [indecipherable] in his head and he fall down. And a Œ and a second one he was wounded, and then the third one shot him. So our friend Moma took out his Œ his [indecipherable] and he want to cover his Œ his Œ so he was with his hand [indecipherable] like this on his head and that™s the way they fall. We made it until the evening, in th e evening we came. We took off all the blood all around him, we made a kevir (ph), we say Kaddish, and we let him, the first ca Œ the first kalban (ph), the first casualty we had. And then, from then we n Œ we knew that™s a war, we have to Œ we™ll have casualties, we got to get used to it. It was very hard for us, because in so many hundred and thousands of people were killed in the ghetto, it wasn™t so shocked like here in the woods. [indecipherable] Q: Wha-What™s the difference? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 57A: Because over here we Œ we were like partisans, we Œ we fighting the Germans. They cannot kill us, we got to kill them. So it was Œ and he was the Œ the Œ the Œ the [indecipherable], he was [indecipherable] it was a shock. But then we get used to it, people get killed, it™s a war. They killed, they Œ we kill and that™s Œ that™s the way it goes. And then from then Œ Q: What Œ what were the daily living conditions like? Where did you sleep? A: The living condition, the first time we sleep under the sky, under the trees. We used to take the ha Œ the dry wood, branch es and make a fire and Œ and Œ and cook like soup. Some meat or some fish or some fish or some this, we Œ we took away from the Christian population. But after being a half a year already, we went deep into the German zones and we took horses and cows and pigs, and whatever you want to have. And we had like a farm in Œ in Œ in Œ in Œ in the woods. And Jews, you know, they made alrea dy milk, cheeses and Œ and [indecipherable] an-and meat, and it was Œ people, maybe 10 worki ng and preparing everything. Sh Œ new shoes, new hairs, new clothes, and some people the arms, and th-th Œ a factory become i-in Œ in Œ in Œ in less than a year. You wouldn™t believe what there Œ a hospital we built under Œ under the earth, deep and from the trees we had air. The trees were so big, but very old, so you could see the sky. Q: So you had one location, you were not always moving. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 58A: No, no, we Œ wa Œ one Œ one location. This is what one location, was a very good place. We call it Ostrow(ph). Why we call it Ostrow(ph)? In Russian is a place where all around the swamps. And one place in the center, or more or less in the center, is higher. This place is dry. So we used to live in these places. And over there be you Œ for winter, we Œ we prepar e houses 50 percent inside the earth, and 50 percent covered with wood, right, and we used to take away from the Germans benzene (ph) or Œ or things like this. So we had a [indecipherable] in side, one side open with many holes, put wood and we we re burning all of 24 hours. Was warm, beautiful. And a lot of posts, posts ever y hundred meter, every thousand meter, every 1500 meter, every 2,000 meter. And th en, th-the Œ when we became already strong, we had the radios an -and wit Œ big radios and wh at Œ music and dancing like Œ like a normal family. Yeah, because the Russians send us paratroopers and they came with radios and Œ and ma ny things. And since then Œ Q: So Russian soldie rs kept joining you? A: Yes, we had the Russians Œ I told you, we have the Russians and Jews together, it™s no Œ no more are Jews separate. Q: No, no, no, no, but Russians soldiers would join you, continue to join Œ come into the group? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 59A: Yeah, a lot. Jews wasn™t there already any more, because almost the Jews Œ some, a gr Œ little Œ maybe after the second [indecipherable] already was nothing left, one group 200, one grou p 500, who was to work for the Germans. They were Œ most just were killed already. Q: Oh. A: But we Œ we Œ we wanted to take car e of the Jews too, take them out. So Œ Q: What were your thoughts when you hear d about the second and third selections in the ghetto? A: We went, let™s say, to Œ to Œ to Œ to the ghetto few times, and we knew that this Œ this will happen. So I went tha Œ over there, and instead to take a whole group, I took out two Œ two people. Bayla(ph) Trebovicz (ph) and Tuvia(ph) Narnek (ph). I took them v Œ all the people went already to the [indecipherable] they took them to kill, and I took the two girls and went out from the ghetto, and I don™t know what the mazla (ph) had, they didn™t caught us. Q: Wh-Why did you pick them? How did you decide? A: There was one had a Œ a Œ a husband in the Œ in the partisans and the second had a brother. And they were prepared we should take them, so I Œ I Œ they send me to take them. I want to take them more, but I couldn™t. See, it was a situation that Œ Q: How did you handle your fear when you were doing something like this? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 60A: I [indecipherable] no fear. Q: How is it you had no fear? A: Well, it Œ it didn™t bother me, I Œ I Œ the only thing was Œ I was Œ wanted it to do, is to kill Germans, and my role was to destroy them. They destroy me. I remember my father used to say, if somebody will be alive, remember what they did to us. And after they killed my father, I was [indecipherable] the yeshiva from school. I became a lion, I wasn™t afraid for nothing. Always I used to be the first, jump into the fire like a hell. How many times I had bullets in my Œ in my head, i-in my arms over here [indecipherable]. I Œ I never was wounded, never. Q: Did you ever kill anybody? A: Oh yeah. I had to. I had no choice. Q: This is while you were a partisan. A: I Œ I never kill a Œ a ra Œ a White Russian. If I kill somebody it™s because he wants to kill me. I Œ I kill a partisan too. Q: When was that? A: Because he wanted to kill me. The jealousy on me was so big, that even Jewish people were jealous. Where we go [indecipherable] successful. We were Œ they -- like I told you before, they went to Œ to the ghetto too. We come to the ghetto f-five [indecipherable] he came back. He used to come to the partisans [indecipherable]. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 61So I Œ an-and in their look they™re like Christians, the people who went to the ghetto, people who most Œ I wouldn™t, my nos e, you can see, like a Jew. I said, I am not afraid with my no Œ my Jewish nose, I Œ I™ll go an-and I™ll be Œ I™ll do it. And I Œ I Œ I did. I had mazel, I had mazel. Let™s say I Œ I had mazel. I save a lot of people, I save maybe, I would say 70 to 80 people I Œ I saved out Œ fr-from ghetto to take it out. Q: S-S Œ 70 to 80? A: Yeah [indecipherable] time. Q: Yeah. A: I went maybe five, six times into the ghetto. Q: Mm-hm. A: And all the time Œ all the time I came out perfectly. Whenever they send me to destroy the jer Œ the Germans railroad or bridges, never one man Œ I was always the responsible man for the group, and never somebody hit Œ was hit from my Œ my Œ mine Œ mine people, never. Q: And you were given orders to do these different sabotage? A: Oh, yeah, I Œ I Œ when Œ when the Russians came from Moscow, they teach us how to put mines, how to use arms. So a lo t of people doing it, but you see, is not what is Œ is afraid, he is shaky, he is shameful. And Œ but a lot of people were like Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 62come on, it™s my life, that™s Œ I have to d Œ I have a chance now to take [indecipherable] . I have a chance, do it. But not too many. Not too many, because this was de Œ you know, when you leave your woods, you™re in danger for death. And people were afraid. Probably I di Œ I had Œ I wasn™t smart enough, yeah. Q: Was there any particular experience that was extremely Œ more dangerous than others? A: Oh yeah, it was a time that people have tsinga(ph). The teeth fa Œ start bending and the Œ because we didn™t have salt. Now, I have to get salt, we have to get into the German zone, and the Germans, let™s say two, three kilometer from the Œ from the farms, they used to give them sugar and Œ and salt and Œ and salt, everything. 10 - 15 kilometer deeper they didn™t give nothing, because they want them to die to [indecipherable] partisans. So I took a group. Myself, my cousin Arnold(ph) Sheefis(ph) and Sam Averkovicz(ph) and Davidal(ph) Winarnik (ph) and we went, four guys, young people. We went and we start taking from the ri Œ to a gor Œ we came to a place with Œ very near, maybe two, three kilometer from the Germans. We knock on the door, don™t open the light, give us all the salt you have in the house. Ahh! One more word you killed and the house is going on fire. The lady brings 10 kilograms salt. And from house to house and house to house, I™m think we went to Œ the last house that would have to go back we see, so further from the police. We Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 63came over there with a hundred kilogram. This is shre Œ hi -- heavy for four people, is 25 kilo for each. We came with that, it™s almost morning, we took off the shoes, we start cleaning out the rifles, and we as ked the owner should gi ve us our coffee or tea, something to eat. And we were eating, and no shoes on us. And she said, children, Germans. [indecipherable] a big window, Germans. I said, [indecipherable] fire. We let them come close and [indecipherable] fire to the windows, like this. [makes gunfire sound]. And we jump up and go back house and they open a fire. You know, they™re Œ it Œ it what to shoot. And we took the salt and we [indecipherable] the shoes, and it was winter. So we run away in a Œ in a place where the Œ it was a Œ a wat Œ water, and on top on the water it was like a wooden bridge, and under this was lower places on a lot of branches. Our mazel they didn™t have docks. We went under th e branches, and they come too look for us and they went further and we were sitting freezing all winter day with the salt. In the evening we were so hungry an d Œ and Œ and thirsty and fr om Œ I call it the Œ I Œ I cannot [indecipherable] in English, from [indecipherable] is all, we went out. We stood up, look around, not [indecipherable] we went to the first Christian house, tell them to give us hot soup and give us shoes. He say he hasn™t got no shoes. Give us food, and wa Œ you haven™ t got shoes? I remember I was so mad on him, he said he had no shoes. I caught him like this and I gave him a kn ock. He Œ I pushed him to Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 64the lext Œ next wall. He was running b-bb-b-b-back. Fall down and I put Œ took off his shoes, put them in my sh Œ my feet.

By a Christian [indecipherable] horse. He had two, otherwise we wouldn™t take. We took away the horse and we took a Œ a Œ a cow and put ever ything Œ salt on this and we went to the woods. To Œ we Œ we came hom e, we were heroes. We got salt, ay yi yi yi yi. When th-the commandeer came he said I Œ he kiss me and he says to me, Noah from today on your name is not Noah . Today ma Œ you are Nikolai(ph). This is a little Œ little story but this is very Œ then Œ then th Œ the se cond time I took the same group. And one of the group, the Averkovicz(ph), Sam Averkovicz(ph) has parents in Œ in the woods, a father and a mother from Baranowicze. They told me I should take this group because I am so successful I Œ I should go to find out, because couple partisans were killed Œ [phone ringing, tape break] Œ couple days before, couple partisans went to destroy the railroad an d the electricity and one of our friends, Yakov Press(ph) were killed. When they start cutting the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the column from the electricity to the da Œ Germans put a mine. All of a sudden the mine destroy, and a-a Œ op Œ hi Œ has Œ his head was off. So we took him on the rifles and brought him back to the partis ans. And then they send me, I should find Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 65out who did it. So I went with these three guys. I didn™t want old, I want young kids, what I say is Œ is holy, cause I knew, the young kids, they underst Œ not understand [indecipherable] . Older one thinks, I will not go, I can be afraid, I™ll Œ I find it out very short Œ in the very beginning, and I sa id, that™s it, no Œ just with these ki Œ guys I go. And I came to Matrosov(ph) [indecipherable] but he was a Russian, he came in the first war took, and he Œ he married a White Russia n shi Œ goya and we went to Œ I went over there and I told him, Mr. Matrosov(ph), we got to find out, your neighbors who Œ some of them told to the Germans about the group who went to destroy the railroad and they caught him and they killed him. And the Œ and the Jewish guy with another gun, who went to Œ to destroy the electricity was killed, was too much, you know, for us to take. And he finded out who Œ who Œ who did it, and we went t-to this guy at night, had tw o Œ two chil Œ two daughters, teachers, and a son in the police by Œ by th e Germans. And went to the house, the Œ the dogs start barking and he came out, he was Œ was sure that™s probably policia, so non Œ nobody Œ partisans would come here. I told him to take in the dog, she shouldn™t bark and should be quiet. He said, wh-who are you, police? [indecipherable] we are police from Moscow. [indecipherable] he became red. [indecipherable] n-nothing. And I looks up and he brought his daughters dressed to the table and they give us Œ want to give us a good time, you know. Th ey prepare food. They prepared food and Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 66we ate, and we drink, even enjoy it. And th en I said to him, you see, you did this and this and this and you did this and this through your two daughters. You all three get killed with one bullet. And they put them head to head, three Œ all three of them on the floor, and one bullet destroyed them all three. The older lady, the m Œ his wife start to screaming, so I didn™t want to do it nothing, but we put the whole house on fire with [indecipherable] she get burned anyway. We took away the horse and what we can loaded on the horses, and back again. Paid them off. But many Œ man Œ many things that wasn™t so easy. What I am saying is just ah Œ but this was taking days to do, to figure out everything and be sure that™s you™re doing right, right? So. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman . This is tape two, side B, and we™ve been talking about your experiences with the partisans. A: I forgot to tell you about when we were a group from Bogachev (ph) and then from Bogachev(ph) went to the east. So we were left a group with I would say like maybe a hundred people, 80 people were left. What was happening? Q: Was this Jewish and Russian partisans together? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 67A: Yes, together. That was the time when we were already in Bogachev™s (ph) group. Bogachev(ph) was the commandeer. Q: The Russian commandeer. A: Right. And he decides to go east, why? I told you before that one of the Jewish guys [indecipherable] , his name. Hm. Oh, no, no, no, I have to tell you Œ tell his name. Excuse me a minute, I Œ [tape break] I told you before about eza Œ Eliezer(ph) Lidovsky(ph) , who didn™t want us to leave the ghetto the first Œ he was a older person, had a family in the ghetto and he Œ it was true that he will be the first arriving in the Œ in the Œ in the woods. When he was like second hand by ku Œ Bogachev(ph), he used to tell him to do this and get that, tell him stories with [indecipherable] . But he didn™t do anything good for anybody. So he Œ you Œ he used to say that if he went as a Œ with his face as a goy, and he couldn™t go into the ghetto, how could I go to the ghetto? And we had a little Œ you know, I said to him, I am younger, I am stronger than you, I can do it better than you. He didn™t like it. And when he was such an important ma n but a commandeer, so I was nothing, and h-he wanted to get rid of me somehow, it Œ every Œ every Œ I shouldn™t be in between, you know? So when the Œ the commandeers came in Œ in from Moscow, was a commandeer Muha(ph). Muha (ph) is a fly in Russian. He was telling us, when you go to do someth ing near the Germans, you should know. He gave you a Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 68little speech. This is our land and you should be like a lion. The Germans are nothing. Today they are here. In a month, a half a year, in two years they will be back in Germany, and we will be in our [indecipherable] here. So you Œ he gave you such a impetus to Œ to fight, to do something. And young people my type were very encouraged, you know. So when I used to come and do things and that and that and all the young people used to come to him and say you [indecipherable] you™re doing nothing, look Noah. With a Jewish nose, he Œ he said, he Œ he does everything. So they Œ they wanted to get ri d of me, and they Œ an d they went get rid of me. And they send me out to a group who came near Pinsk, and the commandeer was Igor. Igor, when I came to them was plain Russian, all from Moscow. Moscow, Leningrad Œ Q: Yo-You went Œ you were th e only one to leave to go to Igor? A: I was the only one, in Jewish. And I came over there, I see all of a sudden, three Œ my Œ from my city, three guys, Worlansky(ph) Eller(ph), Worlansky (ph) Simcha(ph), and Worlansky (ph) Abrusha (ph) the youngster, my friend. When I saw them, they said, Noah, where you come from? I said, my group send me over here. I Œ he Œ they said, what you gonna do? I said, we™re gonna go to destroy the Œ the railroad here. They said, we have so many people, they know everything. I said, I know, too. They said, how do you know? I said, I am already a year and a half in Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 69the partisans, it™s time to learn. They just came, they were just new-coming from Œ they were [indecipherable] in a Œ in a place hid Œ hide Œ hiding. Okay. Over there was groups, 12 - 15 people groups, and th e commandeer was a Russian officer and the rest was all Russians. And they took us, me and the hi Œ the younger, Abrusha (ph), my friend to the same group. An d we went at night. They give us clothes forsta Œ first of all and machine guns, and good, everything perfect, to be dressed like a mensch with grenade, with a pistol, with Œ like a mensch you dressed, and got arms. They give you a little education what you can do, and which bombs you have to put under Œ under the railroad. So we came out, over there was five people sitting behind a water. Water was up Œ water was he Œ to here. So the Germans never thought that we™ll be going seven kilometer into the Œ into the swamp to here to destroy the railroads. So th ey Œ they left this Œ this zone open. We came over there vert Œ [indecipherable] seven kilometer at ni ght to go, you know, and I was short so I had to go with two shtettins I shouldn™t fall in. We came on the other side, we were like fi-five people, the communists said, Noah [indecipherable] Baloja (ph), you both go to put the mines. Baloja(ph) said to the commandeer, him, he™s Jewish, he doesn™t know ho-how to pu t mines. I™m not going. So he says, step away, right away. In Russia there™s not such a thing you™re not going. So he said, who wants to go? And my friend Abrusha (ph), he Œ he Œ I™m going with Noah. So Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 70we went both, we put on the mine, you kn ow, we had to dig out the hole, put the mine deep that they smell th Œ from the dogs , the dogs shouldn™t be able to smell it. Put a metal like a half a meter deep. When the railroad come and just a little critch is up in the air. We did it, came back and now Œ in couple hours after they left the Œ the swamps, boom [indecipherable]. So the Œ the Russian came to me, he said I™m sorry, I didn™t know you know how t Œ how to Œ how to Œ the Œ they say Jewish people don™t know how to fight. I say, well you™re right, Jewish people don™t know. What they don™t know, they know. [indecipherable] instead. And I was there with them fighting every night, some other place, some other place, some other place. Not fighting with guns, with Œ with pistol s, just bombs and bombs and bombs. We destroy them like dogs every night a Œ a Œ a Œ a transport, every night a transport. You know what it is, night Œ arms we had, how much we want. Food, the best. It was sitting a whole week every day, then we went back to the grou Œ to the [indecipherable] near Pinsk. Come there, change clothes, the best shower in the world. Food is unbelievable, the cook was from Hungary [indecipherable] in Œ in order to cook good food for the commandeer. Q: Ho-How big a group was this Pinsk group? A: We were like probably about a hundred people. Q: Were there Œ were there women in the group? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 71A: No, not one. The commandeer [indecipherable] to have it, the cook and [indecipherable] was men. Q: What was the role of the women in your previous partisan Œ A: They used to clean the pot Œ potatoes, wash clothes for the men. They have lot to do, it was a Œ a big group, couple hundred men to Œ to provide with Œ with the Œ clean everything and it was what to do. And then, even my wife, you can ask her, she was on post. Took a rifle an-and Œ and to watch, but they close the p Œ not the post near the officers, you know, not Œ not far away, far away just Œ just men. Q: How was your health during all this, your physical condition? A: Nobody was sick. The sick ova Œ be come healthy. Sick people from ghetto become healthy in Œ in the partisans. Q: Was there medical attention though, there? A: Yes, yes, it had everything. It™s not per-perfect [indecipherable] but we had. Let™s say if y Œ if you needed [indecipherable] saw a regular doctor break [indecipherable] in order to take the [indecipherable] it was Œ things like this happen, many things. Q: So you™re now in Œ in Pinsk, any other stories about the partisans in Pinsk? A: Over there Œ over there we were until December 1943. In 1943 we had a pricass(ph). It means you have to go and meet the Russian army, the Russian army Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 72needs you. We haven™t too much Œ too many partisans, because the Œ the Œ the Germans going back to Germany, to Poland, right, and is no room for the partisans, so it™s enough the older peop le should stay and watch the Germans shouldn™t get in Œ into the woods. Because the Germans will t Œ take it over. Ukrainians, Lithuanians, no, th ey are all who work for the SS, you know? And the younger people had to go on the front. So when we came to a place in whi Œ in White Russia , when we met Œ when we went out from the woods, we had a Œ a garmonika playing music , we knew we Œ we met Œ we met in the Russian army soon. This was near Slutsk. We came from Pinsk to Slutsk, you know? Q: Wh-When you were in the Pinsk partisans, did you still have any relationship with your first partisan group? A: No. I had no Œ no Œ no Œ no ki Œ Q: Connection, or Œ A: No connections, no connections becaus e the pi Œ the only people who had met each other on groups, on Œ on Œ on Œ on places they used to meet each other, maybe destroying things or we™re buying food, or m Œ something like that they could see each other, otherwise nobody would Œ you Œ you Œ you Œ you shouldn™t see it, because no group was wanted Œ interested you should know what™s going on in the other one. Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 73Q: Did they Œ did the underground group in Œ the partisan group from Pinsk talk about what happened in Pinsk? A: We couldn™t speak of it to nobody about political or about anything else. Only one thing, whenever we have time you Œ you had Œ you had a we ek, you have to go out, destroy a whole week, every night. Then you come for a week vacation. In the week you eat, you sleep, and you learn th e new a-arms what they send you from Moscow, all kind. And airplanes come every Œ every two weeks, every two weeks the airplanes, Russia. We used to make a fire, fi-fires and the Russian [indecipherable] Q: And they would drop supplies? A: Oh they Œ he just come the airplane down. Q: The airplane would come down? A: Yeah, yeah, we built like aerodrome. Q: And then they would Œ A: It was Œ it wasn™t so simple, it was very hard. Most of the t Œ of the time they used to drop, but many times they were afraid to go back because they knew that the fire from the Germans was terrible, and if they went back they were killed. Q: Did you ge Œ g Œ when yo u were in these partisan brigades, did you always go by your name? Your Œ your fi rst and second name, or di d you have another name? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 74A: Oh yeah, they Œ they used to call me Nikolai(ph) because they jokingly say Noah is a Jewish name, you™re not a Jew, you™re not a Jew, you™re Œ Roitman is a Œ is a German, and Noah is good, and Nikolai(ph) is better. Q: And so your Œ obviously your Russian language skills were excellent. A: No, they™re not excellent. I Œ I Œ I Œ I didn™t went to school when I was eight and 12 - 15. Only when the Russi an came, it wa Œ I Œ I was from 19 Œ I Œ I knew Polish good, but Russian, I didn't learn Russian because I hated communism. I didn™t learn English Œ English because I hated British because what they did in Eretz Israel. Is not a Œ not a joke. I™m telling you. Not all of them, not all of my friends like this, I was like this. My family is very [indecipherable] Zionism. This was Œ Israel was all of it. So i Œ I Œ if I didn™t like this, I didn™t learn. It was a big mistake, right? Q: But you had to communicat e when you were in the partisans in Russian, right? A: Oh, I Œ I knew how to read and to do everything, but not in a grade, you know. I was two years in school, after all. Young people two years learn in school they know, but I didn™t know enough. I Œ I mean, I wanted to be engineer, to learn. I Œ I would study later on, after the war. But it didn™t work out, I decide to run away. I don™t want to do engineering, I don™t wa nt to do language, I want to go home. But home is Eretz Israel. [indecipherable] in ™46 already. Q: Okay. So now it™s December ™43, and you said that Œ Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 75A: ™43, and then we Œ we went and with the Russian army in Krasny (ph) Baraki (ph). Krasny(ph) Baraki (ph) is between Slutsk and another city don™t Œ I don™t know exactly, but was Œ was a to Œ a little place. And when they saw us they took me right away to the army. We had to give up the rifles, give up the grenade [indecipherable] . And they took us in with the clothes and didn™t give us clothes. They took me in a field, a lot of woods, and we had to dig a ditch, right? We dig out the ditch, this was the Œ like a side Œ the sidewalk, on both side was dirt, that was the place to sleep. No clothes, not Œ with nothing, just the clothes that came up from your boots. We were hungry and depressed. Just all day long, right, left, ri Œ kill [indecipherable] you know, they teaching us all the Œ this Œ like o-on the front. Q: And how many were there in your group of partisans in Œ A: Oh, [indecipherable] partisans, we Œ in our place Œ in our place where we came, we were couple hundred. And then come thousands and thousands and thousands came every Œ every hour to the army, cause this is Œ this is central point from here. All of a sudden ki Œ one somebody ca Œ co Œ one Œ one guy of the Œ from the Œ the army came, he said, where is Nikolai(ph) Roitman ? I said, me. He Œ officer Bilmis(ph) wants to talk Œ talk to you. Bilmis(ph)? I said to myself, Jewish? Now Jewish Bilmis(ph)? I came over there [indecipherable] sit down. You have no Œ more Jews over here? I said yeah. Wolansky™s(ph) a Jew, Hamut(ph) is a Jew. Jew Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 76Œ these Jews, bring them all to me. I bring all the [indecipherable] my close friends. They Œ he ed Œ he made us food, we ate, we take a re Œ took a rest and Œ and he was such a geshmak (ph), such a nahas (ph). I™m telling you, he Œ he Œ our morale was to the sky. And nothing to worry, he says, from no Œ now I™ll take ca re of you. And he did. One day the Russian army decide that al l officers got to know how to dance, but dancing to ge Œ to Germany, in Germany everybody is kultura(ph). They cult Œ culta Œ kultura(ph) , so people in Russia, they are not, everybody. So we went for dancing in Russia, in Œ in Œ in the Krasny(ph) Baraki (ph), in the place. We all came to see what the Œ how the officers dancing, just officers. And all of a sudden some Ukrainian about something, start with Œ with this [indecipherable] of mine, my friend, my Bilmis(ph) and he told him Œ I said, this is this and then he said to him Œ to the je Œ to the Bilmis(ph), you are parshiva(ph) Jew. You are pig Œ pig Jew. He took the pistol out and he [indecipherable] just shot him on Œ on the place. Everybody was Œ Bilmis(ph) such a officer, such a quiet, such a intelligent. He said, I couldn™t take it. I can see my friends all di e in the part Œ in the partisans and in the ghettoes and a Ukrainian like this, who worked together with the Germans, he™s [indecipherable] he™ll told me I am a dirty Jew, he cannot live any more on this world [indecipherable] The general Œ the general came, he said, [indecipherable] Bilmis [speaks Russian] friend, what punishment you want? He said, send me on Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 77the front. He said, you got it. Normally, he said, we killing. You should be killed. And he send him [indecipherable] by Berlin if he Œ there was Œ he was killed. Was a big tragedy for all of us because he said, when the war will be over, we™ll all meet together and we™ll go [indecipherable] to Israel. And that™s aft Œ in the Œ I was, and that™s the way we Œ we went on the front. I went to artillery on the front, and they se Œ they send me on a course, on this place where I was, I was on a course for a couple of weeks to learn artillery. It™s a minamyot(ph), you know what minamyot (ph) and artill Œ artillery too. I learn so good, I knew it, I was proud of myself that I learned the way it should be . And I became a sergeant and they send me on the front. Send me on the front to white rush Œ to shuko(ph) White Russian Œ first White Russian front. I came into a place, my general was Plachin (ph), my commandeer was 99 Guardia(ph) artilleriskipolk (ph) and I was Sergeant Roitman on the third battery. And since then I fought with all of them until we came to Berlin. But in between, when we be Œ di dn™t fight, we had to go out, three or four people from each cannon and go and get prisoners of Germans. Sometime we did, sometime we didn™t, yeah. Sometime they killed us, sometime we killed them. And one place Œ we came to a place, ot -- Ottertoti (ph) Berlin, we saw we Œ the Germans at Œ attack here back again. They instead Œ Russian attack Œ attack all the time, but they some Œ somehow a group of Germans start attack sho Œ attack the Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 78Russian art Œ infantry. And they caught a group, they put all these, they call it Œ Q: Belt? A: Belts to each other and to the hand, to the each other and they killed them out. And we came, we Œ we saw the Germans r unning and we open fire. We killed them all, not one was left. So it was a big tragedy. Here the Œ th-the 50 - 60 Germans just killed maybe Œ maybe a hundred Russians in Œ in Œ in a minute. And over here we came and we di Œ killed the Œ the Œ the Germans. But what Œ what the Germans where we ki Œ there were so many Russian were killed. So when the army came, the officers tell me everybody was crying lik e children. Why, oh, thought this Berlin ready, the last minute we Œ we get such a [indecipherable] they Œ they killed so many people. It was unbelievable, they coul dn™t take it. And then, from then on until we came to Berlin, we didn™t left one German alive, not one. We had oth-other undefe Œ und Œ un Œ under Œ un Œ u-u-under our feet Germans and Russian, are mixed, th Œ because the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the Œ the fight was so intense and the artillery of the Russian was giving fire [indecipherable] and bombs that i-it was a Œ you couldn™t see anything, like rain before you. And whatever we saw is Œ was mixed up, until we came to Berlin. We came to Berlin, a commandeer came over, he said Noah, now you see you Œ you have to go. Where I have to go? He said. You take one cannon with 10 people and we™ll push you on the ropes, because the trucks Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 79cannot go in. The fire is in Œ unbelievable. Q: Before you Œ before we get to Berlin, did you see any Œ did you come across any camps, any labor camps? A: Yeah, it was in Lódz when we were on the Wiesel(ph) Œ on the Wisla. Wisla near Warsaw. W-We were standing there for mont hs, and then we pushed and we went back to Lódz to see because we Œ we knew they still had the Jewish people over there. And in Warsaw we saw was everything dest royed. And from there wh Œ by the way w-we went to Œ to Berlin, we came to a Œ to the water in the Œ the other [indecipherable] is like this and the Warta is like this, two waters go [indecipherable] . And we Œ we Œ we Œ and we had to go over on the other side in order to stop the ger Œ the Germans, they shouldn™t be able to Œ to go Œ to go the bridge. All night long we build the bridges, you know, pontoo n bridges under the water. And we took lines, like oil, so the tanks can see the Œ the lines oil, how to get on Œ on the bridge, because everything™s under the water. And we came with our truck, a GMC, American GMC and our cannon, 105 millimeter Howitz (ph), and we were sitting on Œ and Œ and going through and all of a sudden Germans came and started bombing. And all the bridge was colla psed and our truck is in the water and me and one another guy ju-jump out from Œ on top of the water was a piece of ice, you know? This was 1945 already, maybe in February, March. And we were sitting Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 80on the Œ on the piece Œ on the Œ on the ice, and we running with the rifles wet, back to Küstrin where the Germans are. I said it Œ I am not going, I am jumping. And I start jumping from one piece of ice to the other Œ to the other with the big clothes on yourself and somehow the energy made it I should be able to come on the other side, and we came alive, two of us. When we came on the other side they didn™t believe we are alive because everybody is under the water already. Q: As you were on the move, di d you see any Jewish refugees? A: Yes, I saw. Q: Did you talk to them? A: I talk. Q: And what Œ what did you talk about? A: Oh you Œ we talk that i-if they can be alive another day or two, and we shouldn™t Œ they Œ they Œ they were a fraid to Œ to eat too much, because the American in some places they didn™t give them nothing, in some places they give them chocolate. The Russians were better, I™m telling you, the Ru ssian gave them soup. Skinny, not that fat, just to Œ to Œ little by little, not too much, so they Œ they [indecipherable] Q: Did you know anything ab out the camps at that time? A: Yeah, sure we knew. We knew everything. Q: How did you know? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 81A: Because the trou Œ Russian propaganda was Œ was telling us everything. Telling every Œ we used to hear news three, four times a day. Q: And you heard of a place called Auschwitz? A: Sure. Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka. And we knew that this probably happened to Jews and the Russians, because they will not take American or British over there, that what we knew. Because all the time we had a Œ a [indecipherable] we were afraid that one day [indecipherable] the American and the British will at-attack us. It was almost [indecipherable] said, the American going to Œ to Œ to attack us, maybe a day or two or three, it was very close to it. I don™t know why it did not happen, but it was on the agenda in Œ in Œ in Germany , before we took Berlin, because the Russian wanted to press so hard, kill how many Russians and Germans together, just to be the first in Berlin. And they did. And we have to be the first, we have to be the first and push and push. This what I™m telling you is nothing. If I would tell you stories how many days and nights we didn™t sleep, we didn™t eat, we had to fight and fight. Some places we had hills, where the Germans give us fire hell. We couldn™t go up the hill. We have to shot for days, you know, in order to get through to these places, because the Germans were so defendable. They had [indecipherable] arms, and Œ and Œ and good soldiers. Q: When you were fighting the Germans, were you fighting as a Jew, or were you Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 82fighting as a Russian soldier? A: Well, in my heart I was a Jew, but with the clothes and everything, he Œ I was a Russian soldier, of course. I couldn™t say Œ say Œ when Œ when I f Œ when I get the Germans prisoners. So I tell them [speaks German]. He never responded, he never say anything. He thought I am going to kill him a lot. I didn™t touch him, I didn™t do nothing to him because I had a order not to do anything. To kill, somebody else will kill him, but not me.

And then I came, say, I would Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 94like my friend Shika(ph) Mykohn (ph), he is Jewish, I want him to come with me. Why? I said, because the Polacks is sh Œ har Œ killing Jews and the Russian. Oh, yeah, good idea. And he let me go w ith him. Then we come to Œ to Poland . And instead to go to Baranowicze, to see what™s going on there, right, first of all I was in 1943 as a partisan I was there, so I knew what the Œ our house is th Œ and the people are killed, is Œ is nothing special for me to see. And whatever I could see is to see her and oth-other friends who Œ who are alive. But to me Œ to me was more important to take Jewish people from Poland and bring them over to Czechoslovakia, because I had two months passporten(ph). I was sitting with loc-locomotive with the Polacks, give them 10,000 zlotys , which was a hundred dollars maybe. Man Œ money I have, bigger than me. And I spend the money to bring Jews from Poland to Œ to Œ to Czechoslovakia. After they caught me, the Russian caught me. Q: Ho-How did you find these Jews? A: Oh, in every city, in the Œ was the centers from Jews who came from the concentration camp, from Russia, from Œ from partisans, th Œ everybody wants to go to Israel.

But th ey knew everything, they speak all languages and they knew how to co-comm unicate, right? And they to Œ worked very, very well, very well. Q: And so your role was to do what ? What was your role at that time? A: My role is to just take out pe-people from Poland to Œ to Œ to Œ to Œ to Czechoslovakia . Q: And did you go with them? A: I go in the front with the locomotives so the Russians should see a Russian, they will not stop him, you know. Or the Czechs or the Polacks. But the m Œ and then [indecipherable] Q: So you went back and forth? A: Back and forth, and then they caught me. They caught me and put me in jail, the Russians. And I got 15 years severe. Q: Okay, before we get to that, when the war was over, what did you feel like? What were your thoughts and what were your feelings when you realized that the Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 96war Œ A: Ah [indecipherable].

Who is gonna see a Jew is gonn a say oh, we got to keep him, we got to watch him, we got to respect him, we got to thank him he is Œ is alive. But it™s not like this. You see, the whole pi Œ the whole politic is against the Jews anyway right Œ right after the war. So, I would never believe this will happen, but that™s what happen. And then after we Œ I c Œ we came to Israel in 1946 and th-they Œ they took us back to ca Œ C-Cyprus, right. Q: Yeah, we™ll talk about th at. Okay, so now you said yo u were escorting these Jews to Czechoslovakia, but you were caught. Q: And the Œ and the Œ and they caught me and they took me to Oranerburger (ph) Strasse 10, in Berlin. And they put me in jail with Nazis, Ukrainians, couple hundred people on the sixth floor. Q: They being the Russians? A: The Russians. When the Russian caught me and they thought I am gonna run away. So one was Jewish, and the rest was NKVD , NKVD, the Russian. So the Jew got tol Œ ta Œ talked to me like this. [speaks foreign language] and you™ll never be smarter than me. I™ll put you in jail. And they grabbed my hand like behind my Œ my back. They put me in Œ in katen (ph), you know, in steel, in metal. And they put Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 97me in a car, they throw me in, Oranienburger Strasse 10 in Germany, and they put me in jail. Three days and three nights I was sitting staring straight Œ not sitting, standing. No air, excuse me, and no toilet, no nothing. Three days, 72 hours like this. Q: Because they thought you were gonna desert? A: Yeah, they thought they go Œ I™m gonna go [indecipherable] to the Americas, and th Œ and Œ from the Russian army.

I said to him, I am Jewish, I am wounded May 5 th, 1945 from the Germans and you don™ t tell me I am fascist. Don™t talk to me like that. I said, I am not a fraid for you stomping your f Œ your feet like that. I fought for myself. I am deserving something better than this. Not you should Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 98talk to me like that. Take him out, this dog, take him out. Took me out. Took me out a little truck, and then come out two, three other people, and between the other three was one Meyer (ph) Boldusov (ph). Meyer(ph) Boldusov (ph). He wasn™t Jewish, he was Russian. And he says, when you were answering this, so I was behind you, and I heard everything. You good, he says to me. You™re not afraid for them. I said, what can they do, more than severe, what can they do more? He says to me, I am officer, a major in the army. And in Berlin I couldn™t do whatever they Œ they told me do this and this and this and I couldn™ t do it exactly what they wanted from me. So after two days in fighting with the Germans, they told me that I didn™t fill out the Œ the Œ he didn™t do it hundred percent [indecipherable] and they put him in jail [indecipherable] and he got 10 years severe. Now we were sitting in the truck, in th Œ behind the truck, in the Œ in the front is a officer and our driver.

And we went into the railroad, to the wagons, yeah. An d Œ and Œ and the railroad is running.

I used to write poems and I write a book, was 700 pages. And because I wasn™t [indecipherable] Israel, so I keep the book because they said everybody who Œ who had ma terial, you should keep Œ we should know in the future, and they took it away and never returned me. Q: This was a book ab out your experiences? A: Mm-hm. I wrote it from the partisans and the Russian army and th Œ Israel, and they took it away.

And my daughter, my older [indecipherable] the older, she says to me, why I don™t have uncles and Œ and this and this and that? Fa Œ one, two, three times? What can you tell her? So instead to tell her the stories what we went through, we decide not to tell her. After many, many years she didn™t even ask. We wi Œ decide she will grow up, she [indecipherable] and then we™re gonna tell her, and she understand better. And that was a mistake, should be Œ we should tell her, we had to tell her.

If you th-think about physically, emotionally, it wasn™t so [indecipherable] , it wasn™t so easy. You had to th ink about it and then say, I don™t want to know about it. I have to continue living. I have to go and Œ go and kill or to get killed. I-Is Œ is thi Œ is Œ is this a life? I-Is this easy to say about it? When you™re living in Œ in the woods and they call you up at night, say now you have to go. You know, when you leave this place, finish every Œ every Œ every minute you can get killed.

And they were so surprised that they Œ they couldn™t schlep the Œ the hand grenades and the [indecipherable], they took off the Œ the pants a Œ a Œ they should be able to run. And that™s the way they run into the woods, nobody ever get them out [indecipherable] . You know what Œ what a Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 119feeling this is?

Many, many years I didn™t do anything, I didn™t want it. Q: Why didn™t you want to? A: Because I had a feeling, let™s say I™m gonna do it, what Œ what Œ what Œ what Œ what I am accomplishing?

I know f-for our hundreds of people, we had 20 - 30 people that really fighters, were these fighters, fire. And that™s enough, you didn™t need any more, right, cause you didn™t need any more. But most of the people are not fighters. Q: What are your feelings about Germany today? A: I Œ I Œ I cannot say nothing good about Poland, nor about Germany. About Poland or Germany I had nothing to say, because they Œ I would say actually, I should, the Œ the Polacks are worse than the Germans. Do we agree? Would you agree? Q: It™s your discussion today. A: I Œ I Œ I would say ma-many Germans I know, who wanted to help, they did Œ they did help. And Polacks if they did so mething, it™s just for money, right, and again for money and for Œ for Œ many for Œ fo r good things for themselves, not Œ not Œ not f Œ to be proud men. Yeah, yeah, here and there, one or two or three, but very little. Look, the Jews [indecipherable] half a million Jews, two million Jews maybe [indecipherable] right? You had in Poland, they had two million people sh-shoot Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 121the [indecipherable] Jews, right? Six million Jews in Poland, 35 million Polacks. No, you haven™t Œ you didn™t have a Œ even hundred thousand good people, no way. Q: Politically, do you think that in today™s world your views are influenced by what you went through? A: I don™t think so. I Œ I don™t think the world is thinking about Jews at all. Q: Do you think the world has le arned any lessons from the war? A: I think the Jews didn™t learn nothing, ho w can the Œ the Œ the others learn? By my grandchildren asking me, Saba, do you think in America can happen that™s what happen in Germany? I said, of course. What? I said, of course, there no question about it. And this will [indecipherable] shouldn™t happen. I think just in America will this happen. Never, Saba. Here you got so many, we got Jews, we got blacks, we got Ukrainians, you got the Polacks, you got Germans. I said, they all the same goy. The Jews are different. Since [indecipherable] until today, we are different. And they see us as difference. Secondly, they see the Jews all rich. Go to work and see how many hundreds have no Œ no Œ no food in the house. Th Œ somebody [indecipherable] over there? Tell me Saba. Saba, the Jews are not poor. My grandchildren. So what I have to say, huh? What do I have to s Œ what do I have to say? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 122Q: When you looked at Œ look at the picture in today™s news about Kosovo and you see refugees, does it bother you? A: [indecipherable] bothers me very much those people had something like that. And I don™t think so the president of ours should do something like that. First of all, they [indecipherable] have the Americans and the Jews in the World War II. And they the same Christian like the Americans. Our president is a Arab, excuse me for the expression. He does Œ he does ever ything what good for Arabs. He press Israel because the Arabs. His wife is pro-Arabic, everybody knows that. He is the same thing. He thinks he™s a smart man, he got a brains because God give him a chance that the business is good, e-everything wo rks for him like even if we do something wrong. Then secondly , look, we got 67 percent Americans, and even Jews 67 percent who voted for him. I vote for hi m too, because I didn™t like the way Bush Œ Bush™s way with the handling in the Middle East. But I can™t understand after such a wars Œ after the second war, Vietnam, Korea , all over the world, people should be so left-handed for the President Clinton. I see what™s going on, I Œ I Œ I™m shocked. I™m shocked. In Israel the same thing [indecipherable] . Q: You were making a distinc tion about what you did in the partisans did and what other people did. Why do you think you were the type that had the ability to fight back and the strength and the courage? Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 123A: Other people had [indecipherable] but they didn't have the courage. Q: Why did you have the courage? A: I don™t know, I wasn™t afraid. It™s not just I wasn™t afraid, m-my love to my father, I think, to my family was so great, that I felt when I go to do something, to destroy something, I had a feeling that my father is holding his head Œ his hand on my head, and he™s telling me how to turn. Serious. And I used to say, maybe this is the reason. In Germany, in Berlin, I had a bullet in Œ in my casket. So I said [indecipherable] all the years I wanted to be tall like my brother, and I am a short man like my savta. See, if I will be tall, I would be killed. So I should be tall Œ short and happy. So Œ so there™s the answer, what can you say? I™m right, you see. So you see, there is no answer to many questions, like m-my Œ my kinder will Œ will ask me, Aba, how can you be religious when you saw everything what™s happen? I said to her, look, I became religious 20 years ago when I saw you and your children don™t go to shul and don™t eat kosher and you don™t watch Shabba s, and this way my other daughter, look Œ look Œ look the di fferent. Look Œ look your sister. Friday night to shul, the children sitting with father, Shabbas Œ Shabbas [indecipherable]. She has nothing to say, but she always say, how could God do so mething like that to my grandfather? You™re telling your father was such a special man. I said, well maybe everybody said that his father wa s a special, but I know my father was a Interview with Noah Roitman April 8, 1999 124special, because if he had to learn something from mathematics or [indecipherable] , everybody come to my house. I didn't go to Œ to Œ to somebody™s house. So it™s a fact that my father was smart, right? Hm, Aba, you got Œ you got s Œ you got something here. Look , look my grandchildren, look, I tell her. She said, you™re right. My grandchildren learning, i-it™s some Œ it™s no-nothing in the world is hard for them. See what it Œ what it means? Q: Is there anything else you wanted to add that we haven™t talked about? A: I Œ I Œ I would ask Œ I would add that you are a great lady. If you can come today and do it, otherwise I wouldn™t do it. So I would very proud that we will meet some other time and we™ll enjoy in really good times and say hey, we got better years, better times and we Œ we should have shalom in Israel, and you shouldn™t have to do something like that, do something, better things. Nice to meet you, it™s a pleasure. Q: That was a good note to end on. This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Noah Roitman.
