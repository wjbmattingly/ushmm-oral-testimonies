But he was also sent there because of this, that somehow, you know, they knew where Œ they always took people for nothing, they put them somewhere, for no reason at all, sometimes good places, sometimes the good pla Œ some the worst places. I remember one day I couldn™t go to work. Was so cold, I couldn™t work. I said to myself, this time I™m not going to go to work. So I went out, I had to go to the toilet, whatever, it was outside. And he saw me, Dolgapolof (ph) and he told me to come over, so I went over to him. He says to me, why don™t you work? I said, I wa Œ I™m very cold, and I™m 15 years old, and the law says about 15 years old, I don™t have to work. What™s your name? So I told him the name, and took a red pencil, and make a mark there.

Q: Were people Œ did anybody die from hunger? A: This is a good question. Nobody died, only one old man died. But if you would stay there a little longer, it started up already, because we sold everything from us, which we have. There was always a black market somehow. And they sold, you know, we had pants, nice pants, so we made different pants and this and that. My father knew how to [indecipherable] with this. But we didn™t have nothing to sell any more. And not only we, but everybody. If would stay another year, there would be a lot of casualties, a lot.
