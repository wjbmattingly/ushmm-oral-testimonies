3 >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: So you were born at a time when at your birth your parents had a secure existence, their parents and grandparents had been in then Germany for decades and you are born into a world that changed rapidly. And by the time you were in school, in 1935 -36, a whole new set of regulations was in place. What was it like on a day -to-day basis in school for you? I know Jewish children were separated from non -Jewish children. >> Frank Liebermann: Well, we had basically three classrooms within the school, separate teachers. The most dangerous part of the school day was recess, which was around noon. We had to go outside. And more or less the safest area where we could go was the dividing line between the boys and the girls who were separated on the playground. And there we had our teachers more or less keeping order. We did get out five minutes early so that we could rush home before the rest of the school got out. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Do you remember anything about your neighbors and how they treated you and your family in these difficult years of the `30s? >> Frank Liebermann: Not really. Because we were on the first floor -- or what is the second floor. The neighbors would be upstairs. I had no neighbor experience that way since I mentioned we lived downtown. Downtown isn't like living in the suburbs where you know your neighbors. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And the other Jewish fa milies in Gliwice, did they liv e nearby? >> Frank Liebermann: It wasn't that big a city. We had a group of about eight families who shared what was called a [indiscernible] garden which is a plot of garden maybe half an acre which was our safe playground. We had cherry trees, pear tree. That was a place where we went on weekends or after school. It was a place where you could take an easy bike ride. That was kind of a safe haven. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Do you remember when your parents first started talking about trying to emigrate? >> Frank Liebermann: My mother took a trip to Israel in 1936 w ith her brother, found out that in Israel there's one doctor for every 100 people . And people with education, physicians particularly, were working on chicken farms because there was no way that he could continue in his profession. We started to investigate elsewhere b ecause after 1936 we had warnings that we have to make a change. In fact, before the end of the treaty, which I believe was in July, my parents had me go to the swim ming pool to take swimming lessons because there was a strong possibility we would take an ocean voyage and they wanted me to learn how to swim , which I did. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: So your parents already, by 1936, were investigating possibilities. An d what about the rest of your family at that time? >> Frank Liebermann: I mentioned before they felt so secure. They survived starv ation in World War I with some bartering because they sold leather goods to farmers. And the other ones would say we don't want to be burdened. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And your father, when did he lose the ability to practice medicine? >> Frank Liebermann: They started having blockades of the so -called SR which were kind of beer hall Nazis when Hitler took over , as soon as the treaty was over. His practice went down very substantially, also lost his hospital privileges as a surgeon. So he was still taking care of some people who chose to come but the SR people were threatening any non -Jews with employment threats, that they would tell their bosses and there would be consequences. My grandparents' business went down from that time from about 100,000 marks, which was at that time substantial, to about 20 when the business was confiscated during Kristallnacht. They had a non-Jewish accountant who kept the records, which, by the way, is in the museum files. I donated those. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And we're lucky you did. Your father took a trip to the United States in June 1938. Do you want to tell us about that? >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. My grandfather did a genealogy study for my parents and found that a distant cousin, not that distant but goes back a generation before, emigrated to the United States in 1905. And we also had a history of another family, emigrate d to the United States -- rather, to the 4 colonies in the middle 1700s and were a pretty leading family in Philadelphia. A book was written about the family and the college. So he went to the archives in Philadelphia to see if there was any family who could help. Unfortunately Rebecca never married and her brother emigrated -- rather, went west to Louisville and lost track. There was no -- so the expedition to Philadelphia was a bust. But he did find a son of the person who left, who had a substantial job in New York and who eventually gave us an affidavit. That's how we got to the United States. He brought that back. An affidavit is a signed document that we would not be on welfare for one year after arrival. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And the quota was quite small. >> Frank Liebermann: 25,000. It was rarely filled. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Terrible. Your father went to the United States in June 1938. You and your mother -- >> Frank Liebermann: No. He went in January. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: In January. Ok. >> Frank Liebermann: At that point we got a number from the State Department to be eligible for the quota in 1938. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And you and your mother followed in October. So there was this gap where your father was in the United States and you and your mother were still in Gliwice with conditions worsening all the time. >> Frank Liebermann: Well, we got our visa in the end of June 1938. My father took the next boat because all money -- all bank accounts were frozen. You could only withdraw enough to prove for living expenses. It was illegal to take any money out except for 10 marks, which is about $2.50. By today's inflation figures, I put that as $50. In order to live -- if you took a German ship, you were able to get a pretty good spending allowance on the ship which could then be transferred out. We used that for living expenses. The visa was good for 120 days. We purposely booked it after three and a half months so that we had some money to live on when we arr ived. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Was your mother afraid? Were you afraid? >> Frank Liebermann: Fear wasn't an option. If you decide to do something, you do it. Both parents made up their mind and we had to do whatever we had to do. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I remember reading about a medical incident that you had when your father was already in the United States and you were back with your mother. Do you want to mention that to the audience, and what being Jewish meant in that situation? >> Frank Liebermann: In playing, there was a building which we could use. I took my bicycle to it and we were playing tag. I fell. I broke my arm. Or at least I fell and it hurt. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: So there was no way of calling anybody, like the police or 911. I took my bicycle and rode home this way, made it, fortunately. My mother immediately called the orthopedist at the hospital and was told, sorry, he isn't treating any Jewish people and he can't help. She frantically got on the phone and found an orthopedist in my grandparent's town in Boynton , my father's parents who, by the way, were no longer living there. He said we should take a taxi to the Catholic orphanage at the edge of town and take the freight -- the delivery entrance. He would meet us there. He checked the arm and gave instructions to my pediatrician on what exercises to do after I think six weeks, after the cast came off. That way that was taken care of. My left arm is fine. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Your poor mother with that first response. So in October 1938, you and your mother boarded a ship for the United States. Can you tell us about your voyage? >> Frank Liebermann: We took the Europa, which was one of two ships. We had a cabin way in the front because we took the cheapest cabin in first class in order to get the spending allowance. When we got to Bremen, there was no ship. We were told the ship would arrive the next day. We did board. We stayed overnight. And when we got on the ship, we found out th at during the Munich negotiations when England and France sold the Czech Republic down the river without their consent and gave away 5 the border area with Germany, Hitler called back all ships at sea as part of a war threat and the ship was called back and was four days late in September. By October it made up three of the days. And we were the last one. The ship took six days to cross the Atlantic and one day to turn around. So it caught up and we made the ship in October during the hurricane season w here my mother was terribly seasick, also probably also emotional exhaustion. At one point I was one of six people in the dining room. The other five sat at the captain's table. I had a table for myself , which I thought was great. >> [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Before we leave Germany altogether in your story, what is your best memory and your worst memory prior to getting on that ship in October 1938? >> Frank Liebermann: My best memory was probably my mother's family were expert mushroom pickers. And they did this on a yearly basis, going to the country to a particular forest. I have no idea where it was. And at the end of the picking they took everything home. It was spread out on the table. And anybody had veto power on every one of the mushrooms. As you know, there are many different varieties. And anyone vetoed they weren't eaten. And my grandmother made wonderful feasts with the mushroom crop. Worst memory probably is when my mother's brother came with us to Bremen and I saw him caught . >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And you were 9 years old at the time. >> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And where did you land in the United States? >> Frank Liebermann: New York. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And was your father the re? >> Frank Liebermann: My father picked us up. He had come to New York by Greyhound. I got a sightseeing tour on a two double -decker 5th Avenue bus which showed me C entral Park, the Upper West Side. We stayed two days. And then we took the empire state express to Cleveland where he had rented a one -bedroom apartment where I had a Murphy bed. I don't know if you know what a Murphy bed is. You open a door in the living room and you pull the bed down. [Laughter] I thought that was the great invention. >> [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: So a month following you had already mentioned the Pogrom of the Night of Broken Glass and your family was in Cleveland. Do you want it tell us how your family heard the news? >> Frank Liebermann: On the 9th of November we had been to Cleveland for two and a half weeks. My parents decided to ask a neighbor to look in on me. We were in an apartment house in Cleveland. They went to a Wednesday night movie special. I don't know if it was 10 cents or whatever it was. I think it was from 8:00 to 10:00. At about 9:00, the phone rang. I got a person -to-person phone call from my grandparents. I knew it was bad because we're 3:00 in the morning. Since it was person -to-person I didn't talk to anybody but I heard co nversations on the other side. That was the probably worst hour of my life until my parents came home. I knew things were bad. I didn't know what it was. And I had to spill the beans had they came back. That was Kristallnacht. The business was confis cated. Two of my mother's brothers were imprisoned. That was technically the start of the Holocaust. In other words, we escaped it. And I consider myself a witness rather than a survivor because I didn't go through that part but many other people here did. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And what happened to the brother that saw you caught in Bremen? >> Frank Liebermann: They were returned. They came back. He was one of the two who was arrested. He came back. They managed to get papers to go to Hong Kon g -- rather, to Shanghai. There were two places which were issuing visas to refugees at that time; one was Shanghai. By the way, under Japanese occupation. The other one was Haiti, the Dominican Republic, which invited people to come in for their expertise. They were on a boat, on an Italian boat, in the Mediterranean on the day that Italy declared war -- rather, war on Britain and France after Hitler got to Paris with the 6 breakthrough in June 1939. No, June 1940. Excuse me. It led to the -- the ship was returned and they eventually all died in Auschwitz. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: And your family in the United States moved from Cleveland to Dayton, I believe. >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Is that where you grew up f rom age 10 on? >> Frank Liebermann: Correct. It was a wonderful place, especially at that time. It became a boom town. I went to elementary, high school, and college in Cleveland. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I remember reading that your father became very active in the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, now that he was in the United States. I would love for the audience to hear a little bit about your father's work once he came to the United States. >> Frank Liebermann: First of all, when my father came to the United States -- I don't want to go too long but we had an interesting experience. He applied for the Medical Society, which was at that time a license to good standing. Shortly after he applied they called an emergency meeting on a Friday night which is a Jewish Shabbat and passed an ex post facto law requiring citizenship for membership. In other words, in trying to veto his admission. Somebody, we never knew who it was, called the newspapers in outrage. On the following Sunday there was an editorial in the "The Dayton Herald" on freedom of opportunity in the United States. The next day he had 11 new patients a nd became rapidly established. By the way, also after that veto he had a vi sit from the Chief of Staff of Good Samaritan Hospital who said this is an outrage and they offered him staff privileges. We felt very fortunate that we resettled. I had a very, very happy childhood in Dayton. He volunteered every Wednesday and Thursday mornings to do examinations after 1941. In Memorial Hall, the concert hall, was used -- he volunteered for the Army but there was such a shortage of doctors that he was rejected. They wanted people under 40 , which was kind of the peak. Basically that's the end of that story except that we didn't know what was happening during all of World War II because my grandparents were in Theresienstadt until 1944. We never heard from my mother's brothers who were on their way to Hong Kong. I learned afterwards that they ended up in Auschwitz , together with my cousins who had no chance of making it. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I would like to make sure we give our audience a chance to engage with you also, Frank. We will turn to that portion. >> Frank Liebermann: By the way, I'd like to say one other thing. >> Suzanne Brown -F leming: Of course. >> Frank Liebermann: I went back to Germany for the first time when the city of Gliwice, which is now Poland, dedicated a memorial to the contribution of the Jewish community and the growth of the city because Silesia became -- it was a coal mining area , unfortunately brown coal which was highly polluting. But we didn't know that. Nobody knew that at the time. But they dedicated the memorial and I decided at that point to take my family. We all flew into Berlin. First of all, we met in Berlin and spent some time there. I wanted to hate it and I couldn't. We went to the dedication. I introduced my kids to where I came from, which they enjoyed. It was interesting that Poland was interested in writing the history and learning about it. I have since gone back to Germany a couple of times. I've kind of made peace with the country and now look at it as -- the head of the FBI gave a speech here that said that he insists tha t agents come to the Holocaust Museum in order to see what can happen when law enforcement gets out of control. And he said at that point he redefined the word humanity. I always learned that humanity chose the good side but, he said, we have to realize that humanity also has its dark side which we have to control. I, therefore , look at what happened almost generically that in bad times people sometimes look for quick fixes and they can have disastrous consequences. I have to say that I consider myself an American patriot. I've had a chance to live the American dream. And I want my children and grandchildren and yours to have the same opportunities. >> [Applause] 7 >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Before we turn to our audience, I want you to know that it's our tradition in First Person that our first person will have the last word. So after our Q&A I will ask that you remain seated so that you all hear Frank's closing remarks. And after he does give those closing remarks, we're going to ask all of you to stand so that our photographer can take a picture of Frank with you in the background. And also, Frank will remain here on stage so that you can come up and ask him any additional questions and shake his hand or take a photograph with him. We do First Person every Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. I hope you don't miss these opportunities if you're able to take advantage of them. And our recordings are available as well. So now to turn to your questions -- >> Frank Liebermann: By the way. I didn't answer your question. I'd like to add that becau se I'm proud of my family. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: You should be proud of your family. >> Frank Liebermann: My father received a 75th Anniversary Award of International HIAS, which is the resettlement organization, together with President Truman and three others and has been interested in philanthropy and paying back to the opportunities which we've had in the United States. You can consider this as my closing remark. >> [Laughter] >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Those of you who do want to ask Frank a question, we have microphones on each side of the aisle. I'm going to first turn to one Twitter question. It will be on display behind me. What do you hope students get out of their visits to the USHMM? Great question. >> Frank Liebermann: Basically, what I mentioned about the vulnerability of humanity and to be influenced by events -- let's say to learn from our mistakes. We all make mistakes but unless we learn from them and we learn history, we tend to repeat them. There are especially two exhibits here which are scary because of the last 50 years, Cambodia and [Inaudible]. People still haven't learned. That's why students are so important nor museum. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: We invite you to come to the microphone and ask Frank any question on your mind. You know you have questions. [Laughter] Excellent. >> You mentioned having some friends on the playground at school. Have you been able to follow back on those friends to see where they ended up? >> Frank Liebermann: From Europe? >> Yes. >> Frank Liebermann: Unfortunately not. Because of the immediate group, most of them didn't make it. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Thank you. >> Frank Liebermann: I wish I had a more positive answer. >> Were there concentration camps already established in the late `30s and were your parents aware of them? >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. Dachau, outside of Munich, was built almost immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933. They were obviously expanded greatly after the famous conference which established the Final Solution and how to do it. But the German name was prevalent pretty much from the beginning. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: That's right. The first concentration camps were established within months of Adolph Hitler's secession. The first were Jews but also communists, socialists, homosexuals, and so -called a -socials. And the number of concentration camps exploded rapidly. For the Jewish population of Germany, first anti -Jewish laws were also quite immediate. April 1933 were the first anti -Jewish laws which began a series that culminated in the Night of Broken Glass, Pogrom, 8 that Frank mentioned. And all of these things, the laws against Jews and other so -called outsiders and camps were in the newspaper every day and accessible information to everyone. >> With your dad being a doctor, do you know if he was ever involved in the mission where they were doing mercy killings on the handicapped children and the handicapped people? >> Frank Liebermann: I don't think -- that really is a more recent priority. Am I correct? >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Yes. I think, ma'am -- it's a great question. You're talking about the T4 program to murder Germans with medical or -- physical or emotional handicapped -- >> Frank Liebermann: It was part of Nazi agenda. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Yes. >> Frank Liebermann: But it didn't really become an American agenda I would say until when was it, `70s, `80s? >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Your father, for example, as a Jewish physician would have been excluded as a staff member considered worthy of such an important job to the Reich. The euthanasia program, I think, began in the late 1930's. But no Jewish physician would have been allowed to be involved because they wer e victims themselves. >> Did you ever fear that even when you were in America that they would try to come and get you a nd the rest of your family? >> Frank Liebermann: This is why we left school early. In other words, it was more you develop your own instincts. It was safer individually t han as a group. You generally didn't go anywhere in groups f or your own safety. Does that answer your question? >> First of all, Mr. Liebermann, thank you very much for sharing your story. I wanted to know what was the greatest challenge that you faced when trying to make peace with your past and all you went through. >> Frank Liebermann: I'm sorry, the greatest challenge of what? >> What was the greatest challenge that you faced when you were trying to make some pea ce with your past and everything you went through? Was there any moment that you were in a certain building and remembered something? >> Frank Liebermann: I basically feel that hate is a dangerous thing. You have to come to terms with whatever happened and react in a thoughtful way that's going to be constructive. I said I didn't want to go back until there was another occasion but I just felt grudges don't accomplish anything. So I don't think it was that big a challenge. >> Thank you. >> Suzanne Bro wn-Fleming: We've got time for one last question. Someone on the other side of the aisle? >> Hi. I'm from Mexico. I have an uncle who survived the Holocaust. He just passed away like a year ago. He never wanted to say anything about his story or his family. He never wanted to say nothing about the history. He was very affected. So my question is, What would you say to the survivors that are still alive to speak and to say everything? What would you recommend for them to go and speak to the people or to their families? >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: I'm going to repeat the question so it's clear. >> Frank Liebermann: And it's hard to hear. >> Sorry. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: It's ok. For our streaming audience. The young lady here has grandparents , a survivor , from Mexico. And your grandparent, as I understand, was very deeply affected and couldn't talk about it. This young lady would like to know what do you advise on being able to talk about this to other generations? >> Frank Liebermann: My grandchildren and children pushed me to do it because it's part of our heritage. And we want to know about it . It only adds to the respect. We went through quite an issue with -- my mother finally wrote an autobiography. My parents did get interviewed. An issue is always better when it's in the open rather than when it's suppressed. You don't accomplish anything by denial , 9 even though, I have to say, that the Holocaust was denied for one whole generation b oth in Germany and elsewhere. Because it was too horrible to deal with. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: You still get the last word, Frank. I'm still going to ask you to close our program. Remember, after closing it, you need to stand up so that we can take your photo with the audience in the background. And then we'll have all of you come up and meet Frank. Please give us your closing words. >> Frank Liebermann: Unfortunately since I'm a substitute today -- >> Suzanne Bro wn-Fleming: Never a substitute. >> Frank Liebermann: My family wasn't able to get here. [Laughter] I was called two days ago because somebody got sick. So I have to say, first of all, as I said before, I'm happy that I've been able to live the American dream. I have three children who are now approaching senior citizenship age. [Laughter] And five grandchildren. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Shocking, right? >> Frank Liebermann: One of whom, by the way, is studying modern European history. He's working with his Ph.D. Another one is at Harvard Law School. >> Suzanne Brown -Flemi ng: Wow. >> Frank Liebermann: The other ones are just working people. [Laughter] And one, by the way, is a teacher, which is a profession I admire greatly. He teaches high school English in Brooklyn. I'm happy to be where I am. I hope that I was somewhat enlightening in your view of history and how important it is to study it. >> Suzanne Brown -Fleming: Please join me in thanking Frank. >> [Applause]
