Hello. Answer: Hi, how are you? Q: I™m well, how are you? Could you tell me when and where you were born? A: I born in Warsaw, Poland , August the 31st, 1939, exactly one day before the aktion started. Q: Yeah. And can you tell me a little bit about your family? What was your family like? A: Well, I was a second grandchild of to Œ two large families. I mean, large Œ relatively large. There were four Œ four Œ four persons on each side. My father and two sisters and a Œ and a brother. And a widow grandma. And o Œ on my mother™s side, there was my mother, a sister and two brothers, and his mother Œ her mother, as well. There we go. S Œ that™s Œ I had Œ I Œ I Œ a sister who was six and a half years older than me, she born in 1933. An d between us was another girl which Œ who bu Œ who passed away at the age of a year and a half. So I Œ I didn™t learn about her much, okay, that™s Œ and so, was a Œ was a big happiness, you know, first boy in the two families, but don™t ask me what for. Q: Mm-hm. What did your parents do for a living? Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 4A: Pardon me? Q: What did your parents do for a living? A: Well, my mother, she Œ her trade was to make ladies™ hats. And she had her Œ th Œ I think wa Œ the most select clientele in Warsaw, including the Œ the wife of the prime minister and people like this. She was very well known, which was working against her during that period of Nazis, and you know the persecution, so, you know, it™s good on one side, and depends what the times, can be working against. Q: And what did your father do for a living? A: He wa Œ he Œ he Œ he was a Œ a furrier, he cut furs. And he has a small store. That was what he was doing for a living. Q: Mm-hm. And was your family very religious? A: No. Q: No? A: My mother family was very progressive, not religious at all. And on my father™s side they were a little bit more conservative, but no religious. I wouldn™t call them as [indecipherable] religious. Q: Did you celebrate holidays, or Œ A: Oh yes, we Œ I understand. I don™t reme mber that, okay. I mean, they kept the Œ the Œ the Œ the main holidays and, you know, Sabbath and things like that, you Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 5know? They didn't ate s Œ kos her, you know, the strictly [indecipherable]. So that mara Œ more or less has give you the idea. Q: Mm-hm. And what was your sister™s name? A: Sophie. Q: Sophie. A: Sophie. And in the time of wa Œ when Œ wh en Œ you know, the w-war start and oh, the troubled times, Sophie was six and a half. And she Œ she remember, you know, the wealth and all the happiness pre Œ pre-war. So affect her much more than a Œ than affects me, because I was un Œ no conscience about my Œ my own existence Q: Right. A: [indecipherable] I did. On Œ on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little bit more, I don™t know, 19 Œ 1942, when th e first transport of people have been taken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that Œ in that transport went my family; my Œ my Œ my parent Œ my Œ o-on both sides, for the exception of the Œ my Œ my mother™s brother, one of them have been killed. I don™t know if that™s by an accident or what, he be Œ was a fire on the roof in Œ in the ghetto. He went up to the roof, but never came back. He was 25. His name was Ignatius. And the youngest brother my Œ of my mother™s, Henry. He was 18 and he Œ he took poison, he killed himself. But he was in th e underground, the organization, had been Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 6caught, so in order to avoid, you know , further consequences, he did that. I Œ Miriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the Œ to the extermination camp with my Œ with my grandmother, who at th at time was fift Œ 52 years old. And my mother was a widow on the age Œ age of 30. 30? Thir Œ 31 - 32. Q: So, after the war started, what ha Œ what had happened to your family? Did they try to escape Warsaw, or Œ A: No, when my mother Œ my mother Œ my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America, because a cous Œ my ma Œ my Œ my Œ my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa Œ always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir Œ in the late 30s. But my Œ my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa Œ the business was going well, and you know. They thought the war Œ nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was the war start, like everybody else, we Œ we have to move into the ghetto. And the reason why my mom were not ta -taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn™t live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family. And me Œ my Œ my father, the older men of the family, he Œ he was there with Œ with the rest when they close and they ah Œ they emptied the building and took everybody away. So, my mom wa s Œ when she said well Œ she wa Œ she Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 7didn™t Œ she didn™t have any doubts that th is is not for taking her to the working camps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for Œ for death, I am Œ I am running away. If I will be caught on the Œ on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life. So she Œ you kn ow, was corruption, like everywhere else. So she Œ she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray Œ Aryan documents on the other side. They Œ they didn™t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she Œ sh-she Œ es Œ expect to take. So she was very am Œ you know, nervous and watching if the peopl e are coming and bringing the document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the Œ from the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s Œ as Œ close calls like this, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the war, where the Œ the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri Œ also risking a life. But coming back to those times Œ so we Œ we left Œ we left the ghetto, and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to sp end the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south Œ on Œ a Œ a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wisa river. And so sh Œ in order to run from Warsaw, she went there with us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 8noticeable immediately. So, very, very shor t time after, we were on our way back to Warsaw. And of course those Œ those voyages cost money, and we Œ we didn™t have too man Œ too much of it. So shortly after bri Œ getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policem an, also Polish. And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. It™s a big risk. But if you can™t, I have no one to call any more, you know. So Œ and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all the day there until the fire Œ the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself. And he comes convince by her Œ his wife, to help us. And they advise Œ the plan when he Œ what he co mes with was the following. My sister, she was a blonde with blue eyes, that™s no problem. And Œ so she went to a Œ with Œ with Œ were nuns. Q: The con Œ the convent? A: Con-Convent. Q: Mm-hm. A: My mom, he brought her a false docum ent, put her fa Œ photography in that, somebody who was deceased, more or le ss on the same age. The name was Wovataska (ph) Janina (ph). And on these papers she should volunteer to work in Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 9Germany. And this way, according to him, she would survive. And I was the problem, being circumci Œ and he knew a place where he can take me, but the condition was, to take kids there Œ so the kids who have no one, the orphans, abandoned. Q: Mm-hm. Mm, right. A: So Œ because for security reasons, no visits, nobody co ming, nobody know. Q: Right. A: So that Œ that was a condition for this. So he said to my mom, leave Œ the kids have t Œ the kid had to be left in the corn er of the street where I am due, where I am there, it™s Œ it™s my Œ my pl ace to work, no? And my mother couldn™t do that. Well, she had Œ didn™t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di Œ do this for. So Œ Q: And Œ and your sister was how old at this point? A: She was Œ she was at that time, she was nine. So, she had to leave me in the corner and w Œ and, you know, just grab th e first streetcar passing by, that what she did. And I almost get her in, because I started to screaming myself. My sister [indecipherable] . People start to surround me and the policeman comes and he took me, and [indecipherable] the people were, you know, that why [indecipherable] and the place called Klarasebo (ph) in the out-outskirts of Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 10Warsaw, not far from Warsaw, very close to Wilarnow, which is the Œ the Œ the Œ that was the Œ the summer palace of the k Œ the king of Poland in other times. And the convent where I went to, that wa s a Methodist, it™s not Catholic, it was Methodist. So, being Protestants, you know, the German s didn™t bother them, they thou Œ they thought they are part of them Œ Q: Right. A: Œ right? Mas Œ or were more affinity. The woman who look after us, after the kids inside, were all Jewish womens. Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so that™s no Œ nobody would denounce, you kn ow. Were personally interested, right? In that™s time I had two years and two mont hs in that time, when I get separate from my mom. And in Œ in 1946 in Œ in April Œ no, in April of you Œ April, end of April, my mom found us, my sister and me, in a Œ and a ga Œ in a Œ in a Jewish orphanage. That was after the war, in Otwock. And that™s 30 kilometers southeast of Warsaw, on the eastern bank of the Œ of the river. In 1945, when the German s start to retreat, obviously my sister said something which guides the people who are trying to put the families together, because they knew about this organization, and Œ and in no time I have been bring fr Œ brought from that place to Œ to the place where my sister was. But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting the Jew Œ Jewish kids together. So maybe my Œ my sister didn™t say tha Œ nothing, I Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 11don™t know. So, we were taken to Otwock. And well, I survived this way, and I s Œ when my mom comes, I was just re Œ convalescing from, I don™t know, one of those, you know, kids things, measles or something like that. So I Œ I was separate from the rest of the kids, in order to avoid possible, you know Œ Q: Contamination, right. A: Œ epidemics, yeah, right, right. So the lady who was looking after me, her name was Dora , she Œ she ask me to [indecipherable] that™s the Œ this Polish version of my name, yeah. Said, do you know what Œ who is this lady? And I wa Œ I look on her, I remember I [indecipherable] a moment, no, and I said, well, that™s my mom. And my da Œ my mother start to cry. Q: It™s okay, take your time. A: Crazy. Said, what happened to her, what™s wrong with her? I couldn™t understand why she™s crying, you know? Well, I was too small to measure the time and emotions and things like that. And th Œ sinc e then my life changed. So, after that we tried to escape from Poland, and we managed to do that. My mom was a very brave woman, you know. Brave, have guts more than one man Œ man who would like to have it. And so we Œ we escaped from Poland, three Œ four of us. Was my Œ the three of, my mother, my sister, me, plus a young woman, she was 24 at that time, Maryla (ph) Œ I don™t recall her last name now, from Wrocaw. She joined because Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 12she was a daughter of an officer who was a s Œ immediate superior to my father av Œ my Œ my Œ my mother comes back to Poland , she was remarried. Q: Right. A: And she remarried a Polish man who was in the service, in the Œ when the Œ when the troops occupied Germany, defeat Germany, had been occupied by the alliances, so he was part of the Œ of the occupation troop. And he was in the Œ in RAF in England , the Polish squadron, and so the Œ she remarried him. He was a very, very good man, he was a excellent stepfather for me. Stepfather sounds bad, was a good father, I mean. And Œ but he was not Jewish, he was Christian, so I didn™t live Œ grow in the Jewish environmen t with its relations and everything else, I have been deprived from that, all this. Q: Let me Œ A: In 1946, in oc Œ in octo Œ October, he had been transfer to England, and with him, of course, the family. So Œ and also they say, was the kind of person, he says, well, we are Œ if we™re going to be a family, one family, let™s have one surname, so he adopt us both. My daught er Œ my sister and me. And in October of the same year, we were in o Œ already in England, was an entirely different life. And we stay in England until 1949, and my parents decide for Argentina. So we emigrate to Argentina in 1949. So the Œ wha Œ first, second and third grade, I made it in Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 13England, and through grade four I we nt, i-in sp Œ in Spanish in Buenos Aires. Well, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38. Of course, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate, and we had four wonderful daughters. I lost my wife 10 years ago. Q: I™m sorry. A: And I have six grandchildren. And when this congress had a place in Œ in Œ in Toronto , completely by chance, somebody who I knew who was living in the Œ in massa Œ who lives in Massachusetts, called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so and so date, I Œ I™m going to Œ we are going to be in Toronto , herself and her husband. So we will like invite you for a di nner Friday with us. And maybe you™re daughter and your s-son-in-law can join us. So I said, well, I™m answering by myself because I am no Œ I have no comm itment, will be a pleasure, and about them I have to find out, I don™t know. They may be coming to something else Œ Q: Right. A: Œ maybe they can. And that™s Œ really, that what happens, they couldn™t attend, so I went by myself. So we Œ we tal Œ we talk about different things and finally comes a topic, what brought you to Toronto ? And so she mentioned that she is coming to a congress of the hidden children [indecipherable] hidden children of [indecipherable] . What is this? She said, oh, you know, the kids, you know, were Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 14hidden and Œ you know, on the Christian hous es or here and there, and they Œ and the Œ in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to this category. So Œ so I get interested, and that was my fir Œ first attendance, no re Œ with no registration, because I learned the Œ the same day, or very Œ very same day about. Q: Right. A: Next day was starting day, the Œ the congress. So I went there. I met lots of people, different people from different places, and I learn about some Œ I Œ I meet some people who were in Otwock at the same time I were. Of course, now I Œ now I remember the [indecipherable] Q: Right. A: Because I was in the youngest group. But some Œ some of the people I met, they do remember my sister, who wa s seven years older than me. Q: Right. A: And so after that, I re Œ I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew. Okay, I have to tell you my sister passed aw ay very young, on the age of 46, that was in 1979. So, I called my Œ my nephew, and I mention to him that I Œ because I knew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from and whatever, but hi Œ his story [indecipherable] story. But, you know, my sister as well, she didn't have a chance Œ she was never in the Jewish environment. She Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 15married to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the Œ from Pomerania. That™s the northern part of Poland , right on the sea, on the Baltic. A very handsome, nice fellow, so they were Œ were okay, but the Œ the tr Œ all the tradition and everything what could be , have been lost. So, somehow we were lost for the Jewish community, right? But my s Œ nephew always was curious about that, and that was something which, for obvious reas ons, my sister didn™t talk about that. Q: Right. A: Because she was hidden, her br Œ her origin, as my mother did. As long my mother lived, I never mention my origin. I respect her will because listen, I don™t know what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this Œ to decide that. So I were Œ I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like this. Once Œ once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do? If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not? And that was Œ ma Œ ma Œ my Œ my Œ my daughter was like Œ my older da ughter was like 10 years old, and the next one was almost nine. And my mother says, you know, this is something, it™s a big question. I™m not in position to tell you what to do. And after, you know, a Œ a pause, she said, if you want to save them Œ to save them suffering, don™t say it. Q: Wow. Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 16A: That was what she told me. But I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ you know, I kept thinking about it, and finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by ignorance, some of our Œ my kids be in the environment where they will come to be a Œ maybe anti-Semitic or something like this. That™s what™ll be the worst thing what could happen to me right now. So I sa id that, and that was the time when my Œ my wife learned about my [indecipherable]. And I said, well, don™t Œ you don™t have to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian, never mind ho Œ how my person is. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I don™t want to deny it, where I™m coming fro m, and it™s nice to be able to say the truth. So that™s was years ago, and then once ma Œ I had contact with Jews in my trade, because I was in the fur business. And I™d just been exporting fur from Argentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a furrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter. But the people who I knew and I was dealing with al most on the daily basis, most of them were Jews. Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine. People much mature, 30 years older than me. So they Œ they Œ they Œ they lived this period of the Holocaust entirely differently than I did. They were fi Œ 16 - 17, you know, young people, o-or 30 Œ Q: Right. Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 17A: Œ when you Œ when I bor n. So Œ and sh Œ well, make Œ always, you know, exchanging point of view ideas and histor ies and so in Œ and that was something which was eating me up, you know, becaus e on the one side I were so close to them, and I want to be one of them. And that was the Polisher, because I speak very good Polish, and I never learned to speak Yi ddish, unfortunately, so well, that™s life. I lived the way I could. Q: Right. A: And at this stage of my life, since they to Œ the when Œ since, I think was 2001 or 2002, when this pi Œ this Œ this congress and wa Œ in Toronto has place. So when I call my Œ my Œ my nephew, and I told him that I met people from the place I have been in Poland , in the orphanage, and I mention the place, Otwock, say well, you know, I Œ looking through the papers, Mo mmy ple Œ papers, I find the pho Œ a Œ a picture, a photo, and on the Œ on th e reverse says, something written, in Otwock, 1945. Said, can I have this picture or the copy of it? Copy it on both sides. And he did so an-and Œ and send it to me immediatel y. Very diligent, cause I spoke to him Thursday and Monday I had the photo in Toronto . And he lives in San Francisco , so for a freight express, immediately. And, in the photograph it was three young girls, and two little boys, one of them were myself, and Œ and bres to another boy like this, sitting the front, and three girls standing in the back . So also, after the Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 18congress in Toronto , some of the people I met there, they invite me to have a tea in the house, that™s all, to get closer. And one of the ladies, who is 10 years older than me, she is almost 80, she is eight Œ 79. Very nice person. I was in her house, made a mention about this photography and I brought that with me, the copy. And she say, one Œ one second. She went, and she brought the album, and had the same photography made, because the one who was making the photos was her brother, her older brother. He Œ he was a, you know, he was an amateur, he likes to make photos, and he was the one who make this photo. So in Œ so she says, you know, this one, Vanda, I don™t recall the last names. [indecipherable] I don™t Œ I don™t recall Œ is living in Tel Aviv, and this other one, also Vanda, lives in Œ in Jerusalem. She is not passing a very good moment in her life because she is Œ no Œ she is 70, she is overweight, she™s depressed, blah, blah [indecipherable] . Maybe I have to go there and cheer her up, I said, just making a joke, big joke, okay. So, and say, but you know who is liv ing there is this person, Kornblum(ph) his last name [indecipherable] he is very much involved in keeping the Œ the Œ the people who were in this orphanage together, you know, and following who is living where, having the phone number to get in touch, and he also pub Œ publish a boo Œ a little book, memories of the young Œ a young boy™s memories, of his period of time on Œ during the war. And he is a very nice person, you can approach him, and he will be Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 19an excellent guide for you when you go ther e. An-And me Œ so I never had been in Israel before, and that was something which I own on myself. Actually, we were s Œ we were planning to go with my wife, in Œ in the year 2000, but she passed away in 1999 in April. So I didn't go, and after that I didn™t felt like to go, you know. Q: Right. A: So, a Œ a couple years later, I called this person to Œ to Tel Aviv , and so okay, should I speak to you Œ you in English, or in Polish, what i Œ how do you feel more comfortable? So, either way. So we start to speak Polish, and I say, well, I am Œ I Œ I introduce myself. Say, oh, Sophie™s brother. This touch my heart. Somebody Œ excuse me Œ who remember my Œ my late sister so well. That was in January the 12th, and then February the 12 th, I were in Tel Aviv. I met him, his wife. They were classmates, Sophie™s classma Œ classmates, so they knew each other Œ Q: Right. A: Œ very well. My feeling seems Œ the congress in Œ in Toronto was very lucrative [indecipherable] I should call it like that. But a-also was emotional because I Œ I met people who I knew these people exist maybe Œ may exist, but I didn™t know how they are, where they are, right? And then Œ but brought me back to the family. And when I met blum Œ Kornblum (ph), and his wife, we agreed to meet in the morning for breakfast together in the hotel where I were standing. I didn™t know Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 20him and he didn™t know me, but I imagine that must be the person, and he was. Very pleasant. His wife was a little darling. And we stopped to ta lk at nine o™clock on the morning, was 12, lunchtime already, we were sti Œ still talking. So, you know, memories, things, what we do sin ce, and what happened to my sister, you know. We Œ when she Œ he knew that she was living to Œ to Britain , to London , and av Œ nothing else, so Œ anyway, for me was to find, like us finding old family who I left many, many Œ lost many, many years ago. And 1966, in Buenos Aires, on the Œ on the platform, you know, waiting for a subway Œ was a station where combined two different lines. Q: Right. A: So it always is full because you know, people change, it™s a mixture, in Œ interchange place. I saw Œ and Œ and Œ an-and Œ and Œ in a Œ how do you say, in a tremendous amount of people, I saw face, a woman™s face, and I felt Œ touched my heart, you know. Say, I know her, but you know, something very deep. I know her from much, might be from very, very long time ago. I didn™t know, I couldn™t remember, I was trying to remember, because the way impressed me, the fact I saw her. So in Œ in the meantime, I was trying to get closer to her. Q: Right. Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 21A: And I close Œ I came to Œ and I Œ I decide, in this fraction of time, that I must know her from my childhood. Because I have good memory , I play chess, so I Œ I exercise my head Œ memory all the time, you know. Q: Right. A: And I couldn™t remember where I know he r from. So when I get close to her, I approach her in Polish, and she gets scared , and that, so I apologize in Spanish, of course. I didn't meant to Œ to Œ to Œ and, but she respond in Polish, says, who are you? So I say, well, I have my stepsfather surname. Well, what was your original name? So I told her, it didn™t meant nothing to her. So she said, where you were during the war? When I mention where I were during the war, she embraced me. She asked me who Œ who else survive. So Œ and this lady happens to be one of the ladies who look after us in this orphanage where I were, when I was a very little, small boy. Q: Right. A: So the Œ the three pictures of my childhood, which I have and I possess, have been given to me by her, in 1966 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Q: Wow. A: The next Sunday after this encounter, I visit her with my mother. It™s a very, very emotional. She lost all her family, and she marry Œ she remarried to a man who Interview with William Kisielewski November 8, 2008 22also lost all his family. So they met Œ they le Œ and they lived together in Buenos Aires, in a good positions, he was in the Œ in the diamond business and doing well. So they lived in the very, very nice sector of the city. And well, that™s it. Q: I want to ask you Œ A: Sure. Q: I want to Œ I want to go back a little. What Œ what is the first thing you remember, what is the first memory you have of Œ of bein g in a place, or be Œ or seeing a person. Is there something Œ A: No, the first pla Œ the first Œ well, many things Œ well, I™m not going into details, because it™s Œ it™s Œ Q: Mm-hm, right. A: This is a conversation only I had with my mom, and I a Œ a Œ she said to me, you cannot remember that, you were too small. And that is in Sandomierz . Sandomierz is a composed word. San is a [indecipherable] of a river, and domierz is Œ means when it™s reaching to. So it™s a river who reach Œ is reaching another river. Q: Right. A: Getting into Wisa. So that™s the name of the place. Q: Right.
