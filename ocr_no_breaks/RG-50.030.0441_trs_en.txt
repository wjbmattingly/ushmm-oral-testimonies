CARL HIRSCH Question: Could you be so ki nd to tell us your name? Answer: My name is Ca rl Hirsch, pronounced in English Hersh(ph). Q: When were you born? A: I™m born April 1, 1912. Q: And where? A: In a suburb, Mulezootshka(ph), next to this to wn of Czernowitz in the province Bukovina of the Austria-Hungarian empire at that time. Q: Can you tell us in a few wo rds about your school years and yo ur life, your family life during your childhood? A: In August, 1914, when the wa r started and the Russian occupied the Bukovina, my mother fled with many other people from Czernowitz to Vienna, so my first four year s which I remember are from Vienna. We were two children, the father was on the front in Italy. He came once in a while to visit, maybe th ree or four time s during the war. Q: And after the war, what happened to your family? A: In June, in July, 1918, we came back to Czernowi tz and my father who got wounded in the war left, lived for year and half more and then he di ed. And now we stayed wi th our mother and four children at that time, two were born during the war and after the war. Q: Where, where di d you go to school? A: I went to school, primary school in Czernowitz. These were still in German though it was already next to Romania. Then I went to high school in Czernowitz and then in 1929, then I stayed for two years at University of Czernowitz. Starting with mathematics(ph), 1931, I went to Berno(ph), to study engineering but one year later, I came to Bucharest to the polytechnic school. And here where I graduated in co nstruction, civil engineering in 19 35. 1936, I did army service from 1937 through 1940, I stayed in Bucharest and sometimes in the provinces and worked in engineering. 2 Q: When did you, did you return to Czernowitz? A: I returned to Czerno witz at the end of June 1940 when the Russians o ccupied Czernowitz, first in order to be with my family, and secondly because at that time an anti-Semiti c government was installed in Bucharest. Q: Can you go back fo r one moment to the inter-war period and tell us if yo u witnessed any, witnessed any instances of anti-Semitism in Romania? A: Before I came in contact wi th the Romanians, I didn™t know an ything about anti-Semitism. Say around the age of ten or 12, there was a Congress of, Congress of Ro manian students in Czernowitz and they went around town and sang their, their ch ants about long live Romania, death to the Jews. They took off the, there was a municipal theater, they took off the sign __________ which was now only for Romanian place. One year later or two years later, there was after the edu cation was taken over by the Romanian gove rnment and the students didn™t know enough Romanian , most of them failed at the matriculation exam called baccalaureate and some, one protested ve ry heavily. It was shot down by a Romanian student. The student, after a trial was acqu itted. This way, I got to learn about Romanian anti-Semitism. Q: Let™s go back to the summer of 1940 when the Soviets, soldier troops occupied Bukovina. Go ahead, yeah. A: I would like to continue. Q: Yeah, please go ahead. A: Then when I was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, th ere were a number of students were anti-Semitic but the engineering atmosphere prevailed and were , we were treated more or less equally. But at the end of our studies, we didn™t have the same opportunities like the Romanian graduates. The Romanian gradua tes had open fields, we could ta ke only second-hand positions. This was still much better than for other professions. From the prob ably early thirties, no Jew could get a job as a teacher in public schools, only in private sc hools. And no Jew was ever admitted to be a civil service employee. Same thing in the Army. 1936, when I was in the Army, in just an eight months course for e ngineers, the, none of the Jews were , was admitted to the exam to become 3 officer in the Reserve of the Romania Army. So. And we had to serve a few months longer. In my, in 1937, at the end of 1937, when I was employed in a private engineering firm, the __________ the government, the embassy made(ph) the govern ment came to power, K ovan Kuza(ph) and our company gave us every mont hs by the end of the month a note that this is our last month of work and say on January 1, ™38 I got a note that, that my employment will end January 31 st, ™38. February 1 st, I got another note thro ugh January, February 28 th and so forth. Th en Koga Koola(ph) lived, Koga Kooza(ph) fe ll and we continued to work a se cond great, second great engineers, always, always just with smaller, smaller pay an d less rights than the other, the other engineers. Q: Okay. Do you want to add on this subject anything else or we can go to the year 1940? A: Let™s go to the year 1940. Q: Okay, so my question is, what did you witness in terms of Soviet occ upation of Bukovina from July 1940, until June 1941. Wher e during this period of time, during this 11 months, any special policies against the Jews enacted? Were the Jews deported or not? A: During this year, it™ s a full year, not 11 months, it was, it st arted end of June, end of June 1940. War broke out June 22 nd, 1941 and probably early July, the Ru ssians left and th e Romanians came back. During this months, during this year, I wouldn™t say th ere were any anti-Semitic acts taken by the Soviet government. There we re acts rather taken against people who, people who, owners, owners of industrial plants, ow ners of commercial . . . Q: Establishments. A: Establishments. And so forth. Because some or most of that, so me of them, because the Germans and the Romanians had left , so most of these owners who stayed were Jews. And quite a number of them were sent to Sibe ria. Quite a number of them were sent, this was already in June of 1941, a few weeks befo re the war broke out. Q: Did you witness such a deportation? A: I witnessed such a deportat ion because I witnessed first when I came in the morning to the office, I was told what happened. Then I had to go a school for some construction work and the girl came and said, ﬁGoodbye childre n,ﬂ policemen, Russia n policemen next to her. She said, 4 ﬁChildren, these men came to pick me up, my parents are at the railwa y station. I ha ve to go with them.ﬂ And I had a job next to the railway station and I came and saw these people in the trains on their way to Siberia. Q: Okay, let™s move to 22nd of June, 1941. Could describe to us what the beginning of the war meant for you and your family and how was Jewish life in Czernowi tz during the firs t days of the war? A: Okay, so, June 22 nd. We woke up and on the radio we heard Hitler™s voice. Two hundred Russian divisions are on border, we have to defend ourselves and ha ve to go into the, the Soviet Union. There were like probably eight or ten da ys of waiting period and then the Russians left. Quite a number of Jews left with them. I would estimate this as between eight and ten thousand. Q: From a population of? A: Of, of Jewish population of 60 thousand, appr oximately. I was tempted to go as well. Quite a number of my friends went , but we were treated badly by the Ru ssian leaders. Say, the, when we stayed at the office in the last day, they gave aut horizations to, authorizations of evacuations to all the Russians who came from the Soviet Union but wouldn™t give an y to us. So I was afraid, at not myself just with some fr iends, that we would go and they wouldn™t even let us in. We were afraid of the Germans coming here, here as , as occupiers but plus, at that time, I was already in love with Lotte. She said, she said, ﬁI never would leave my family, either.ﬂ And so we stayed and waited for a few more days when the Romanians and with them a few Germans came into Czernowitz. Q: What happened when the Romanians and the Germans entere d Czernowitz? What happened to the Jews? A: Okay. This is just on hearsay. A few we re, a few hundred, maybe a thousand or more were murdered in the first few days. I know about __________ worked, worked with me. And the chief rabbi, Dr. Mark(ph) and then they started taking us to manual labor, cl eaning, then for some construction jobs but say, they came into the houses and took us. Then . . . Q: Who, who came into the ho uses? Romanians or Germans? 5 A: Romanian soldiers. No Germans, I think, were ever involved in any administration of any measures in Czernowitz at that time. Q: Can I ask you another question? A: Yeah. Q: Do you remember wh en and if a yellow star or another type of sign was introduced for the Jews? A: I would say a few weeks, maybe only two weeks later. We were obliged to put on a yellow star. I remember exactly the day, when for the first time we came out into the street with yellow star. Two reactions remain in my memory. One reaction was a Romanian priest who passed us on the street, took off his hat. Anothe r reaction was when the wife of a Romanian janitor who said, ﬁThat™s very good that this happens to you.ﬂ Q: What happened next? A: Okay, next, it was ve ry tough with, because, at this time there was no, not, not enough food. There was many other, there was no electricity, so we had to go and buy food and buy, buy kerosene. And you couldn™t get kerosene and food with the star. So we stayed and we _____ took off the stars and stayed in line and took kerosene. Few days later, a young student, military student, we had at that time I think this was a still high school for military high school, say in, in preparation for officer school. So a student of this school rec ognized me a day or two later that I didn™t have the star and he saw me with the star and took me to work in the, in the field. With other like 40 or 50 Jews. So we worked all day and in front of all of these, he, he picked me __________. Now, this didn™t go on for long. Because so metime, say mid-August, okay, I tr ied to get a permanent work so I wouldn™t be taken to . . . Q: Forced labor. A: Forced labor. And I went to the railway st ation because a fe w years earlier, I was there as a student. We had to go every summer for practice and one of the summers, for two months, I worked in the railway sta tion in what is called the maintenance section wh ich maintained the track and the bridges and the, and the buildings. And the head of this sect ion was the, at my time, he was 6 the assistant head. So he recognized me and he talked this over with the, his chief which was the inspector for that bridges and track and they took me to work. Thou gh at that time I got paid only the pay of a soldier and from then on and through this employment, I, I was not harassed again with forced labor. Q: Okay, can you describe where did you live, how was housing? If you c ould take your time and describe for us the process of ghettoization(ph) in Czernowitz? A: Yeah. Okay. Now at that ti me, yeah, so let, yeah. Two of us , my brother who was a student at the Polytechnic in Bucharest, we, he has not finish ed at that time, and my self, we came back when the, with the Russia occupation. My mother and my two sisters, they had quite a good apartment and we stayed all four of us together under, un der the Soviet Occupation and continued then under the Romanians. Lotte, with her family, stayed diagonally across on the same street so we met there quite often and though as I said, in the beginning, we had probl ems with food, but because in the Bukovina, like in all of Ro mania, food was plenty an d then we got to barter different things from house. We bartered with the peasan ts and we got at that time food enough. Now, this is only say one more month because in October at that time, the ghetto started. Q: So what happened to you and your family? A: At __________ the ghetto? Q: Yeah. A: So on October 11 th, this was on the Sabbath Day, one mo rning, maybe the, the work was from eight to one and from four to seven at that time. Q: What was, what was [talkover] A: I worked for the railway. Q: Oh I see, yeah I see. A: So before eight o™clock, I just ran across the st reet to say hello to Lotte and a neighbor of hers told me, ﬁMr. Engineer, would yo u read this to us?ﬂ The elde rly people, elderly people miss our parents, didn™t still know no Romanian at that time. I read to her, it said, ﬁThere will be punished with death everybody who will house Jews, who will give shelter to people not, not entitled to and 7 those who will help flee people away.ﬂ So I said to her, ﬁI don™t understand. This has no relation to us. We don™t want to flee and we don™t want to give shelter,ﬂ and I read to her. One o™clock I came home for lunch and I saw already people on the street with ba ckpacks. Say what happened? We have to go into a ghetto. So I came home and we packed. My fami ly, they were already packed but we didn™t ever to go. So I went across the street to Lotte and she said, ﬁWe go to a cousin of mine who is in the street, in a street which belongs to the, lives in the street wh ich belongs to the ghetto,ﬂ so we went. And then, there were 11 of us and my mother and her four, four children, Lotte and her sister and their parents and the fian cee of the sister, mother. We all went to this cousin of Lotte™s who lived not far from this place and we slept on th e, the floor for a few days. Six o™clock in the evening, they, a barricade was, was bu ilt and we couldn™t get back, ge t out of the, of the ghetto. Next two days, there was just me t on the street and discussed wh at is going to happen we™s, we were supposed to be __________ into Transnistria, whic h is a province east of Bessarabia, which Germany gave to the Romanians fo r __________. On, on October 14 th, we were told that these three, few streets including ours should pack and go to the railway station. So we put all our belongings on a peasant cart. The peasants came to make some money and we waited on the street to go to the railway station to the trains, bringi ng us Transnistria. In the meantime, while staying there, the people started talking that some number will stay, will not go. And said, one lady said, ﬁYou know, engineers should stay.ﬂ So a Romanian major passed by and I said, ﬁMr. Major, I __________, should I stay or go?ﬂ He said, ﬁStay.ﬂ So I took wi th Lotte this cart which had all the belongings of the 11 of us and we took it out of the streets leading to the railway station into a part of the ghetto we were supposed to leave the next days. We had to bribe a soldier because he was supposed, we were not supposed to go, go there and there we stayed on the floor, all of us, one night only. Next, that evening, Parryom Poppovitch(ph) ca me to the Jewish Hospit al which was the seat of the Jewish community or say the council, Jewish council, __________ we could __________ the community and said, ﬁI have with you, I have for you good news,ﬂ he said. Because he talked to them in Germany, news was called paseera(ph) he said, ﬁPaseera(ph) which is good news. You will stay.ﬂ And the day after, they op ened a few more streets for the ghetto and we got into a very good 8 house belonging to uncle of Lotte™s where we stayed for the next, ‚til the end of the ghetto. But, okay, so I said . . . Q: For how long did yo u stay in that house? A: For almost, okay, so next day this good news from Parryom Po ppovitch(ph) were not that good any more because we were told lists will be arranged by profession s and then they will decide who stays, who goes. So, on this day, I said to Lotte, ﬁEith er we stay or we go, let us get married.ﬂ This was already the Friday af ter the Sabbath Day when the ghetto started. And I saw across the street from this house where __________ said, ﬁRabbi, we would like to get married.ﬂ He said, ﬁToo late.ﬂ It was Friday, two o™clock. Q: So the rabbi said it™s too late. A: Yeah. So next mo rning, we went to the co mmander of the ghetto who was a major of the Romanian army. The army was the supervised, this matter __________ and said, ﬁMr. Major, we would like to get married.ﬂ So he gave us a sold ier, an escort and we went in the morning to the court because it would, the court had to give us a dispensation so we could get married without two weeks waiting. Then we went back in the afternoon, we went to City Hall. City was supposed to, they opened at five o™clock in the evening. _____ _____ five o™clock in the ev ening, so we took this soldier four o™clock and I went fi rst to the railway administration and they told us don™t worry, we have given, we have given the go vernment all the names of our Jewi sh employees, you will stay. Then I went to our other place where my, where my brother worked an d this lady took his name, all the personal data, said, ﬁI will help him.ﬂ Then five o™clock we were married. The, all the employees in this registration office were very gentle. Either by themse lves or the mayor was Parryom Poppovitch(ph) but the re gistrar who was a university professor, he told me, ﬁMr. Engineer,ﬂ before the procedure, ﬁMr. Engineer , I hope to celebrate for you __________Jews many more happy, many more happy occasions also here in Romania.ﬂ And then we went back home, they already, each __________ took out of his backpack whatever , __________ and this was our, our marriage ceremony. And we didn™ t get, go on the honeymoon to Transnistria. Two days later I got two authorizations to stay, on e on the list of the civil engineers, __________ 27 engineers say, 9 took a number and then I got it fr om the, as a railway engineer . And my brother was a mining __________ so he got it too. Two days later, we went home. I think approximately 12 days after we left. Q: Let me, let me ask you if yo u witnessed, witnessed any scene of deportation of other people. A: I was in the rail way station and saw them going to the trains. Q: What did you see? A: I would say that I didn™t see anybody being b eaten. Everything was orde rly. They went with their backpacks to the trains and went on the train. There was no, this was already November 1941. In January ™41, they had these little squalor, or how you call it in, in Bucharest. Q: Uprising. A: Uprising. Here...[End of Si de 1 of Tape 1]...the re was no brutality. Everybody went with his backpack quietly to the trains. I was told later wh en they came back, that they were chased across the __________, with, with brutality. But I didn™t witness, I, I wi tnessed only quiet, their quiet way into the, boarding the trains. Saw it, I saw it from the window of my offices. I would like __________ to end . . . Q: Yah. A: Because I already said this about the gentleness in the office of the registrar in, in the city hall. That during my, the following two and a half years, during my work in this railway office, I encountered only gentleness. Some __________ they have been antiSemites, they were happy that the Jews were not ________ ___. The assistant head of the section kissed me when I came back to work and a German, a German _ _________ who worked with ____________, he treated me with full sympathy and all the others as well. Q: Tell me, please, what happened, how was the life in, in Czernow itz between the fall of 1941 and 1942, during the spring of 1942, summer of 1942 ? What else happened? A: Again, what I will say, yah, in the meantime, many business people, Romanian business people who left Czernowitz when the Ru ssians came in plus other business people from Romania came in and opened the, their previous businesses. Plus, they were given the businesses of the Jews and the 10 business of the Germans. Duri ng the Russian Occupation, the Ge rmans emigrated to Germany. There was, this was an agreement between the Sovi et and the German govern ment. So there was a lot of business to be had in, in Czernowitz and many people from Romania came. If they needed, they needed __________and these we re the __________ so they took them into and they, they may not have paid them very well but they were very ha ppy to have people to car ry on their business. So, somehow, a rule of law was ba ck and you had to wear the star. And we had the curfew at eight o™clock in the evening. But we™re very young and we had friends and we met Sunday for be playing bridge or in order to, not to be on the street at eight o™clock, we slept with our frie nds or they came to sleep with us and we partied and lived there quie tly. With fear, with fear because there was, we knew there is a still long way to go. Q: Let me ask you another questio n. Did you witness the deportati ons from Czernowitz from 1942, from June 1942 and if y ou witnessed something, what exactly you witnessed? A: Okay. In, in June 1942, on three consecutives Sunday mornings in nu mber __________two or three thousand Jews Czernowitz, were taken again in to Transnistria. These were mainly the people who didn™t have government au thorizations, who had had auth orizations only from Parryom Poppovitch(ph). Plus, other people w ho were politically suspect. For instance, a cousin of Lotte™s, a doctor, who had, who was a director of a hospital and other people who were not considered reliable. Leaning, left leanin g, or if an engineer who, lik e me, had come from Romania to Czernowitz to the Russians. But he was, he was with the railways, say 50 kilometers south from, from Czernowitz and he left his employment and came to Czerno witz. And the police found out and they took him so these people were deported in June of ™42. We, in the first night, the bell ring, so I went to the door, open the door and here two soldiers, policemen, __________ policemen asked me, ﬁAre you Kahanni(ph)?ﬂ Says, ﬁNo,ﬂ I say, ﬁKah anni(ph) lives here next door.ﬂ So this lady Kahanni(ph) had a Polish authorization, she knew so mebody was coming and went into hiding.

People went to work and by 1943, mid 1943, the yellow star was taken off. Q: Do you know why? Or you can you, can you [tal kover] comment on this? A: I will comment on this that in the meantime the Romanians found out that the Germans will lose the war and they had to play along and, but they ne eded, they needed some, anybody, that they were not fool on the side of the German s. Basis what, what I suggest.

Come ™42, they said, ﬁYou got, get paid for nine months, three months you are a soldier.ﬂ So they gave us pay for nine months, three months I had to work without money. ™43, we were already assimilated to the Romanian truce and there was only one month without pay. Q: I understand. Can you, ca n you describe for us what th e ration meant for you and when __________? A: Okay. Q: So. A: Now, we all witnessed ____ ______ we were not allowed to listen to radio news but we had neighbors who listened or we went to neighbors who listen so we already knew that the Russians 12 come closer and closer. And in March they were already, say, not far in former Poland, say like hundred or 200 kilometers from German _____ _____. Now by say, afte r mid-March, say maybe this was already 20 th of March, the Romanian le ft and there were a few days of an interim(ph).

When the __________, ﬁGive me your watch.ﬂ Q: Let me, let me ask you anothe r question. Did you witness the return of the Jewish deportees from Transnistria to Chernowitz?(ph) A: What we first witnessed wa s a few Polish Jews who came right after the, the Russian Army, Soviet Army. And here fo r the first time we heard about a real Holocaust . We knew that say, that brutal things happened. But we didn™t have any details about what was happening. Embarrassingly enough, do you know a name, a man by the name of Fred Bernard(ph)? Q: No. A: He has a witness.
