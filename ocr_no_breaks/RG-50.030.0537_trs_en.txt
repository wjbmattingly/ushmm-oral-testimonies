There was a Œ the teacher and the Œ the cantor, he Œ they left for a Œ the U.S., and the Œ so, there was some [indecipherable] teaching there in the Hebrew school, but we were very Œ not too Œ not a great deal, put it this way.

Q: When you were gathering things, because you were forced to leave, your mother and you and Leo , what did you do at the house, what Œ A: We Œ oh, we lived already three families in one, Jews had to start living into one area, on one street. Anyhow, I suppose that was the Œ the plan to Œ to make it easier, I suppose. And we lived in Œ with another Œ with other three families in one large apartment, which I walked in, by the way, in May, when we were in Constance, which was pretty Œ quite traumatic, actually. Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 15Q: This past May? A: This past May, right. Q: How did you feel, standing in the apartment? A: A Œ difficult to describe. It™s Œ it™s Œ it™s still with me.

And we were taken out of the apartment with very small Œ whatever small baggage or luggage, whatever, whatever people took with. And we were assembled at, I think it was the [indecipherable] it was the train station. I don™t recall exactly. Q: Did you know where you were going? A: No idea. Q: Did they tell you [indecipherable] France. A: No, people Œ people did not know where we were going. I remember Leo talking and he Œ talking to someone Œ he was quite bright. He knew which direction we were going, but we didn™t kn ow we were going east or west. So people are going Œ were hoping we™re going west, at least. And Œ Q: You arrived in Camp de Gurs in France. A: In France . Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 16Q: In the internment camp. A: Mm-hm. Q: Describe your experiences when you first arrived. A: We were taken from the train, as I recall. We were taken from the trains onto camion Œ trucks. And the Œ we were pre tty Œ from Œ from the same community, actually, we were together. And the Œ th at was long way. I believe the Germans probably had an Œ had a Œ had Œ they don™t need the consent, but they Œ Vichy , France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there. I don™t remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities. And there were quite a few Œ quite a few children actually there. In Constance there were not too many children, there was just Leo, myself and Hootie(ph) and another child was there actually, or teenager, in this Œ left in the city of Constance . Q: So you Œ it took days to get to Camp de Gurs? A: We Œ I-I don™t remem Œ probably two or three days, something like that, because we stopped, I think. As I learne d later on, there was Œ we didn™t Œ Vichy, France didn™t want to accept us, and they Œ the Germans, you know, tried to Œ I mean Vichy didn™t have much chance there. So in Œ we went to the Œ got to the internment camp of Gurs, and it rained and it was miserable, and we were taken by truck, and then they Œ first, old men out to Œ so Œ so [indecipherable] Simon Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 17[indecipherable] was a cousin to my father, he Hootie™s (ph) Œ Hootie™s(ph) father, and they Œ I remember my mom saying plea se, please take care of my child, this I remember.

Q: How was Œ how were the Œ A: Because food was Œ i-it wasn™t plentiful, but Œ but i-it was there, and there together with Œ my mother and Leo was there together with the other family, the same thing.

Q: So you didn™t feel like there was Œ you didn™t have any chance to even know [indecipherable] A: Flee, or to go, or it was Œ yeah, now in Œ in retrospect think maybe we were probably not far from the Spanish border, but we had Œ didn™t have a chance to get away.

A: The Œ we Œ taken to a home in Œ OSE home, in cru Œ La Creuse (ph), which Œ which there™s about three homes there that they Œ they Œ many of the Œ many of the children or teenagers that were there were from the camp, and some of them were from Œ who were refugees or Kindertransport children from the Œ from Germany that were in the Paris area, and as the Germans came in they Œ they fled f-further. Many of the parents remember remaining in Germany didn™t know what happened to them, and they Œ so Œ Q: How long were you at this home? A: At the Œ hm? Q: In the Œ A: The home?

Did you feel a sense of relief being out of the camp? A: No, I Œ I probably cried for two weeks, being separated from my mother. And we were Œ how should I put it? Kids that came from the camp, they had to be deloused. And the Œ it Œ it Œ the first few weeks were Œ were very hard. But the children there were Œ you know, telling [indecipherable] and some of them Œ we didn™t speak French, most of us didn™t, you know, came from Germany and barely Œ and the Œ we learned really fast. The smaller they were, the faster they learned. Q: And so Œ A: So it was French mostly Œ huh? Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 38Q: Day to day, what was it like? A: In the home? It Œ it was Œ it was good, you know, it was good. Q: And [indecipherable] were Œ A: It was interesting with the Œ with Œ with the other Œ with the other children. There was even a class, there was even a school classroom. And we were, you know, the kids from Œ from Œ yeah, from Œ from that Œ we were integrate in the whole Œ so Œ so to learn French wasn™t Œ I don™t even [indecipherable] I think it took weeks, the kids just Œ just started speaking it and knowing it. Q: Do you remember anyone during that time period, any figure or person that stood out in your mind as being really he lpful to your survival, your day to day survival, your emotional survival? A: Yeah, there was a director of Œ the director of the Œ of the home was Monsieur, Madame Bloch, Bloch , b-l-o-c-h, who Œ who were the really kindest Œ kindest, best people that you Œ who consoled us, I mean , people that came th ere, I think they Œ we understood them, I think they spoke German, and the Œ until we became integrated into the Œ the French society over there. Q: And Œ A: Which didn™t take long, by the way, anyway. Q: You were there for two years, a little Œ Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 39A: Yeah.

A: We were in the Œ they star Œ we were Œ they started looking for places to Œ to hide children, and they Œ so that was in the Œ near the Swiss border, and then i Œ so that was already after deportations from Œ that we knew already that Œ we didn™t know, I mean, that that would be final Œ the final solution there. And hope was always there. But they were hiding children either with fra Œ in France or in Œ in the Œ I was in Chambéry at the Salvation Army, by the way, with another few girls. There was a Œ not a convent, they Œ where th ey were hiding the b oy Œ th-the boys in the religious Œ a Œ like a monastery, probably off in that area. So Œ Q: Hand up for a second to Œ you mentione d deportations. Had you Œ once you left Rivesaltes, how did you know what was going on with your mother? A: We Œ we were in Œ in contact at Œ for Œ for a while. Q: You were receiving letters? Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 40A: Right.

Q: You received the letter, and what did the letter say? A: That they Œ she will be going to a different camp, and she will probably hear from Œ we will hope Œ hopefully hear from her. Something like that, the last Œ the last letter which we had Œ first of all, when we were Œ left Marjolet to go to Haute-Savoie being hidden with a family , with a French family for a wh Œ for a few Œ for a while, we had to Œ we had to get rid of everything [indecipherable] in German everything al-already, uh-huh.
