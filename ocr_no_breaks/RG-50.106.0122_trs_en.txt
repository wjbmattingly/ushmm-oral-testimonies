Answer: I am Irving Schaffer. I was born in Chust, Czechoslovakia . I lived with my three brothers, two sisters and with my parents. In general, we lived a peaceful life with good schools and universities. Q: Were you the oldest in your family? A: No, I have a Œ I have Œ I had an older brother, he™s deceased now. Q: What was his name? A: Michael. Q: And what were the name s of your other siblings? A: Oh, I had a Œ ya Œ Jacob Œ Yankov and He-Herschel, the two sisters, Rachel and Bertha. Q: And where were you born, what year were you born? A: May 26, 1928. Q: Could you tell us about your childhood? Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 4A: My childhood I could really sum up very little. I made a Œ it wa Œ it was all Jewish Œ mostly Jewish education, going to service in the s ynagogue, studying in the evening, in the a Œ in the afternoon, whenever, Sundays. So, I really didn™t have too much fun to Œ to be with other kids who are playing ball or having fun. It was all studying Jewish religion. Q: Did you have any Œ did you live in a small town or in a big town? A: A big city. Q: Mm-hm. Were there lots of Jews there? A: Yes, we Œ we had a lot Œ lots of Jews , we had religious Jews, not Œ conservative and also the non-Conservative, whatever they call them. Q: Reform. A: Reform, that™s right, and we had Yeshivas in our Œ in our Œ Jewish Yeshivas. It was a bi Œ nice, big city that it was Œ it was real nice to be soci alizing with Œ with your own people. I mean, you had everything you wanted. Q: Tell us about your education. A: I went to school, to public school til 1943. In 1943, the Œ I was Œ a-as an individual Jew I was always beaten up by the kids in s Œ in th e school, including the teacher. My history teacher, I remember in 1943, I came a little late to school, he was waiting for me outside the door at the Œ outside the class door and Œ and firmly Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 5pulled me in, in front of the kids, he went ahead and pu-punched me all over my face, in front of the kids. The kids we re laughing, giggling, and I was Œ I was hurting and they were enjoying it. That was number one. Then on the way going home from school, four kids attacked me not far from my home. They Œ I fought back. I was bleeding. They punched me all over my face and kicked me. I fi Œ fought back hard, but I couldn't Œ I was outnumbered. I was bleeding, and not them. Then Œ that Œ that was the end of my sc hools, I couldn™t go any more to school because of that. Q: How was your Jewish Œ how would you describe your Jewish education? When did you go to cheder, or Jewish school? A: I went to cheder and to ser Œ to services til 1943, til things got really worse. In 1943 under the Nazis, things got miserabl e and it got worse all the time. As a Jew you weren™t allowed to go out , only during the day and ce rtain hours, and you had to wear a yellow star and a yellow armband. I remember we went to evening service, evening service with my father once and the two SS, the Hungarian Nazis came in and beat up all the Jews in there and everybody was running in different directions, but most of them escaped and Œ and that was the end of the synagogues, we Œ we couldn™t go no more for services and there wasn™t servi Œ anyway, the end for my father and me. Th-They blocked off all the synagogues, we couldn™t in Œ all Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 6businesses and properties were taken away from Jews. There was just no place that you Œ you Œ you felt safe. Q: Did you know that there was a war going on in Europe at that time? A: Yes, we did, but we didn™t know too much about it because all we knew, we were Œ first of all we had no communica tion with the outside world. Wi Œ there wasn™t telephones like you have here, that you could call up somebody and r-right away you™d tell them Œ any place you move d, you had to have a pass and th-the police were patrolling everywhere, every di Œ so often you would drive down someplace or walk down, you had to have a pass with you. And if you sh Œ you were Œ you were Jewish, right away you had to have a Je wish pass and that you™re circumsi-cised, all that stuff had to be on it, on. So there Œ there wasn™t really too much we could do. Q: When did you notice Œ when did you realize that things were really getting bad? Was it in 1943? A: In 1943. Q: Until then things were nice and pleasant? A: It was Œ it was pre Œ pretty pleasant. We could feel the tension from the SS. We could st Œ of the Nazis, we could feel the tension, but we were still in our own homes, we could still go out and do some shopping. You had to watch yourself Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 7because you were beaten up or taken away the Œ some of the Jews disappeared. But we Œ Q: Did you know where they disappeared to? A: No, no, probably got ‚em Œ ki-killed them. Probably killed them. Q: Mm-hm. When did the Germans come to Chust? A: Oh, I don™t remember exactly, but I Œ I know they were Œ they were there for quite awhile before 1943. And when they came in th-there were Œ it™s Œ things just Œ I can Œ I can remember not only they take away the business and properties, they trained some of the young boys, like mysel f, I was 13 at that time, they trained us just like being in the army. But th Œ we Œ I called this the torture training. What they did, they Œ we marched in step and if somebody ri Œ step Œ didn™t Œ wa-wasn™t going Œ marching the step, there™s one Nazi who I knew my father Œ I Œ I knew very well because he lived across the street, his fath er owned a bar there, he lived across the street from my uncle™s house. And his son was there, he was Œ he was in charge, he was called an SS, you know, Nazi. And Œ Q: Was he German, or Œ A: No, Hungarian. Q: [indecipherable] Hungarian. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 8A: Hungarian, yeah. And he, if somebod y didn™t po Œ go one step, he would go ahead and kick him with his boot, and I™m te Œ the point on his boot, he had a piece of iron welded on, a pointed piece of iron, and when he kicked you, you Œ I remember, he kicked me several times because I wasn™t going in steps and I felt Œ when he kicked me I f Œ th-the pain was so miserable, so painful, I Œ for years I was suffering with it, I remember it. And I coul dn™t do nothing because if I would have tried to hit him back or do something like that, I Œ I Œ probably would have been the end of me. Q: So it was around 1942 that things got really bad, or before that? A: It Œ it started, it started to get bad at that time, but it wasn™t really that bad, that Œ we could still go out shopping and Œ and do the things. We had to be very careful, but it™s just like we live today in this coun try, I™ll tell you, I b Œ you™re afraid to walk the streets. Q: Mm-hm. A: And it™s not that the criminals and crooks are roaming the streets. Q: And the anti-Semitism increased when the Œ A: Yes. Q: And before 1942 you did not experience Œ A: Oh yes. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 9Q: Oh, you did experience? A: Oh yes, we had experience. There was a lot of anti-Semitism. Too many Jew ha Œ Jew haters. That Œ that was part of it that I don™t know, somehow th-the parents taught the children to hate Jews, that the Je ws were Christ killers and the Jews have got everything. The Jews have got Œ are rich, which was not true, not all the Jews were rich. Q: Did you come from a wealthy family? A: No, I did not. Q: So, you did not have any non-Jewish friends? A: I had a Œ a few of them. I had a few who lived in my neighborhood, I Œ we lived in a Œ in a Œ in a neighborhood with Œ which was maybe 40 pe rcent Jewish and 60 percent non-Jewish. But everybody lived in peace, we Œ my mother had a friend across the street, she was a Hungarian woman, she had two sons, and she would come on Saturdays, turn on the stove for us for Shabbat, because Œ and then she did a lot of things that we weren™t allowed to do. She was so nice, we would give her stuff for that, you know, in return. My mother used to be close friends with her, but when the time came, during the Nazi regime, they Œ they were afraid to ta Œ even talk to us. They were afraid to say anything because th Œ if you Œ if we comu Œ communicated with it Œ with Œ with them, with a non-Jew, we probably Œ they Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 10probably would lock them up too, because they were not allowed to do that no more. They were even Œ th-the goyim, the non-Jews we re afraid to communicate. Q: So you came from a religious family. A: Yes. Q: From an Orthodox family. A: Correct. Q: Mm-hm. A: Yes. Q: How old were you when Œ when the war broke? A: The br Œ war broke out? Q: Broke out, yeah. A: My God, I cannot go back. I don™t even know what Œ which year the bro Œ the war broke out because we didn™t feel it that much, we Œ we didn™t know what was going on. Q: So it was really only in what, ™42, that Œ A: ™42 - ™43, something like that. Maybe Œ I think Hitler occupied Czechoslo Œ part of Czechoslovakia in 1941 and I don™t know the Œ when the next time he ch Œ occupied. But we had si Œ before the Nazis took it over, we had Ukraines took it over. There Œ there was two or three differe nt groups, they took it over, we had to Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 11learn different languages. Then the Hungarian took it over and they were Œ they were really in charge because they were Œ they were working together with Œ with the Germans. I remember in Œ my father, who we Œ we got milk from an lo Œ next door neighbor for many years, and when, in 1943 we weren Œ we weren™t allowed to do that, but we did it anyway because we had to go just to the next door neighbor, who broo Œ took off a couple boards from our backyard fence and we went through. But we had, across the street there were two sisters and a brother who lived th Œ a-at Œ at Œ and they Œ they could see us from th e second floor that we were getting milk from our next door neighbor. Th ey reported my father to the police. They picked up my pro Œ the police picked up my father and they took him j Œ to jail. M-My mother was hoping that they™re not going to beat him u-up, you know, they™re just going to take him to jail. But after two weeks he came back, he came back with his black eyes, his whole face was just black. They beat him up all the time and Œ and his beard was chopped up to pieces. So that Œ that was one and it™s Œ it Œ it was so many Œ I mean, it™s hard to believe what was going on. These thing you could see, things are just coming to a point where people were afraid Œ we were, as a Jew was afraid if Œ they were afraid to go out on the street. Everyone taken, just grabbed from the street and taken away someplace, you disappeared or Œ nobody knew where you le Œ where Œ where Œ where you went. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 12Q: When were you required to wear a Jewish star? Was it during that time? A: Yes, during that time. We Œ 1943, we had to wear a yellow star or yellow armband if we went out to the shopping, or Œ or go food shopping or go anyplace, we had to wear that star. Also, in Œ I think I™ve Œ I™ve mentioned about this trainer who trained Jewish boys, that Nazi would train Jewish boys. We Œ we had to Œ not only did he kick us for Œ when we Œ wh-when we went in Œ in steps, but he also wi Œ made us climb a ladder that was about th ree feet low from the to p to get up on the Œ on top of a barn. We had to climb up ther e on top and we Œ in or der to reach it, we had to go pull ourselves up. And order Œ if we came down, we didn™t catch the ladder, we would step on it and we would just go back down on our back and the ladder would fall on our back, on stone s on the bottom and it was hell. Q: Was that in school, that Œ A: No, that was on th Œ on Œ on a field Œ football field that we Œ we had that training. There was no school in there. That was away from everything. Q: How come you were pa rt of that group? A: Because they ti Œ picked up all the th Œ they got orders, all the Jewish boys from a certain age, you™ve got Œ you gotta come to Leventher (ph) they called it. Leventher (ph), Leventher (ph) that Œ I don™t know that™s Hungarian. Q: Uh-huh. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 13A: Yeah. And tha-that™s what they called the Œ they asked all the Œ those Jewish boys should meet at this and this place. So I met them. My brother was already in the la Œ at la Œ in the labor camp at that time. My father was also in the labor camp for six months. Q: Tell us about Œ about your father and brother being sent to labor camp. When did that happen? A: That also happened sometimes at the end of fo Œ 1943. My father was drafted first t-to the ar Œ to the labor army, labor camp, to Œ to labor work. Before that he served two or three years, he fought on the battlefields. He had guns and rifles with him, he Œ he fought like a soldier. Q: For who? A: For Œ for the enemy, whoever the enem y was. I don™t know who they fought. I wasn™t maybe on the Œ Q: On the Œ on the side of whom did you fight? A: I don™t Œ I don™t know. I Œ tho-those days I don™t know. That wasn™t during the Œ during the Nazi occupation, no. But that was before sometimes he may have war Œ fought for Œ with the Russians or Ukrainians, I have got no idea, but I was too young to know about that. But what happene d is, he fought before he would Œ he was Œ he was in the army. He got a rifle and ammunition, he fought like a soldier. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 14Because he was Jewish, they put him to work cutting down Œ they gave him an axe and a saw and he was cutting down trees, chopping them up and so on. Q: When was that? A: That was in 1940 Œ end of 1943. Q: And your brother, too? A: And my brother went also in 1944, th e beginning of 1940 Œ he was drafted and we heard from him only once. My mother sent him some baked cookies and it was returned to Œ they couldn™t find him no more, he was gone. So Œ Q: When was the last time you saw your brother? A: The last time I™ve seen him Œ you mean bef Œ 1944? The Œ before, oh about four or five weeks before Pesach. And Pesach came Œ we Œ we had Œ first day of Pesach was April Œ April 1944. Table was set, everything was there except my brother Michael and all my whole family was together, except my brother Michael. Q: And your father was with you then? A: He was with me, yeah. Q: Was he back from the labor camp? A: Yes. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 15A: He was back from the labor camp, and he Œ oh yeah, that Œ w-we Œ the table was set, we were [indecipherable] the best food was set up on the table. All the family was sitting, my two sisters, three brothers and my parents were all sitting at the table and when my father started to make kiddush, he cried. He said, he would cr Œ he Œ he Œ in the middle of the kiddush he broke down and cr ied. He said these words, he says, who knows whether we will be together again next year. We cried with him, as children, you know, and my Œ my older sist er tried to c-calm us down, but we cried just like after a funeral. It was a very sad Pesach. The next day we were taken from Œ we Œ two SS Œ Hungarian s Œ Nazis came and gave us orders that we have to Œ we must be out of the house by Œ it was in two hours. That™s Œ something like that, or less. They were waiting outside. We packed up everything as soon as we could, you know, and my m Œ we wen Œ went Œ they took us at Œ at gunpoint, they took us to the ghetto. Q: And was the ghetto in Chust? A: Yes, the ghetto was in Chust. They blocked off a few, tw o or three streets. We had a synagogue in there, we were blocked off, and a tomatorah(ph). And they packed in everybody as much as they could without food, water, or toilet facilities. I remember I was inside, there wasn™t even an-any room to sit. They selected a few Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 16th-th-they selected two leaders, two well re putable Jewish leaders in the Œ in th Œ from the Jewish community to run the Œ the ghetto. Q: Do you remember their names? A: Ramel(ph) Moskov(ph), but I don™t remember the other one. Moskov (ph) was one of them. Q: Mm-hm. A: And they were in charge how to run th e ghetto. We Œ they selected some running boys. They selected running b oys for Œ to, you know, take messa Œ like for instance, mine Œ my job was, as a running boy, a few running boys, we got passes that we could go out 24 hours a day. Q: So you were a messenger. A: A messenger, yeah. My Œ my job was, as a messenger, to take messages to the sergeant who was in charge. Anything that came in and it went out, he had to sign it. And every time I would Œ needed somethi ng to sign, I had to run to the Œ to two bars, wa Œ he was in one of the two bars . Sometimes so drunk he di Œ ji Œ didn't even look at a paper, he just signed it. Q: So in other words, the day after Pass over, you had to pack your suitcases and move to the ghetto. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 17A: Whatever we could get, that™s right. Mo-Move at gunpoint, we got to go to ba Œ ghetto, that™s correct. Q: Could you tell us about the conditions in the ghetto? A: Yes. The conditions in the ghetto was, everybody was sitting with a little bundle, whatever they took along, on the floor. Leaning over next to one another, there wasn™t even any sitting room in the rooms. And with no water, no toilet facilities, only i Œ what the synagogue had and there wa s outside one only. Then the rest of it, the food, which was available, we, the messengers got okay fro m the sergeant that we can go to different Jewish homes and pick up all the good e Œ good stuff, like they had stuff in jars, you kn ow, with the Œ for the Œ for the living. So we picked up all that stuff from home, brought it over to the ghetto. That™s only thing that we had to eat. Then also, some of the ink Œ all Œ all Œ people in the Œ in the ghetto, including my father, beca Œ sat down with me and they told me e Œ that I am Œ I can go out 24 hours a day, I™ve got the pass. N-Next Œ around the corner the Œ from the building, from the synagogue, there is a Œ a Œ there was a Jewish store by the go Œ non-Jew took it over. And it™s a grocery store and he gets some breads every day, I don™t know how many, 15 - 20 loaf, whatever. If Œ they asked me I should ask him if they co Œ would sell some bread f-for us and we™ll pay the price, there™s no problem for money. I talked to the Œ to owner, he okay ed it. I used to get from him six, eight Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 18loaves of breads and I would put them un der my jacket on both sides and wait for the Œ for the guards to turn their faces away. And some of us knew already Œ somebody knew that I™m gonna come there w ith the breads to the window and they saw me coming, they opened up the window fast, and I just threw it in one, two, three and I took off. We have been done Œ we have done that every single day. We had to Œ we had to gamble with our liv es because that was part of survival. Whatever we could get in, the little babies and children could at least eat. And then I also Œ Q: Did people work while they were living in the ghetto? A: No, no. No work. You weren't allowed to go no place, only inside, whatever, there was nothing to do, you were Œ there was [indecipherable] Q: How many people did th ey put in that ghetto?

So after we got Œ after we got the uniforms on, we were marched towards one of the barrack s, not knowing where we were going. There was bunker, triple bunkers that we could Œ you could Œ you Œ you were there with Œ without a pillow, without a pillow and you were just i-in a sitting, half a Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 29dozen guys in one little corner and sticking out your head. While I was waiting there, someone told me from Œ who was from my city that my older sister was waving, she wants to say hello to me. I di dn™t even know that she was up there. So I went Œ I went outside, and [indecipherable] going out and the prisoners are hollering at me, says don™t go to Œ with the [indecipherable] you Œ they are going to kill you, don™t go, don™t go. They kept on begging me don™t go. I just kept on going without thinking. I just kept on going. I came to the door and I open up the door, nobody™s out there and I see a Œ a young girl. There was a 10 foot tall electrified wire. And one of the girls, a young girl maybe about 12 - 14 years old was sitting in there, it was so Œ probably electrocuted Œ she was electrocuted, she was all t-tangled up like Œ like a Œ a snake. And I waved Œ I saw my sister in the big window, she was up on a hill. And I waved to her, she was off her Œ cut her hair off, she had nothing on, it was Œ looked terribl e. I waved to her and she waved to me and all of a sudden I got hit with a lead pipe on the right side of my head. My skull was cracked in here. I got ou Œ I was bleeding like a to Œ you turn on a water faucet. And I da Œ da Œ I was Œ I staggered to th Œ my bunk, I turned around, I staggered to my bunk. And while I Œ I was going, I pushed in my end of my uniform from my Œ from my Œ that blue striped uniform, I pushe d it in to stop the bleeding. I finally got to my bunk bed and I got in there. And I was lucky, the next day those people who Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 30were like me, they Œ they knocked off and they put them in the gas chamber. They just didn™t Œ whatever they could get, they would kill people, no matter what Œ a lead pipe th-th Œ killed one, two, three people. So I came into the Œ I went to the barrack at Œ luckily, next day, or a co uple days later, I was shipped to the Warsaw th Œ ghetto. The Warsaw bomb ghetto. Q: So how long were you in Auschwitz? A: In Auschwitz? A few days, a few days. Q: Just a few days? A: Just a few days. We didn™t have no food, nothing, we were just waiting, not knowing what we™re Œ where we were going. We were all isolated in the barrack, we didn™t know where we were going. Q: So that was around April Œ A: Sometimes April or May, I Œ I Œ Q: Œ April, May 1944. A: Yes. Q: So after a few days they sent you to Warsaw ? A: That™s correct, yes. Q: Did they tell you where you were going? A: No, no. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 31Q: Could you tell us about that? A: Yes, I™ll be glad to. We arrived to Auschwitz Œ I mean to, excuse me, we arrived to Warsaw and they had built cement block Œ cement blocks bara Œ barracks. The barracks had bunkers and we Œ we had one blanket to Œ for each prisoner. We used to pray whenever we could, in the evening especially after work, we would [indecipherable] . And we Œ while we were praying, we had one or two of the boys, Jewish boys, watching in case the kapo , which was a killer, would Œ if Œ he hated Œ he would kill the prisoners or do harm to him no matter whether he Œ they did something or not Œ we did something wro ng or not. One day we were standing the Amidah and all of us jumped in a bed, we kept on orlay(ph), orlay(ph) , we™d Œ we™d t-tell him to r-run. This older man in there, maybe about 55, he was standing o-on the Œ on the Œ he was st Œ he wa s standing on the wall, and he was shockling(ph) Œ you know, he was Œ he was standing the Amidah. We told him to Œ to move, he wouldn™t move, because the Torah says you™re not allowed to move your feet when you stand the Amidah . So the kapo comes and puts in his brass knuckles and gets ahold on the man in the back while he was still standing the Amidah and turns him around and punches hi m in the face with the nu Œ brass knuckles. He threw him against the cement block and as he bounced Œ the head bounced back, he was punc Œ re-punching him again. Constantly his eyes were Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 32black, his face was chopped up like a hamburger, you couldn™t recognize the face. He just kept on beating him, he had big [indecipherable] he just kept on pounding him. He had a Œ his fa Œ that Œ that man had a 16 years ol d son, his son was watching how his father got killed like that. And there was nothing we could do, because the minute you made a move, you w Œ all of us were gone. They had Œ Jewish life would Œ didn™t mean anything. Q: Were there any people from Chust in Warsaw ? A: Yes, yes, oh yes. There were Œ there were quite a few of them in there. I don™t know how many survived. I knew one of them who lives Œ a Solomon(ph) who lives in New York, but he was an older man, maybe he™s Œ he™s in the ground by now. That™s why I™m trying to tell my test imony about my experience in ge Œ in the Holocaust, because the time is running out for me too. I don™t know how long I™m gonna be here and the world must know what wi Œ how six million died and how much suffering they Œ they endured. Well, while we worked Œ while we were i-in the Warsaw bomb ghetto, we Œ we Œ Q: Did you know about the Warsaw uprising, or not? A: No. No, we didn™t know nothing. Q: But when you got there, did you find Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 33A: We found out, that™s correct, we fou nd out what we are doing there because it™s Œ that si Œ the big sign said Warsaw whatever, I forgot the name, but it was a big sign, big sign, it said Warsaw ghetto, or whatever. Then we worked in there to clean up the ghetto and whatever usable items w-we found, we shipped it to Germany to be reused. We cleaned up the bricks from the bombed a-area and they sh-shipped it to Germany to u Œ to use it for s Œ b-building other ammunition factories, whatever. Q: Mm-hm. A: While we worked there we found pots and pans. We found dead Œ skeletons, older people and they™re with th eir beards still on. With the sheitel, some of the women with the sheitels were hanging next Œ were right next to them and they™re just like you Œ they just took it off. We Œ once we found six skeletons, young children huddled together. We Œ there Œ it was so unbelievable that they were Œ it could have been a family, although some of these children tried to survive, they held together for their Œ during the bombing or they just starved like that. They Œ they Œ I remember we used to take off their shinbones and Œ and we used to guess how old these children were. I™ve got now a grandson, and you know, ke-keep on looking at his shinbone here Œ about a year and a half old Œ and I keep on looking at the shinbones and I said, my God, th-that-that Œ that™s pretty close what I™ve seen Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 34when we Œ th-there must have been some Œ sometimes about a year or so, all those kids. And we used to Œ one day at work Œ Q: What sort of work did you do apart from just cleaning the Œ A: Cleaning the bricks and Œ and moving dirt. Dump Œ pour Œ throwing it from one prisoner to another, to a Œ to a cart that th e ge Œ Polish people came in and took it to the railroad. And we would throw it down from the top of Œ of a hill, like from the bombed parts, maybe make a Œ a chain and we throw it one Œ for one another, til it go-got to the cart, to Œ with the horse and buggy, yeah. Q: Were you organized? Was there some kind of organization from the Jewish prisoners? A: N-No, no. Q: Nobody was a leader, or Œ A: You™re not Œ you wouldn™t allowed to have Œ be a leader, because the minute they heard you were a leader, you were dead. We did it between ourselves. We talked our language, sometimes Hebrew , the different words so they don™t understand, like orlay(ph). We Œ the Œ somebody Œ the kapo would come or Œ or some SS, we Œ it™s orlay(ph) orlay (ph) orlay(ph), that means keep on moving, moving, you know, or Œ or some other words we used to use, I forgot already. But we Œ on the way Œ one day Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 35Q: Can you describe a typical day in the ghetto? A: In the ghetto? Q: A typical day, yeah, what tim e did you get up in the morning? A: Oh yeah, w-we got up in the m Œ in th e morning we used to get up around 4:30. We have black coffee and a piece of bread , cornbread and we marched through the Œ most of the time we marche d through the forest so nobody could see us. And we came Œ we came Œ it took us about a half an hour to get to march there, to Œ to the bomb ghetto. Once we were there, everybody was at sh Œ working in different ththings. There were so many things going on that Œ End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B Q: Œ that you would get up at four in th e morning and he came into the workplace. A: That™s right, yeah. And once on the way going to work, we wo Œ sometimes, once or twice a week, we would see German trucks loaded with partisans. How we knew they were partisans, while we were marching si Œ the back cover opened up from the wind, it would just open up, I coul d see them. They were blindfolded with black rags, their eyes and tied up in the ba ck. I remember seeing some of the faces, you know, turning; they heard the marc hing, you know, the noises from marching. They turned towards us, and I said to myself, God, I wish, oh, I wish I could help Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 36you. I don™t know Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I felt so ba d. I wish I could have gone over and just blown out the whole thing with them so th-they wouldn™t take them. And then they would take them to Œ to the Œ to a place which was right in our Œ on the ou-outside of the Œ from our camp where we Œ where w Œ and Œ and there was a slaughterhouse. They put up a cement bl ock outsi Œ you know, it™s Œ was outside, but a Œ a wall, four walls. And they woul d take in those prisoners, I mean, the partisans, shoot them out. In the evening you™d hear the machine guns going for 10 - 15 minutes. They Œ they wou Œ in fact, when we used to Œ sometimes when it rained and the ground was wet, and we wa lked in their direction, my wooden shoes had a line, like red Œ red ink Œ red Œ red Œ red paint, but it was blood. The blood was Œ was soaked over the ground in there, they used to kill so many of them. Q: And you were taken at four in the morning to work and then Œ A: We quit around f Œ when Œ later in the evening, about eight, 10 hours sometimes. It depends Œ I forgot already, but I know usually eight, 10 hours a day we [indecipherable] . When it start to get dark, we w Œ took off, all the time. Q: Were you given some food at lunchtime? A: No. No food. Q: Only breakfast? Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 37A: No, only bre Œ wa Œ only thing you took along with you, if you had a piece of bread Œ I remember I used to take along a piece of bread in my pocket, sew it in because there was no pockets and save it. When I was ready to Œ to faint from hunger, I would take a little crumb and put it on my tongue and just keep on sucking on it to keep me alive. And you know, one day, there was one a Œ one interesting i-i-incident. I Œ I was walking, you know, I was like in an Œ in an area where I Œ I was digging up bricks to be cleaned up. And a ll of a sudden I got hit on my ankle with a piece of brick. And I turned around Œ that hurted Œ I turned around and I look around, I didn™t see nobody. I said oh, forg et it, maybe somebody just in a joke did something. Then suddenly I see little pebbles flying around me and I got hit again in my foot, a little higher. I turned around, I said to myself, oh boy, that Œ I got to find out who that is. I turned around and I see somebody sticking Œ somebody was sticking out the Œ the head from under the rubble, just enough to see his head. He had black hair on and he was pointing with his finger to Œ to follow him, to ca Œ to go Œ to escape. Now, I made two steps a nd I suddenly jumped back, I said to myself, oh my God, I remember I got beaten up by a Œ the lead pipe. I cannot take that pain no more. I™m still hurting from it, I™m still in pain. And I didn Œ wouldn™t go, but he was trying to ma Œ make me escape. A lot of the prisoners escaped. Q: Uh-huh. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 38A: But tha Œ tha Œ they escape and probably they caught them, because they kept on killing them all the time. Yes, so then, from there I had the Œ the Russians started t-to Œ we Œ di Œ oh yeah, you used to get so many of the partisans, so many captured of the partisans that they decided to build a crematorium, a small one. First we thought it™s going to be a bakery. We were waiting and waiting, we were asking Œ I know the people who bou Œ built it were Katz(ph), they lived in my city. A young son and a fath Œ it™s a father and son. We™re waiting for it to be finished, and here Œ everybody™s talking a bakery, a bakery, what else could it be? He finally was finished and it was a Œ before we were supposed to be liquidating the camp, and wwe found out it was a small crematorium. It looked like a Œ a bakery. They killed the father and son first, they bur-burned th em, they were the first ones to burn. We, at two Œ two days later the commanding offi cer told us that we™re going to go Œ we™re going to liquidate the camp, and Œ Q: Do you remember the name of the commander of that camp? A: No, no, I cannot remember. My head were blank after that, I got hit with a lead pipe and I had Œ from hunger and thirst we were just Œ you couldn™t think straight. Okay, where was I? Q: Yeah, before you had to liquidate the camp. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 39A: Oh yeah, before we Œ before we Œ yeah, he Œ the Œ th-the commanding officer told us that we™re going to liquidate the camp next da y. The next day came, they asked all those prisoners w ho cannot walk will go by tr uck, about a hundred of them, moved out, they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse, and we Œ while we were standing in role call, they were Œ we could hear the machine guns going that killed them all. They hung six prisoners on wooden poles, and they™d sa Œ th-the commanding officer said, the reason why they™re Œ that we hung them is because they de Œ tried to escape yesterday. We found out this Œ this is go Œ going to be a Œ called Warsaw death march. Q: What Œ when was the Œ I mean, how long Œ A: In aug Œ Q: Œ were you in the Œ in the Œ in Warsaw? A: I-In August i Œ we started out in August sometimes, that i Œ one thing I Œ I will Œ somehow somebody told us that, one of the SS, what month it is in. August Œ sometimes beginning of August.

A: Oh, there was Œ must have been Œ when we got there from Auschwitz, we were about 1100. I don™t know how Œ after all the killings and so on, maybe about seven, eight hundred, we march Œ Q: That started marching towards [indecipherable] A: Yeah, marching, yeah, right.

A: Yeah, the Russians were Œ started to move in, they were Œ they were shelling the area and they Œ they were gonna Œ they™re getting closer and they were Œ liquidated the camp. So we Œ we were marching day an d night without food or water and some of the prisoners co Œ collapsed. They would pick them up, put them in carts and put them in Œ then on trucks and ship them to Dachau. Or we buried them off the road. I remember where I buried three bodies, three corpse, off the road near a bridge. We Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 41put them on top one another, we dug deep enough to Œ just to put in the bodies on top one another. One was still alive on top on Œ he was begging us, please [speaks foreign language here] he says [speaks foreign language]. I™m still living. Why are you trying to kill me? Why are you two bu r Œ why are you burying me alive? He was stretching out a hand to us, and the SS kept on hollering. He says, cover him up, cover him up. We covered him up, we had to take off. We marched again. They had Œ their fa Œ con Œ I mean, the Œ the Œ th -the-the prisoners are just falling like Œ it™s unbelievable, they™re just collapsin g from Œ from hunger and thirst and dehydration. You can survive a lot longer from not eating food, but if you don™t have any water Œ try to go for water in th e sun all day long, marching, without the hat, nothing, just in your uniform. We came to a place near Œ near a bridge in the Œ some of the prisoners tried to escape. They jumped over the bridge, tried to escape or to get Œ to get some water. They send in the German Shepherds after them, and they Œ after the germ Œ th-the shepherds found them, they went ahead and used the machine gun, boom, boom, boom, they killed them in there. Then we Œ we used to get Œ one day it was raining hard and we were told to go into a forest. We went into that forest and we slept on the ground without coverage, we didn™t have nothing, just our uniform. But, I mean it™s th-the Œ typhus develo ped and they were dying all over. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 42Q: How many days did yo u march, do you know? A: Gosh, I don™t remember. I don™t know, maybe four or five days, I don™t remember. I™ve got no idea, just kept on Œ it was just Œ I was in another world, I didn't even know. When we st opped at that place, we were Œ some of the prisoners were digging with their spoons. We very seldom had spoons, we ate by the Œ our hands. I don™t know where th ey got the spoons, but they were digging the ground, where there™s Œ th-the ground, there wasn™t too far away from a lake. And we heard sometimes after midnight a huge roar, water, water, everybody™s running towards water, water, water. I came over to that place too, with the other prisoners and I see everybody™s grabbing handsful, it Œ from the ground it™s coming up water about Œ oh, about two, three feet, it™s jumping up, pop-popping up. I remember everybody was grabbing [indecipherable] the bottom had Œ Q: They were digging with their spoons to find water? A: To find water, yes, and they found it, came up enough. The-They Œ and suddenly everybody knew about it, the prisoners knew about it and they ran for water. Wi Œ I remember grabbing hands full of water with sand and stones and just shoving it into my throat, swallowing, choking myself on the stones. I couldn™t even Œ you know, it™s hard to believe that Œ that Œ we Œ we were crazy, we didn™t know, we were out of our minds. We didn™t know from life or death, we didn™t know what Œ who we Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 43are or where Œ what we are. We were just oh, completely out. We were Œ we were Œ something that it™s hard to believe that a human being can Œ can survive something like that. Q: And you finally arrived in Dachau ? A: No, next day we took Œ marched again. Q: Mm-hm. A: We finally arrived to a place where we were waiting for a train. It was called Kutno. Kutno at the Œ at the German Polish border. German Œ Kutno at the German Polish border, yeah. And we were waiting there for a train to arrive to take us someplace. It was pouring, it was rain ing hard. First when we got there, we stripped all the bark from the trees. Anythi ng that was available, branches, we just ate. Grass, whatever we can get ahold on, anything. We were starved, we didn™t have nothing to Œ Q: How many days did you march to Œ to get to Kutno ? A: Oh, I have got no idea. Four or five days, I can™t Œ don™t remember. Q: And all that time without food? A: Without food, without water, skeletons were walking. Q: Oh my Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 44A: Skeletons were walking. There was nothing Œ black lips, with Œ with dying there™s no breathe Œ you can™t hardly breathe, you™re so weak. And we Œ we waited in that forest, it was pouri ng and we were Œ were in th e mud. We were trying to huddle together so we can get our body temperature warm from one another. That™s only heat we had and the prisoners were starting to die from typhus and all the temperature, they had high temperatures from being sick, and they were dying like f Œ by the dozens. We could not bury them fa st enough. Finally, two days later a train arrived, a freight train arrived. They packed in in the boxcars a hundred or more people in one boxcar. I remember we were standing like this, in the upright position like sn Œ stacked herring. There was no air, no water, no food. Q: No sanitation. A: No sanitation. They boarded up the little windows from outside, what the freight gets. There was Œ it was choking inside. We were tearing our heads apart, we were trying to kill ourselves, but we couldn™t. We were tearing our eyes out, we were ki Œ pounding on our heads. We ti Œ we couldn ™t Œ we wanted to die, but there was no way then there, we couldn™t even take a little step to get a Œ to do something, to Œ to kill ourselves. They just kept on falling and dying, from the weakness some of them collapsed, then the al Œ the smell was awful. And we started to get more room once some of them passed out or just Œ just couldn™t do any more, couldn™t get it Œ go on Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 45any more. We finally arrived to Dachau death camp. I remember seven of us were moved out Œ were Œ were Œ came out from th at freight car. The rest of them were half dead or dead, from the 110. We gets Œ as we came down, there was six feet of a drop. The SS kept on sh Œ pulling us, you know, gra Œ grabbing us with the rifle butts, hitting us and he Œ come on, come on [indecipherable] you, and I remember they grabbed me from Œ they grabbed me fr Œ with one hand, and I fell on my left shoulder upside down, because the six foot drop. And I couldn™t move, I kept on crawling, they kept on pounding on my back with the rifle butts. And just [speaks foreign language] . And th Œ I kept on running. I kept on getting up and kept on going up. I didn™t want to die ab Œ I always remember what my father told me at the Auschwitz, be strong, don™t give up, we will meet again. I just kept on going. We finally came into the Œ inside the Dachau entrance on the Œ it was cement floor. I remember seeing dozens of skeletons, their eyes in, you know, you could hardly see like eyeballs where goo Œ they were just sunk in. And these skeletons, all in black lips, all they were moaning and moaning and moan Œ I remember I ca Œ I fell o Œ I collapsed on my knees and I passed out, and there I fell asleep. When I woke up I suddenly remembered, oh I mi Œ I got to meet my father again, I better be Œ I got to be stronger, I got to keep on going. I got up and moved around a little bit, here and there, and I don™t know, I Œ all of a sudden, I dr Œ don™t remember any more to Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 46what happened in Dachau , I wounded up in Landsberg lager s Œ lager seven, camp seven. And that is where I was put on on a night shift to work at Mühldorf , that night shift to Œ to build the ammunition factory. We™d [indecipherable] we Œ we set a foundation, the foundation there. We used to work 10 Œ 10 hou rs a day. It was hard work. I remember one day one of the prisoners collapsed on the ramp with his sack of cement. The SS ran over Œ two SS ran over and pounded on his head with his rifle butt. And then they Œ they asked for Œ for the prisoners to help him put on this sandbag. I went ose Œ I was one of th em, too, I went over and helped to put it up, and he couldn™t get up, he couldn™t get up. They went ahead and asked some of the prisoners to take him ups tairs and put him in the ceme nt mixer. They put in his head in the cement mixer, and then they took him out, took him back to the Œ to the camp, to Dachau. But they just Œ just told him to put him in in there to grind him around a little bit. Then wa Œ there was a German Œ there was a German who used Œ what do you call these big machines? The cranes. He was digging ground in there, and he used to bake potatoes in side that Œ they Œ they used to have coal in there, he used to bake potatoes. He would always have a full load ed oven with potatoes. And we Œ if we get a chance, we ran over to him, he would give us four or five potatoes. It was like a steak, it was great. Hot, it was just burning, it was just beautiful. He told me once, he says, if they catch me, I hope the SS don™t report me to Œ to the Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 47the higher authority, otherwise I™m no Œ I™m going to be punished. But the Œ a lot of the SS knew about it, they saw us doing it, y ou know, they saw what we™re doing. There was a Œ on the also, ag Œ not far away was a Œ was a garden of vegetables and so on. I remember we ran over there, break through the wire and we stole that. We kept on eating it while we were there. The minute we brought it in to Œ to the other prisoners, it was gone. In a minute, it was Œ it was gone, they tore at you, they kill you for a piece of bread. So then, from there I was very weak and I said to myself, I got to ta Œ I™m Œ I™m never going to surv ive. I™ve got no energy and I cannot carry that cement. And I see where also some of the weak guy Œ people, they bring them in from work, put them in a death barrack. Still alive. No doctors, no nothing, no medicines. You Œ you cannot work, or your Œ something happens to you, there™s the death barrack, that™s your medici ne, death. Death. I decided Œ Q: They didn™t kill them there, they just let them die? A: Let them die. Let them die. Q: Mm-hm. A: That™s exactly what happened. So one day I cam e home from Œ from work and one of my friends told me th at a friend of mine I used to work with together, you know, we Œ some of the times we used to Œ he is Œ th-they put him in the death barrack. I was anxious to find out who he is . They took me there to him and he Œ I Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 48saw, oh maybe about 40 or 50 bodies. He was hanging with his head down and actually li Œ looking at us that he is still alive. He was Œ he was upside-down like this. We couldn™t go too close because it wa s typhus in there. Everywhere you went in was a dangers you would pick up someth ing. But I went away brokenhearted and I said to myself, I Œ that could be me next . I was Œ I was ready to cry and then I said to myself, oh no I better don™t cry, I may be here tomorrow. I decided that I™m going to steal some potatoes. It wasn™t t oo far away from a bunker, because I ca Œ I didn™t want to die, I wanted to live. One morning I went to the bunker. I tied up my pajamas, my Œ my Œ my uniform on the bottom and I went in the bunker, I filled up my pants full of potatoes. Some other p-prisoners encouraged me to do it too because they were going to give me a piece of bread and they were going to buy some butter for that. So I Œ Q: Oh, you were bartering the Œ bartering the food that you got? You would exchange the potatoes for some [indecipherable] A: Potatoes for something else, yeah, like a piece of bread, or Œ or piece of bread or butter, whatever it is. Sometimes they will bring in some smuggling, something from outside, a candy or whatever. A cigare tte. And I filled it up and all of a sudden I hear hoo, hoo, the sirens are going. I sa id, oh my God, this is the second siren already, I didn™t hear the first one. I must have been busy du Œ doing business in Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 49there big Œ I was a big businessman trying to figure out how much Œ how much I™m going to sell th-the potatoes for bread. And su-suddenly I Œ I started to run towards my barrack. I said, oh my God, this is the second one. Here, I wouldn™t give up the potatoes, I™m Œ this is my life. I wouldn™t gi ve it up in ci Œ to let go the potatoes, I k Œ I k Œ held them in my Œ in my pants. I ran towards my barrack and I hear the lager Œ th-the commander is asking to go ba ck in the barracks all the Œ all the Lagerfuhrers, all the Œ should go back in th e Œ in the barracks and find the prisoner, dead or alive. I knew they were talking about me, so I kept on running towards my barrack. While they went inside, I kept on running to my Œ towards my barrack. I came to my barrack all out of breath, and we Œ my feet are just co Œ loaded, you know, I cannot even run, but I™m Œ I™m robbing the potatoes, so I™m looking like this, loaded. And I se Œ run into the second row and I™m standing, you know, attention. Everybody came out, the commander officer a-asked, count the men again, in your barrack. They counte d, everybody was there. The commanding officer says, who just came in? Was quiet. He started with again Œ who just came in? The prisoner next to me pointed a finge r at me. Well, they Œ they saw my pants loaded, they got ahold of me , took me in into a small [indecipherable] they asked Œ the officer asked one of the kapos in there, Killer, who used to be good doing the punishment, torturing. They got ahold of me , took me into a small locker room, on a Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 50heavy piece of wood, put me on there, tied up my hands in a bracket o-over my head, and my knees to a bracket. [indecipherable] I remember he kept on pounding on me with some kind of a heavy piece of wood, or a two by four. I remember screaming. I remember screaming, and that™s about all. I don™t remember any more. I woke up Œ I woke up in a Œ in a doghouse. I was Œ I woke up in a doghouse. I was crammed in with two other prisoners, one was dead and one was moaning. I don™t know how many days I was in there, beca use I was out, passed out. And one of the officers was Œ was inspecting Œ one of the officers was inspecting th-th-the Œ the camp and he came Œ when he went by there, he heard the moaning, he asked, who is in there, to open up. He saw us in there, gave him one look with my eyes can hardly open up, he says, let the ma Œ let the pr isoners loose. I don™t know, first time, you know, so that they carried me in. I don™t know wi Œ the other prisoners, what they did with them, but they carried me into my barrack. I couldn™t walk because my back was all messed up. And the reason why they did that, because the officer gave the orders. Otherwise so they would put me in the ba Œ in the death barrack. They took me into the barrack and they told me I™ve got two days to recuperate and I have to go to work. In the meantime I asked for Œ from the Lagerfuhrers Œ I mean, the camp l-leader for some food. He said, I™ll give you so me food. Did you get your Œ your piece of bread every day, and you know, at night time soup? I said, no, I Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 51didn™t get nothing. I didn™t get since I was there. He says, you were there eight days and y-you didn™t get nothing? He says, go to the shl Œ Lagerschreiber. The Lagerschreiber was the accountant who let in Œ who ope Œ when you opened up the gate, he counted the people coming in and going out. He made sure that everybody Œ that™s whats the Œ the Œ the Schreiber, the Lagerschreiber. And he Œ he told me to ask Œ he gave me my Œ my bread, everything, I should go and ask him for it. I went over and asked him for it, he came downstairs from his Œ from his booth upstairs and he came over and I told him what my barrack leader said. He got ahold of me like this, gave me a bloody mo uth. I came back with a bleeding mouth. I went back and told Œ I told th-the Œ the lead Œ the ba Œ barrack leader what Œ what I got. He says, well I don™t know what Œ what to tell you, but I™ll try to help you. I™ll give you some of the barrels to lick out after Œ they were wooden barrels of soup. After everybody has the soup, I™ll give you to lick out the barrels. So I remember for a couple of days I kept on licking out the barrels. Spin Œ spin of Œ some of the wood would come off, you know, splinters, and I would just eat it like bread, I Œ like food, I didn™t even Œ I just swallowed everything what came in. And I got Œ Q: How come you didn™t ge t your normal rationing? Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 52A: Because he ate Œ he sold it for Œ for cigarettes, the guy up on th-the scharl Œ Lagerschreiber. He did something with it. He Œ be Œ maybe he ate it, he sold it for cigarettes. Q: So how long were you in Œ A: Landsberg ? Q: Landsberg , yeah. A: Yeah, okay. From there I was Œ I was told that I have ki Œ if I cannot go to work, some of the prisoners told me, if I go on a pa Œ role call, to stand straight, because they™re Œ they™re expecting Œ a couple da ys later, that one of the days they™re expecting a health inspector. So, I was standing straight, but of Œ of course, I couldn™t move my arm, I was sideways. An d I was worried that if they get Œ the inspector sees me, I™m going to Œ either he ™s going to say I™m not Œ no more good to work, they™re going to put me into the death barrack. But luckily there was no inspection that day. But they asked for volunteers. They asked for volunteers and we went to dig trenches for Œ for the German SS in the forest. We fixed the streets and so on. Q: In Landsberg ? A: In la Œ in Landsberg. Then we Œ they asked Œ the next day they asked again for volunteers, something else. I always hope there™s going to be better days. If I Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 53volunteer maybe I™ll get a better treatment or more food. I always hope for better, but I Œ I always gambled, and I was never Œ never had any luck. This time we Œ they took a transport, oh about, I Œ I Œ two, th ree truckloads. And we Œ they took us to Landshut camp. Landshut camp was a Œ a German ammunition place, they storage ammunition. They emptied out a few of th e blocks Œ a few of the barracks they emptied out and they put in some of the prisoners in air Œ he Œ in case the American bombs Œ bombers bombed that area, they blow up, we™re going to get blown up in it too. In the meantime, the SS were there with their ammunition and we were there working also. We were at there, or we were at work. So we were taking by truck to a railroad s-sta Œ we were taking by trucks, not knowing where we were gonna go. Here we™re traveling through the forest Œ Q: That was from Landsberg to Œ A: To Landshut. It™s a Landshut camp, yeah. It wasn™t too far away, but it™s called Landshut camp. Then we went down to, by truck, two truckloads went down to Œ through the forest, we didn™t know where we were going. We asked the Œ the SS, where are we Œ where are you taking us? They didn™t say where, they said, it™s none of your business. So we just Œ we were quiet and we were Œ th-they didn't hear a whisper. We go through diffe rent dark places and here is Œ we were just shooking up, with Œ they™re probably going to kill us someplace. We came a little closer, we Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 54see smoke going up. Uh-oh, there is the ch imneys and there™s Œ there is another place where they kill people. We finally came, after 45 minutes or so, we ca Œ finally came to a place where there was Œ you could see civilians, homes, displayed stores. My God, we felt the Œ already relieved, oh, they™re not going to kill us, we Œ there™s something different here, w-we Œ we see it Œ I haven™t seen a Œ a woman for Œ for over a year. And here is a Œ I am staring at them, it™s a ma Œ it™s a pleasure. Then suddenly we™re cross Œ crossing over railroad tracks and we are Œ as we crawled over railroad tracks we see smoke coming up. Right away we thought, well, th-this is something different. We™re probably going to work here because they bombed Œ th-the trains are all bombed a ll over, smashed up railroad tracks. As we walked Œ we got out from the trucks. We wa lked towards the direction of where that bombing was. We saw aftr Œ a freight car op ened up, one of the boxcars, spilled out white powder. We didn™t know what it was at that time. But we walked in that direction, and it was smoldering, that white powder. Then suddenly one of the guys, some of the guys started to smell like Œ they said it Œ they said it™s burning sugar. Just like that, they se Œ they said burning sugar. And there all of us, all the prisoners just started to run on that direction. We were falling on our faces. We kept on running and running and running. And we got there and sure enough, it was sugar. We kept on grabbing in handfuls hot sugar. I remember grabbing hands, boiling Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 55sugar, we just kept on shoving it in. My mouth was burning and my hands were peeling off, I just kept on shoving it in, and the SS were pounding on our heads with their Œ their rifle butts because we were eating the sugar. This time at least Œ Q: What exactly happened? You were taken to Landshut camp to work, and there was a bombing Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ that bombed that train and Œ A: That™s right, they needed to clean up, they needed work. Q: Ah, I see. A: Yeah. Q: They needed to clean up that Œ A: Sure. Q: Œ that [indecipherable] A: That™s where they always used us, for places where they needed work, slavery. Q: And that™s where yo u Œ you got the sugar. A: That™s right, we got the sugar, it felt so great. Even so, the Œ the par Œ the SS were pounding on our heads. Th-Th-Th Œ most of the time they pe Œ beat us for nothing. This time they beat us, at least we enjoyed something. So it felt good, but Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 56then we worked there, you know, tur-turning over th-the railroad cars and cleaning up the mess. Then we went ba ck there again, and we worked on the railroad tracks. Q: And where did you sleep in Œ at night? A: At night we went back to the camp. Q: To Landshut? A: To Œ to Landshut camp, yes, Landshut camp. Q: Uh-huh. How far was that from Landsberg? A: Oh, about an hour drive. Q: An hour. A: Ab-About an hour drive from there. Q: So how long were you in Landsberg ? A: In Landsberg , about th-three, four weeks. Q: Three, four weeks. A: That™s all. Q: And in Landshut? A: Landshut ? Oh, I don™t know, the Œ Landshut , it was very short time, maybe about three weeks, because th-th Œ let me just ke Œ go back again Œ Q: Sure. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 57A: Œ because that™s something interesting. One day while we were working, the sirens were going, the American bombers came. They ri Œ the SS told us to run and the soldier ran Œ ru-run into the forest. We ran into the forest, a few minutes later we see the American bombers diving. We could see the bombs falling and we are so happy we are gonna be free by the Amer icans. We didn™t even know who the Americans were, but we were Œ we were happy about it. Then there was another time we came out to work, this same thing happened, the American bombers are again there. This time they™re blowing up the railroad tracks. Everywhere you go they™re blowing the Œ everything is on fire. You don™t see a soul no place. After it was first finished, it was quieted down, some of the prisoners started to walk around as, you know, walked around to see what™s happening. As we wa lked through Œ we came over a Œ we walked over a railroad bri dge, and on the left hand side there was about 24 small planes. The American bombers Œ we still watched how the American bombers were using that 44 machine gun, I don™t know what they call it, but they were machine gunning the Œ th-the gas tanks and blowing up all the Œ all Œ all those planes. I would Œ kept on watching th em, how they were blowing up like Œ Q: Which planes, the German planes? A: The German planes, they were popping up like Œ like popcorn, they were just blown up right after one another. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 58Q: What time of year was it, do you remember? A: It was sometimes in April? Q: ™45? A: Yeah, ™45, April ™45. And then we went back to our truck, our truck was blown up to pieces. Our truck wasn™t there, so we didn™t know what to do. A lot of the prisoners escaped. I was afraid to make the escape, I could have escaped too, but I was afraid. I was afraid because of being beaten and I couldn™t take no more pain, because I still felt the pain in my head from the lead pipe and beating all the time at work. So I was afraid, I didn™t want Œ want to gamble. We finally got a truck, we came back. Here we Œ we are going Œ the next day we went out to work to build agai Œ to dig again branches for the German soldiers. We are not getting any more food, it™s already three or four days, we™re not getting no food, we didn™t go to work no place. We see the Germans are removing out their ammunition, we watch Œ were watching them taking it out. Q: So there was no supervision any more Œ A: N-N Œ oh yes, the commanding officer wasn™t there, no, the commanding officer wasn™t there, but he was still in charge. When we went out Œ when we went out to Œ to dig the trenches, he would come out w ith his motorcycle to inspect. He would bring along a 15 foot white, long whip like you train animals and he would whip us Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 59from Œ from far away he would flip Œ whip us. But I Œ I Œ I remember I couldn™t work too much because of my shoulder and I kept on Œ the minute I saw the Œ the whip coming, I bent down and you know, I felt sorry for the taller prisoner who got hit. But he would just take it out on the prisoners because they were losing the war. After awhile Œ nek Œ it would Œ didn™t take too long, we see the bombs are flying, it di Œ it lights up the skies, artillery, it™s goi ng crazy. It Œ suddenly, we were ordered next day to march to the railroad sta tion. We came to the railroad station Œ Q: The railroad station in [indecipherable] A: Y-Y-Yes, Landshut™s rail station. They loaded us in in Œ in boxcars. We didn™t know where we were going. They closed up the doors. We are Œ as we made Œ we came Œ we dro Œ traveled about 25 minut es, the train stopped again to let go by a German train loaded with ammunition and Œ and artillery, everything is loaded. You could see their Œ their faces are sad, they Œ they Œ they know that s-something™s wrong and they don™t like to go the Œ thos e places. But the Œ one of the locomotive at that station went in to got some water. After he left, I was a may Œ maybe about a one of Œ and a half car away from Œ from that spout, and there was another sp Œ prisoner also with me. And I Œ I said to myself, boy it would be nice if I could go over and take a bath inside the tank, or just take a good drink of water. So after he left, I ran over and that other guy, the other prisoner ran over too, were holding up Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 60our ma Œ hands to the drip, the drips were coming in. And it felt so good to have a couple drops of water, it felt great. And the SS were chasing us b ack to our Œ to our freight car Œ to our cars. So I didn™t Œ but our guard was helpfu l. Then we took off again. We k-kept on going for maybe a nother 35 Œ 40 minutes on the train and suddenly we are sh Œ moved in, and the train made a sudden stop. We didn™t know what happened, whether it was a Œ just everybody was falling on top of another. Before it if Œ if Œ in a few seconds later we hear the bombers are diving in, bombing our train. The American bombed our train by mistake. They knocked out lik Œ locomotives, a lot of the pers Œ a lot of casualties were there. And after the first time, they came back the second time, some of the prisoners threw their stripe uniforms on top of the Œ of the Œ of the box cars. When they came back they turned around and took off. Q: Uh-huh. A: But the Œ we found out that one of the trains, German trains that was chasing a German art-artillery train and he Œ they went by and they got us by mistake. That™s what we were told. But anyway Œ Q: Did you try to run away during that time? A: Well, no, I didn™t, but maybe somebody else did. I was afraid. I was afraid because I wanted to come back alive, I Œ my father™s Œ I wanted to see my father Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 61again and I had also hope that some of my family would sur Œ survived. We took o Œ tha-that train was out of commission, we couldn™t go no place. Everything was a Œ had a Œ we were just waiting. The SS didn™t know what to do with Œ with us. The commanding officer is gone. We were just sitting in front of the freight cars and talking. It came later in the afternoon, the SS commander Œ officer comes to me, he says [indecipherable] boutonnière and with his [indecipherable] in his hand, and he said Œ oh, no, the SS hollered, oh, everybody I Œ in attention. Everybody th Œ is at Œ is at attention, and we™re shaking fr om fear because he would only come when Œ when there are bad times, when something Œ somebody did something wrong or he™s going to do something bad. He says , you are a-all liberated, you are free to do wherever you want. Oh my God, are you sure? You heed a Œ he-heard wa Œ you heard a you sure and everybody started to run over the railroad tracks, and wheat field, corn field. I remember running with a few other prisoners over the railroad tracks and we ran into wheat fields and cornfields and while we™re running, I see some other ama Œ prisoners who are runnin g with me are falling down. I said run, run [indecipherable], but they Œ they didn™t get up, another fell, another one fell. And ga Œ they didn™t get up. I just kept on running, I said to myself, maybe they™re weak, they cannot get up. I kept on running . I saw a sign while I was running, I saw a sign [indecipherable] and then I saw a big building in there. I ran towards the Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 62direction. I came in to Œ toward that building, there was a little delicatessen in there. I ran in the side of delicatessen, the owner over the counter got ahold four slices of white bread and gave it to me. I squashed it together like a Œ like a piece of ball and I just shoved it down, I could hardly swallow it, but I Œ it went down. Q: You were still with your prisoners uniform? A: Oh yes, prisoner™s uniform, yes a Œ my skin was coming off for Œ from dirt. We never got a Œ took a shower or anything. Th ere wasn™t enough water to drink. Lice crawling on Œ on our lower Œ black, everything was black. So he Œ he Œ he gave me another tats Œ he turned around and ga ve me another one. Two guys are sipping their coffee and talking and they™re looki ng at me like a Œ somebody Œ a wild animal walked in in here, th-th-th-they couldn™t see me Œ Q: They were German? A: Germans, yeah. So all of a sudden I h ear ooh hoo, ooh hoo, the ger Œ th-th-the sou Œ the si-sirens are going. So suddenly th-the he Œ the German over the counter says, laufen zie(ph) he says, run into the barn an-and cover yourself up with straw. The two men got up from the Œ from the Œ who were sipping coffee and came outside and showed me which way to go, th at was about 150 feet away. I ran Œ and ran inside fast, cover myself up with hay. It didn™t take more than a few seconds, I hear [speaks German] Come on out or I™ll kill you. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 63Q: Mm-hm. A: It was quiet. He started over again [speaks German] and somebody sneezed. There were Œ he asked for one of the SS to go over in that direction, pound with a hay fork, he telled, take that hay fork and go ahead, pound in that area. They hit a Œ another prisoner with the hay fork. Q: Oh yeah, there were more than one people hiding there? A: No, I didn™t know at that time. Q: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, I didn™t know, it was just Œ there was Œ I was Œ I was there just because they told me to. So they pounded in that area there a nd Œ and I heard a real loud scream. And then I jumped up, and I saw another je Œ prisoner jumped up. We went outside with a ho Œ handle Œ hi Œ hand up, the SS is right behind our back with their bayonets, and we marched out the doo r. I see outside the door there™s a Jeep and the commanding officer motorcycle. When we came out fro-from the barn, I saw a Œ the Œ th-the commander™s officer motorcycle was in th Œ in the driveway and a Jeep. The commanding officer gave orders for the two SS to go back to their post, and while he was talking to them, the-the Œ one of the Œ the prisoner who was with me, helding his head up high, he started to run. The SS officer grabbed his gun and shot him maybe about 10 feet away from Œ from him. And then he Œ after the two Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 64SS left on a motorc Œ on Œ on Œ on their Jeep, he sat down on this motorcycle, took his gun in the left hand and he hollered at me, he says, run. [speaks German]. He says, run. If you cannot run I™m going to kill you. I started to run and run Œ ran. I was weak, I couldn™t run, I kept on beg Œ I kept on falling. He coo Œ he would cock his gun, I ta Œ I begged him please, I have to meet my father again, I cannot die yet. He s Œ kept on running, I ke Œ I kept on falling and getting up and he kept on cocking his gun. I-I wouldn™t give up, I kept on fighting to stay alive, begging him while I was out a Œ with Œ without a breat h. I Œ I couldn™t keep up with his motorcycle, but he just kept on pushing me and Œ and then he stops and cocks his gun ready to fire at my head and I just kept get up and kept on going again. We finally came to the same place where we had the liberation, that was the first Œ the place where we had Œ we got our freedom. They had Œ Q: In other words, the place where that German officer originally told you Œ gave you your freedom? A: That™s correct. The same tr Œ bombed train. And a Œ he turned me over to two SS. They kept on pounding in my back with bayonets and I just kept on going [indecipherable] End of Tape One, Side B Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 65Beginning Tape Two, Side A A: Œ two SS and you know, po-poking me in the ba ck with their rifle Œ with their bayonets and wa Œ in the direction of the frei ght cars. As I got closer I tried to get in Œ in some of the freight cars, but I was Œ it was too high up, six feet high, and I couldn™t reach it. So I kept on going cl oser, where they were slaughtering the prisoners, they were clubbing them and Œ to death with their rifle butts and bayonets. I remember I came close by to Œ to the area, I was climbing on top of the wo-wounded and Œ and dead prisoners and I fi nally got up on top, I got hit with Œ with the rifle butts several times and I go t knocked out my jaw and my teeth were knocked out.

A: And I knew that last time Œ a-all my family went except my older brother was still living and it Œ I didn™t know he was in the labor camp, and my sister I saw last at Œ when I waved to her and I got hit with a lead pipe in Auschwitz. So I was hoping both these two had survived, but u-unfortunately no matter how much I tried, I did not Œ I did not find my sist er, but I, after awhile, investigating and chasing around, I found out that my brot her, my older brother was captured in the Russian prison, survived and he is waiting for me in Czechoslovakia , Chust. So, when I told that to some my friends in there, they told me not to go because I™ll never come back again, because Russia wouldn™t let you out. You™ll Œ you™ll be able to get in, but not to Œ you™ll not be able to get out.

Today, thanks God I am not st arving and I had Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I cannot do that, I got to meet my brother.

With him I could ge t along, he was pretty le Œ easy Œ easygoing. His wife was a real anti-Sem ite. She was a Hungarian but she hated Jews. I had nothing to do with her. But I Œ I Œ I decided Œ I knew where he lived, I decided I™ll wait for him near a bridge. He usually walked, because he never drove, he was too heavy to get into a car. He never drove a car, never knew how to drive. So I waited for him at a bridge, and I got closer to him as I™m coming, I™d smile [speaks foreign language] and he was an Œ he gar Œ grabs his Œ he was going with a cane, he grabs his cane and swung it at me. He says, you dirty Jew, get away from here. Well, he was ready to kill me, you could see that face, he was Œ you dirty Jew, get away from here.

And I thought he™s Œ he™s a mensch, but it turned out to be that he tur Œ he changed unbelievable. So I finally went Œ looked for a place where to sleep and someone told me where the survivors are meeting, so I went to that hotel and I was tra Œ hoping my brother is going to show up . A couple days later I met some of the people in there, but most of them were s Œ from small towns. There were two or three from my city, but most of them were from small towns who survived. And finally my brother came a couple days late r and we went Œ we decided Œ we heard that we must leave Czechoslovakia because the Russians are closing the borders. So we had to hurry up and get out from there. Q: What time of year was that?

Q: All right, so in 1946 you and your brother decided to leave Czechoslovakia? A: Yes, yes. Q: Where did you from there? A: We Œ first my brother suggested we should try to sell our house, to see if somebody lived there and try to sell our house. We went there with our little packages wrapped up, you know, couple bundles. And he told me, he says, Irving , you wait outside, don™t come in. I™ll Œ if ev erything is okay I™ll come up to you, but if not, is Œ you wait here. He went in inside to see Œ there was sechukers(ph) they called them, Ukraines who moved in in our house, and he chased my brother with a Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 75bayonet. He told him, if you ever come back I™m gonna wait for you next time with a bayonet, I™ll blow your head off. He started to run, he said, Itzhak , run, run, run for your life. I kept on running, running an d I Œ when he told me that I couldn™t believe it. I couldn™t believe it, I was crying and I was so bitter about it. There is nothing we have got here, we gotta get out of here, this is the hateful place that I Œ that Œ that Œ th Œ if you Œ they found out I™m Jewish I survived, they™re going to kill me too. So we ran to the small gas Œ to small Œ there we had two big stations, one a small one, one a big one. From where Œ we™re cl Œ we were closer to the small station. So we got back there and we were sitting waiting for a train, you never knew when a train is gonna come, two, three hours, four or five hours. It was about one or two o™clock in the morning, we are waiting still. There were some FBI agents, you know, like, they™re not FBI, th-they Œ they called them Œ what Œ what Œ what they call them, the Œ in Russia, the Œ I cannot recall them, but anyway, they Œ they Œ th-they were Œ NKVD they called them Q: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, they were watching everything a nd checking out outside and inside. They came and checked out everybody who was waiting at the station there, their passports. Everybody™s was fine, my brothe r™s was fine, he was liberated, he was a captured prisoner in Russia, that he had this paper that he was Œ he Œ that he was a Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 76ke Œ prisoner, he was free now. But I was Œ I got papers from Germany, and I w-was born in Czechoslovakia . The papers said I was born in Czechoslovakia , Chust. They called me in inside and th-th-th-the little room in there, at that station and this one NKVD™er(ph) tells me, he says, you were born here, your papers said you were born in Chust, Czechoslovakia , this is where you belong. You™re not leaving this place. This is your country, your home. I said to him, I have to meet my family if somebody survived in Germany , I have to go there. Maybe later on I™ll come back after I™m finished. He says no, you cannot go no place, you Œ I™m sorry, you gotta stay here, that™s your home. Suddenly while were ti Œ I™m arguing with him and I™m ra Œ crying, he Œ suddenly we heard some shoo ting outside, fire Œ they were shooting, gunfire. He started run out, I ran after him. And the minute I ran after him I s-s-saw my brothe r, I said Œ I told my brother, run for your life, let™s go to the big station. We took off, ran ou Œ toward the big station. We tripped, we Œ maybe took us a half an hour, 45 minutes to get there. We tripped all o-on Œ on railroad ties, we fell in chuckholes. We Œ we came bloodied up to the big station with our knees, but we finally made it. Here we™re waiting in there for th Œ for the train didn™t come yet and we are hoping that there™s going to be room on it because most of the time the trains were Œ came in so loaded, people are hanging onto the steps, they were standing on the steps, they couldn™t get on. So I finally Œ we Œ Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 77finally the train came, we got in, we couldn™t get on. So everybody was climbing on top of the roof, so we Œ I remember I Œ I ran from one place, it was dark, it was after midnight, two or three o™clock in the morn ing. I ran from one place to another and I finally saw some people are trying to help one another to get up. I figured I™ll Œ I™ll get up too. They helped me to get up to th e top of the roof. On top of the roof you were pretty safe, but when the Russians ca me up there to ask you for money or Œ or Œ or th-they™re gonna kill you for watche s, you had to give Œ you Œ there was tsoris. There were problems. And I Œ a-anyway, the train started to move. Every Œ Q: And where did it go to? A: Everything was fine, we Œ we were on our way going back to Œ I was supposed to go back to Germany. I said, I don™t have for a pa ss, I™m gone Œ the pa Œ I know my pass is gone, I don™t have nothing. They Œ he too Œ th-the civilian took away my pass. We are coming to the small station, the train starts out, and it™s going Œ my heart is feeling ba Œ faster and faster, I hear the train is going and I said to myself, boy if Œ if we stop at that station, the small one where Œ where we Œ we were waiting, we ran away from, and th Œ th-that civilian is waiting for me, the NKVD is waiting for me, I™ll be in trouble, they™re gonna take me off. It is dark, but I wen Œ in Œ you know, you never know what those guys will do. Q: Mm-hm. Interview with Irving Schaffer October 19, 1993 78A: Anyway, we got Œ we got Œ we g-got Œ ca me closer by and the train just flew Œ just went by, whistled loud and went by, didn™t stop because there was no room no place, every seat was taken. I thank God, my God, I™m safe, I got Œ I fooled them, I™m out of Œ from Chust, I™m out of it. So we finally, on the way going, the Œ y-you could see th-the Œ the Œ some of the p Œ so me of the people would stand up and the electric wires, or telephone wire were Œ were across, and if you got up too high fro Œ on top of the roof, you were just picked up by the wire and you™re knocked off. Next to us that happened to one of the guys. He got up to change places with somebody else. He didn™t lower his head en-eno ugh, or he just came Œ he picked his head up and Œ he picked himself up just in time, when he came near the wire and he got blown off from the Œ from the train. Q: How long did the trip to Germany take? A: Oh, I Œ I don™t know. We had to transfer to Œ several times to Œ Debrecen we stopped once, and then we had to travel a nother one and then we came to che Œ to Prague. Then Œ then we Œ the Œ there Œ there was Œ it depends what kind of a train we took. Sometimes we had to go on our circuits around, sometimes they went straight, they were going different directions.

But I couldn™t do nothing about it beca use the time came that we had to leave with the border at Prague chur Œ i-in austr Œ Austria, Czechoslovakian Australia Œ Austria was going to be closed, so we had to rush out from there.

And we were ea ting the horsemeat, everybody was thro Œ threw it at the cook, you know, they said, is that what we deserve after surviving? Some of them Œ you know, I was happy to eat no matter what it is, I was worried next day I™m Œ I™m gonna starve. I didn™t argue about it. And th-there was a young couple maybe about 18 years old, to Œ a gi rl and a boy who lived all Œ near a bridge, you know, it was just like a small bridge going over.
