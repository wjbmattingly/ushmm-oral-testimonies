IwasborninMilwaukee, Wisconsin.And Ihadtwosistersandabrother,andamotheranddad.Interviewer: Theyear ofyour birth?Theodore:Pardon?Interviewer: Theyear ofyour birth?Theyearofyourbirth? Theodore:MustI?February 21,1914. Interviewer: Whydon't you tell mealittle bitabout yourfamilyand personal background; reconstructit?Theodore: Letmestartinthe place calledStolbtsy [Stowbtsy], Stolbtsy,formerlyWhiteRussia,nowBelarus, whereafamilywasgrowingup. Thefamily had ahotel,whichwas 2 usedasaway stationforJewsgoingtoPalestine.This wasatense century. Mytwosisters,notmymother,shewasaverystrongwilledperson,wereinfluencedbyamancalledZalmanShazar, wholaterwaspresident ofIsrael. Withthe pogromsinthatarea,theymovedtoMilwaukee,Wisconsin,andtherethefamilyhadadelicatessen,agrocery.The twodaughters wenttogrammar schoolandhigh school. Andincollege,oneofmysisters,Sara,SaraFeder,became friendly with awomanbythe name ofGoldaMeyerson Ihaveapicture toproveitwholaterbecame GoldaMeir.And there arepicturessomewhereinmyarchivesabout Goldataking metokindergarten. Now,itisn'tthatIwasinfluenced byGoldaatthatage,butIwasinagrouping where,asayoungster,Iwassortofpulledin.AndthatwasinMilwaukee.TherewasaPolishZionistgroup,headed, ofcourse,byGolda andmysister. AndsoIcan't saythatinmymother'smilk IwasgivenZionism,butIcertainly grew upwithitand Ihadagreat loveformysisterSara.Ifollowedheraroundlikealittledog.Andslowly,allofthis begantocometoapoint. NowGolda, afterWorld WarI,decided togotoPalestine.She toldherhusband,"I'm going. Doyouwanttocome?Do.Ifnot,stayhere." Hewent.Whenitcametomysister, shesaidthesamethingtoherhusband,andthenstopped.Andsomysisterdidn™t gotoPalestine, but was oneofthefounders ofthePioneerWomen OrganizationintheUnited States,whereforcloseto25yearsshewasoneofthe leaders.Throughout allthis periodandalsoduringthewar,whenIwasinFortKnox, anyonewhoreally wantedtoknowknew whatwashappening inEurope.TheJewishTelegraphicAgency hadallkindsofinformation, speakerscoming totheLouisvilleYMHA becauseIwas atFortKnox,whichwasnearLouisville,andasawarrantofficeradjutantIalsoreaddocumentsthathadinformation, nottoomuch, aboutthe strugglesthatweregoingoninEurope,mainly fromamilitarypointofview. Allofthis decided methatwhatIreallywantedtodoformylife wastogooverseas,whenitwasover,andseeifIcouldbehelpful.Interviewer:Whatyearareyoutalking aboutwhenyougot startedgetting information about theJewishsituation?Theodore: Thiswasafterthewarstarted,1941.IwasatFortKnox from1941, andIended mystaythereonadaythatadocument camethroughfromGeneralMarshall, andIeven haveacopyofit,inwhichthe United NationsReliefandRehabilitation Administration [UNRRA]wasaskingfor stafftobeallowed toleavethearmyand comeoverseasandworkforthe United Nations. Iimmediately put in. MaybeoneofthereasonsthatIwasabletogetinwasthatIhadhadasmallassociationwiththeUnitedNationsatFortKnoxwhenonedaywewere askedtopick30driversaboutthesameage,sameheight, andIdid it.Andtherewerecommendations fromthecommandinggeneral abouthowwellwedidit. Andwhen Iput inmyapplication totheUNRRA, Iput thatinaswell.And Ithinkthatmayhavetipped it, whenIcameoverseaswiththeUNRRA, andthat wasasagatoo,becauseitwasonashipwith400peoplethat had left thearmytogointoEurope withtheUNRRA, and weleftonthedaythattheatom bomb wasdropped.Soeverybody onthatshipwasunhappy becausetheywould havebeen dischargediftheystayed,buttheywent along.Welanded inEngland,andsomethinghappened therethatwas important,asfarasmyknowledge ofwhat washappening inEurope. Atthe headquartersoftheUN,theUNRRA inWashington,theywere veryadamantthatwe,asmembers oftheArmedForces,andtheUN,shouldnotgetinvolved inthe black market. 3 Don'ttakehardcurrency,taketraveler'schecks. Youcan't get into theblackmarket. Ithought itstrange thatthat wassomethingthatwasbeingtalked about.WheninLondon,Ineeded somepounds. The onlyplaceIcould gotowastheUSArmy Finance Office.When Igotthere,Isawalonglineof300or400men,officers,G.I™s.Igotinline. WeIwasdressedinanofficer'suniform, withatabonmyshoulder sayingUNRRA. Noneofthemhadeverseen anythinglikethat,soIwasacuriosity. And afterIansweredtheirquestions,Iaskedthemquestions.Isaid,"What areyoudoingwaitinginline?"Atwhichpoint, afellowput hishandinhispocketandpulledoutastackof,Idon'tknowhowmanytens ofthousands ofFrenchfrancs. Hesays,"I'mgoingtochange theseFrench francsintodollars,andIwillhavemade$25,000."Iwasstartled.Andsureenough,allthese men were bringing money in.Whatever theysold,Ididn't ask,whetheritwasArmystufforwhatever,cigarettes inthePX.ButwhenIgottothefrontoftheline,Ithrewmy$100intraveler'schecks, thefellow there says, "Whatdoyouwanttocome tomefor?You'regoingtogetlegalright. Yougoaround thecornerandyou'llget30percent more." Now,Itellthestorybecause thiselement wasveryimportantinwartornEurope. When IfinallygottoGermanyandIwasintheheadquartersoftheUnited NationsRehabilitation ReliefAdministration, andIwasinvolvedindocumentation andstatisticsandsoon,Ifeltveryuneasy.IfeltveryuneasybecauseIsawmanythings thatwerehappening that werecertainly notsomething Iwantedtobeassociatedwith. Namely, theUNRRA tookonasrefugees, exWehrmacht,evensomeofthesoldierswhohadbeen SS,and itwasaverycurious mix.And inaddition,they wererepatriating. The RussianscameinandtooktheirRussians.The PolescameinandtooktheirPoles.TheonlygroupnottouchedwastheJews.Andthatwasofgreatinterest tome. And I ontheside,Ikeptstatisticsseparatelytoseejustwhatitwas.AndIwasalwaystalkingtoHerbKatzki,whomyouhavebeen talking with.Andincidentally, IgotmyjobHerbdoesn't agree but therewere twoofthem, HarryBealandHerb KatzkiIhadahotwaterheaterinmybuilding inElsen[village inthecityofPaderborn],Germany where theheadquarters oftheUNRRA was,andthey didn't.Sotheytookbathsinmyplaceandthat'showIgotinthe JDC.WithinsixmonthsIdecided Iwantedtogetout.AndIcametotheJDC,andthey said,yes,they'll take you.WeneedpeopleinMunich [München]. AndIleft and came onstaffwith theJDCinMunich [München].Interviewer: Let™sbacktrack abit,nowthatyoutalked abouttheJDC.Didyou,withthe UNRRA, didyouhaveaspecificroleorresponsibility, andwasthatbasedontrainingyouhad hadbefore,educationthat you hadhadbefore? Theodore: Whatwasimportant forthe UNRRAatthattimewastohaveacadre ofpeoplewhoknewtheArmy, because theUNRRA wasundertheaegisofthe Army, andyouhadtotalkmilitarize, oldbuddy sort ofthing, and that's whyIwasintheU.S.zone. Also,thefactthatIhad amajorinpsychologyandpublic administrationgave meabackground, certainlynotmyJewishbackground, fortheworkthat theydidandthe factthat theyputmeintheheadquartersoftheentire UNRRA, whoatthatpoint hadclosetosevenmillionrefugees. However,therewereonlyabout40,000to60,000Jews,only40,000to60,000Jews inWestGermany,Italy,andAustria, veryfew.Interviewer: Atthattime. 4 Theodore: Atthattime. Interviewer: Whatwasthenatureofyour workthere?Theodore: Actually,itwascalledreports andstatisticsfortheCEO, whichmeant thatwehadtokeepourpulseonthevastmovement ofpeopleinEurope atthattime.Whowereallthesepeoplethatweremoving?Trainswerecoming dailyintoWestGermany from Romania,Poland,andCzechoslovakia,dumping the"Volksdeutsch". Those werecitizens whohadaGermanbackground andwhocertainlyduring thewardidn'tgivemuch help tothegovernment thatwas supposedlytheirs,andthey wereallthrownout.And,ofcourse,asitturnedout,thatwasaveryplusforWestGermany because thepeople they weresending werehighlyskilledfarmers,peoplethatlaterhelped Germanyintheirrisetopowereconomically. But wewereinconstant consultation withmanyareasapprehending people. The truth ofthematteristhedatathatwegotwaswayoff,wayoff,becausethereweremorepeoplegetting onthese trainsthanwereonthe books,sotospeak.AndIrecall now,myinterestinJDCandthefactthat therewereinvolved inallofthis,Jewish Armychaplains, G.I™s.Asamatteroffact,whenIcame toGermany,IwashousedinatownnearFrankfurt called Hochst[Hochst amMain],whichyou'veheardofBayer'sAspirin.Well,itwas atremendous complex formanufacturing, atthattime, ofmedication forvenerealdisease.Andwhen therewasoneevening, aG.I.came uptomeandhesays,"Iknow you're Jewish."Isaid,"Thank you."Hesaid,"Wouldyouhelpus?"Isaid,"WhatisitI'm supposedtodo?"Hesaid,"Well,we're tryingtohelp Jews.We'retryingtohelpJewishrefugeescomeinfromtheEast." SoIsaid,"Well,howaretheycoming?" And hetoldastoryofallthisgreat movement ofpeople, hundreds ofthousands,that there wasanunderground, movingpeople outofEasternEurope, staffedbywhatwascalled theBrikha,which werePalestinianJews, itwasabrigadestationedinItaly.AndwhatPalestinedidwhatthe Jewishagencydidwastodrawoutoftheranksfrom thebrigade andestablish thisorganization andbring fromPalestineotherstoreplacetheminthebrigade, sothattheBritish Armydidn't knowthatthere hadbeen amovement. Sothereweredozens anddozens ofthesePalestinianJews,allpicked forwhatitwasthey hadtodo.And withallthetrainscoming in,there wouldbeadditionalboxcarsaddedatthe end withJewsinit,JewswhowantedtofleeEastern Europe.And itwasespecially inrowsafter theKielcepogrom,dozens ofJewsinPolandwereshot,the exodusstarted.And sothisyoungman said,"Look,we'regoingtohavetopickupsome people who arecoming inandthey're atarailcenteroutsideofFrankfurt.We're goingtohaveatruck andwe'regoing togogetthem."Isaid,"Icangoalong."Andthatevening wegotinthetruck; therewerethreetrucks. Andwedrovetothisarea,andwestoppedinfrontofabunker. Itlooked like abunker. Hesays–actuallythetopwasallbombedbecause itwasarailroadstation.Hesays,"In thisbunker we'regoingtofindJews.Onthe otherhand,therearegoingtobemanynonJewsthere."Isaid,"Well, howdoItellthedifference?""Oh," hesays,"yousaytwowords.Yousay'Joint' andyousay'Amkhah' which isHebrewforfriend." Andwewalkeddownabouttwenty stairsintothisbunker anditwasatremendous areafilledwithpeople.Itwasdimly litandyoucould hardlytell,children were crying. Youcouldhardlymovethroughthe people,andboth ofusstartedfrombothsidesandsaying "Amkhah, Joint." And itwasasifthewords weremagnets and thepeopleweremade 5 outofsteel.Slowlytheygotup,didn't askaquestion, andfollowed usout.Iwassooverwhelmed bythosetwo wordsandtheexperience; Iwanted morethanevertoget intoJDC.Andeventually,Idid. Interviewer: That'squite astory.YoustartedtotalkaboutthismassmovementofpeopleacrossEurope,andyoumentioned, atleast some ofthemwere.Canyou expandonthatalittlebit?Theodore: Whenourpeople werefreedfromthecamp,their first impulsewas returnhome. And itwasn'tdifficultbecause trainsweremoving.They gotaride,justlikemywife,andshewasinagroup whowere walkingtowardsDresden,andwhenthe warwasovershealsodecided togohome.Soyouhadtens ofthousandsofJewsmovingbackhome.Butwhentheygot there,therewasn'tmuch. Thehomeswerebombed. Noneoftheirfriendswereback.Interviewer: You'retalkingaboutthe movement ofpeopleacrossEuropein1945. AndI'm tryingtogetasenseofwhothosepeople were. Theodore:Firstofall,you must remember thatthe Germanshadtaken hundreds ofthousands ofpeopleasslavelaborers.Theyweren't Jews.Theywere justcriminal no,Ishouldn't say.There were afewcriminals. Theyjusttookanybody.Orthey tookcertainskills,andpicked them upandput them towork, Hungarian farmers,Romanian tailors.They hadthebestsystemofbeing abletomovepeopleabout fortheirpurposes.Andtheymovedthem.Andtheyusedthem.Schindler's, afterall,thosepeople inthere.Soyouhadthosethat weremoving westward totheir homes, and,fromamongthoseinGermany,they weregoingeastwardbacktotheircountries. Butlet meget toour people.Becauseofthis,becausetherewasnocontrol, becausethepolice andthemilitarycouldn't carelessifanothertrain Jewswere abletocome outeasilyinto WesternGermany. WhyWesternGermany? Becausethere werethe camps. There werealotofcampsthathadbeen setupand,indeed, werebeginning toclosedownbecauseofthe movement, therepatriation ofhundreds ofthousands ofpeople. Interviewer: You'retalkingaboutadisplaced person'scamp? Theodore: Yeah.Wehad, evenintheearlydaysofmyUNRRA experience, people responsibledidn'tunderstand what was happening. Theydidn't understand that therewasamovementtaking placethatthey hadnocontrolover,becauseand,also,becauseofthefriendly officersoftheUNRRA whowantedtobehelpful, especially because the commanding generalwasEisenhower,andhehad seenhowunhappy President Truman waswhenwecomplained aboutthebadaccommodations thatJewshadinGermany ascomparedtowhattheGermans had.And therewasagroupheaded byafellow ofthe nameofHarrisonwhocame andsaidit's true. The gentiles werelivingmuch betterthantheJews whohadcome outoftheconcentration camp. Sowewereabletobringallthesepeople inthem.I'm talkingabouttheBrikha.Sothatthe 30,000,slowly,intheperiodof1946, and1947,and1948,rosetoaboutaquarterofamillion.Now, thegeneralopinion isthat thosethatwewere servinghadallbeenincamps,hadcomewithoutanything,andwere sick.Theyneeded nourishment, itwastrue.Thosewho 6 hadbeen incampneeded that.Butwhatthismovement wasbringing wasaltogetherdifferent.You weregetting Jewswhohadlivedinthe underground. Theycalled ituboat[?]. There wereJews whowereinthe partisan, hundreds ofJews.There wereJewswhowere fleeingfrom PolandandBucharestandHungary. Andthenthelastgroupandthemostimportant groupwere Jews fromtheSovietUnion.Jewswhodesertedthe RussianArmy. Jewswhohadanopportunityofleavingandtheytookit.Andso,therefore, thegroupwewereworkingwithwerenotthose whocouldn't takecareofthemselves.Onthecontrary,those whocame broughtstrengthtothethosewhohadbeen incamp. Forexample, wedecided very soonitcouldverywell havebeenthattheydecideditforustosetupaselfgovernment. Many oftheJewish armychaplainswere verymuchinvolvedinthat.Now,the chaplainswere intoGermany earlierthan wewere.Wedidn't comeinuntilthemiddleofJune.Theywerethere beforethe warended. Andsomeofthem were veryaggressiveand sawimmediately theneedforselfgovernment and aselfgovernment wassetup.The chairmanatthat timewasamanbythename ofBlumowitzwho later became theSurgeonGeneral oftheIsraeliArmy. We'retalking aboutpeople withcapacity. TherewasamanbythenameofRetter wholaterbecame anaidetoGoldaMeir.AMr. Piegoch[?]became anumber twopersonintheMapaiparty.Soweweredealingwithpeoplewho wereresponsible,whowereabletoact, whodidwhat wecouldn't do.Wecould comeintoacampandwehadourpeople incamps. Butwhen itcametorunning thecamp, theywererunningit.Theywemustforgetaboutitbeingacamp.Wethought ofitasavillage.There wasamayor. There wasapoliceforce.Therewasafireforce.There werekitchens. There wasgarbagecollection. They wereallJews. Sowhatweweredealingwith,really,werepeoplewhowere responsible.Andaswebrought inoursuppliesinthoseearlydays, thedivisionwasmadedirectly tothecamp.Theymadethedistribution. Theywere ourarmedknights. Interviewer:Question,just fortherecord, whoarewetalking about nowwhen yousaywe?Theodore:TalkingaboutJoint. Interviewer: Okay. Theodore: ThatJoint. And sothereisanotherelement. Forexample,Inoticed inthedocument theMuseum putoutrecentlyaboutthehistoryafterthewar.Inoticedthat itsaidthatonJune orinJune,theJDCwasadmittedinordertosetupawelfareprogram.Thatwastrue,but itdidn't gofarenough,because thehistory oftheDPcampshasneverreallybeen told.Howtocometogripswithagroup whohavebeen throughtheHolocaust,losttheir families, werelivingin,thebestIcouldsay,insubstandardhousinginthecamps,eventhough someofthem werevillages,howcould they comeoutofthattrauma?Whathowcould they getupeveryday,havinglosttheirfamilies,living inthesewretchedconditions? Okay. They weregivenfood,clothing, andsoon.Itwasmindbogglingthat theydid sowell.For example,webrought inthreepsychiatrists andsentthemtothelargestcamp, whichwasinPocking,wherethere were14,000Jewsinonecamp. And webrought them overforapurpose. Weweren'tsurewhat did weneedforPalestine.Whatdidtheyneedinordertocareforthepossibilityoflargescalementalbreakdowns? Becauseafterall,there wasalotweknew weregoingto 7 Palestine,then Israel.What wouldthey need?What wouldweneed? We andI'll gettoourprogram inamoment andafteramonththere, theycame upwiththefollowing.They examined about400people. Andthey came tothe followingconclusion,thatthepercentage ofpeople whowouldbreakdownorwhowouldneedhospitalization wouldbenodifferentthaninanormal society.Thatwasit.Andthat wastrue.Wehadafew,afewdozenoutofaquarter ofamillion havingtobehospitalized,butthemajority wouldn't.Whether itwasbecauseofthestrength ofanyonewhohadsurvived,butitwasalsoapointthatwecametotheconclusion thatsomethingwashappening. Itwasn'tthat wewere talkingtoallthe peopleoritwasn'tthatthecentralcommittee, whichwasourgroup,andincidentally, thearmygave them aliaisonofficer.TheyhadafullcolonelasaliaisonofficerfromFrankfurtwhodidn't speakaword,otherthanEnglish,andsowewere verygoodfriends.What wasthename?ColonelSivers,fromtheSouth. Andsuddenly itwassudden oneday wesaid,youknow, there's somethingchanging completely.Thesocialworkersbegan totalktousabout theparingoffsthatwere taking placeincamp, looking fornewlife.The resultwassomethingthatwewillneverforget.Atone point well, firstofall,webroughtinwedding rings,sentajeepdowntoMilan.Theyboughtweddingrings.Everybodygot afreewedding ring.Number twoandmostimportant wasthatwesaid,look,webetter getasmany diapersaswecanbecause we'regoingtobefull andneed it.AndIrecall inearly1948, wehada someonemadesomestatistics.

Andsothere wasamiracle.There werethechildren.Andwithchildren, youhadtochangealotofprograms.Wehaddoctors, andnevermind thequestion ofdiapers,special foods,andthe whole gamut. And the camps changed completely,because withthechildren, what elsedidthey need?Thepeopleinthecampstohaveavillage.Papers,therewereatleast adozen Jewishpapersthatwerepublished. Andalso,the there wasnoYiddishtype, sothey werephonetically Englishwords.InthebookIgaveyou,you'llsee.Kindergartens, newthing.They openedupkindergartens. Wewere involved inaveryfamousJewish actorbythenameofYabakoff[?]. Inoticed itinthe paper theotherday.

AnditwashardfortheArmytounderstand, they hadtoberesponsible,but theycouldn't. And sothere wereallkindsofrumorsthatthe Jewswere lazy. Theydidn't wanttowork. Thatthey werejusteating doingnothing, forgetting forgettingthatnotoneofourpeoplewantedtostaythere. This wasthebloodyearthofGermany. And theywere there bysufferings. Andtheminute theyhadanopportunity ofgettingout, illegally orlegally,theywent.Butthecommanding generalsaid,look,thesepeople aredoing nothing.

Itwastheonlythingthatkept thespiritsofthepeople, knowingthat theycouldleave.Anditwasourresponsibilitytocarryonthisvastprogram,notjustwelfare,butfromthecradletodeath. Andthecommitteeran everything.Interviewer: Thecentral committee.Theodore: Thecentral committee,which incidentally wasestablished basedonthepolitical schlüssel,politicalkey,astherewasinPalestine.AndyouhadtheAgudath.YouhadtheMapai.YouhadtheMapam.Youhadthepoliticalmethodology,whichpermeated allthewayintoEasternEurope,because thosethatwentwere out ofcertainpoliticalparties,andtheyfoundthatthey couldorganizegroups coming outbyhavingthis additionaltie. Well, wecertainlytriedtodowhatwecouldinordertohelp them. Besidesthefood,wewerealsoagoodtietothemilitary. Forexample, when thestateofIsraelwasfounded,then there wasnormal immigration toIsrael, exceptforonething. TheBritish Armyinsisted thatthere shouldbenooneofmilitaryagesent.Cruel.Terrible.Idon't wanttoŒ Interviewer: In1948?Theodore: Yeah,sure.The Britishhad their hand ineverything.Afterall,the headsoftheUNRRA andtheIRO wereallBritish generals, andwhoweretheytalkingto?Theyweretalking totheir home officewho,ofcourse,didn't wantimmigrationtoPalestineand even toIsrael.Andtherewasonetime, Idon'twanttomention whowasinvolved, butItalked tosomeofthepeople,othersdidaswell, thathowcruel itwastoseparatefamiliesatthisstageandthisperiodafterthe war.Andtheresult wasveryinteresting. The personwhosaidhewasgoingtoexaminethetrain,said,Iwillonlyexamine theleft sideofthetrain.Iwant allthewomenandchildren there.What youputontherightsideIdon'tcare.I'mnotgoingtolookatit.Because Ihavetocertify that Ihave seenthistrainandonlywomenandchildren havegone.And sothereyouwere.The personexamined theleftside.Andontheright side,ofcourse, werethehusbands andthewivesthehusbandsandthe kids ofmilitaryage.Anditwent.Andthenfinally whenIRO closedout,they decided thateveryone could go.The let metalkabouttheshipExodus .Youremember,theshipthatwassentback toFrance,cametoFrance,andthepeopledidn't wanttogetoff.

The Armyinits infinite wisdomallowedtheG.I™s APOprivileges. They didn't tell themtheycouldn'tbringincigarettes. Somillionsofcigarettes werecoming inthroughthe Army.TheArmy knew aboutit.Andfinally,eventually,onlyin1948didallthisend,sothat wasthree years,whentheyhad whatwascalledacurrencyreform.They tooktheReichsmarks, whichwereabout500 toadollar,andconverted ittoDeutsche Marks.Atthatpoint,Germanyopenedup.Instead ofkeeping hidden whathadbeen manufactured andnotsellitforthecheap Marks,theywere willingtosell itforthe Deutsche Marks. Anditwastrue;theDeutscheMarkdidget strong.Itwasasiffromone daythere werenoflowers, andthenextdaytherewerepeoniesalloverGermany.

AndIthinkwewere successfultothatend.Butifithadn't beenforPresidentTruman withhisdirectives,wewouldhavehadamuch moredifficulttime. Andthiswasconstantly oneofthethings thatconcerned usallthetime,becausepeoplecoming intothe camps,theywere cominginillegally, andtheArmy doesn'tlike illegal things.They don'tlikethattheborderbetween Czechoslovakia andBavariaisporous,asfarastheJews wereconcerned. Sothiswasalwaysaproblem.Andincidentally,becauseoftherealizationthat itwasaproblem, theheadquarters oftheArmyinFrankfurt, under urgingbymany agenciesinthe States, hadanadvisor inJewishaffairs, thecommanding general.Someveryimportant people were there,Judge Leventhal ofPhiladelphia,RabbiBernstein,andthey wereabufferbetween theArmyatthetoplevelwheretherewasprobablymoreinterest andmorewillingness tobereasonablethandownatthelowerleveloftheGIwhohasafrauleinwhokeeps talking abouthowtheJewsaregetting somuch morethanwepoorGermans andhe's inthemilitary government,andhehasnoloveforthe displacedpersons. Interviewer:Explain tomesomethingabout thishierarchy thatthe U.S.Armywasbasicallyinchargeofthezone. Theodore: Yes.Therewere fourzones. There wasaFrench,British,Russian,andAmerican. TherewerenoDPsintheRussianzone.Interviewer: ThenhowdidtheUNRRA, theJoint, alloftheseotherorganizationsfitinto thestructureinterms ofthepossibilityinworkingwiththe camp?Theodore: TheArmywell,notreally theArmy,theUnited States authorizedthe UNRRA toworkinGermany.That'swhytheysentoutthatoriginaldocument tolookforstaff,becausetheyknewthat the Armycouldnever,couldneverberesponsiblefortaking careofcivilians,especially thisdifficultgroup. And theyneeded help.AndtheywantedtheUNRRA. And theywere verypleasedwhen theUNRRA wentahead andbuilttheiragencyquickly andtookoverbecause the Armywasnotableto.The Army,fromamedical pointofview,wasmagnificent.Youknow,everybody they wouldmake surethattyphoidandsoonandsoforth,everybody waspowdered.They could setupmedical things.Butwhenitcametolookingafterthepeople,caring forthem, theneedsthatwere demonstrated, theyknew they couldn't. And,therefore,theUNRRA camein.The UNRRA wasgivenamandate. There hadneverbeen anUNRRA before.TheArmy had neverhadtoworkwithacivilianorganization.And alotofthemdidn'tlikeit, whichwasprobablyoneofthereasonsthatthepicture Ishowedyouwiththe sixgenerals,alloftheUNRRA, that's thebrassthatwas thereinordertointercede. And sotheUNRRA wasgivenresponsibilityoflookingafterthecamps, maintainingthecamps,getting thefoodcouldn't swim.Youthinkoftrying tofeedArmy, theten andonerationtochildren andtowomen.Itwastoomuch,really.Butthat's whattheyhadattheveryoutset andthat's oneofthe reasonswebroughtinasmuch foodaswedid.Thenthemilitary wasalsoresponsibleforsecurity.Now,security,anything.They raidedcampsandwere verymuch upsetthatthepeopleweresmarterthanthey. They didn'tknowone DPfromanother. The Army,forexample, rations, that's agood Armyway.There'sacamp,let'ssayWolfitzhausen[Wolfratshausen?]had2,000,men, 12 women,children.Theyneed rationsforawholemonth. They need somanygallons ofthisandsomany tonsofthis.And thatwasit.Butwhenitcametotheutilization ofthefood,theArmy didn't haveanykindofknowhow.They couldn't sendintheirownside.SothiswasUNRRA's responsibility and UNRRA hadtoknoweverything.

TheUNRRA hadtoaskpermissionfromthemilitaryanditwasn'tuntil Junethat wecamein,forwhatevertheir reason.They hadmanyreasons,communication. Theywereafraid,still, thatthere mayhavebeenanunderground. Weweretold whenwewereriding inthe jeep,neverridewithyourfrontglassdown,keepitup,becausetheGermans hadput wiresacrossandsoon.Sotherewasthedanger aspect,overexagerated, butmilitary hasto,youknow, securityissecurity.And finallytheUNRRA hadtoputintomotion aportionoftheirorganization 13 tolookafterus.Notthatweweresoterrible,but weneeded housing. Weneeded uniforms.WewantedtobepartofthePXand,ofcourse, that's where thearmy,rankledwith civilians,wasgoingtothe PX.What I'm sayingisthatattheoutsetallvoluntaryagencieshadadifficulttimegetting in.

Theodore: UNRRA hadbasicresponsibility forfeeding, forclothing,medical, butthere waslowstandard.The averagecaloric menu was about1,200caloriesaday.That isnotmuch. Andtheywere badcalories, asItoldyou. Theyweregivingusthetenand oneration thatthearmyputout,whicharenumberedtencansofHungariangoulashorwhatever, thecigarettes, inthese boxes. Andsotheleveloffoodwasverylow.And,therefore,wemadeprovisions forbringingfoodin.They probably usedtheir cigarettes forpurchasing, whichisallright.

Theodore: Well,onthat, I'mgoingtogiveyouexact figures because Iknewyouweregoingtoaskit. Interviewer:Well,therewere alotofcamps. Iwonderhowmanyofthemyouwereabletobecomeinvolvedwith. Theodore: Personnel,inJanuaryof1946, wehad44employees. InJanuary of1947,wehad 294.AndinJanuary of1948,wehad560employees.Butthatdoesnotinclude allthe workersinthecamp. These werepeople whowere responsibletous,whowere our 15 channel tothe people. Wehadlet's see,in1946wehad38employees whowerefromtheUnitedStates.

Andwhentheybegan leaving,thingsbegan getting moredifficult.Wehadtotakemoreresponsibility.Interviewer: Weretheyresponsibletocommitteeswithineachcamp? Werethere alsocommitteeswithineachcamp,selfgovernment? Theodore: Theyweren't responsible.Thecommittees inthecampwereresponsible tothem.That wasthechannel. Interviewer: Buteachcamp hadaselfgoverningcommittee. Theodore: That'sright. Allofthem tied intothecentralcommittee. Theydidn't alwaysagree. Therewere arguments andsoon,but itwasanormal kindofreaction thattheyhadtoeachother.Butwhenthingsgottoughandwhen people began beingmovedaround, thecommittee wasveryimportant. Becauseatonepoint, the armyorGerman government saidwewouldliketoconsolidate thecamps, because afterall,there wasalotofallthesepeoplecoming fromtheeastthatwere livingpretty badlyand they wantedtohave these. Andthat wasalso apointwhereJewswere movingout.By1948and1949,American immigrationhadset up oritbegan,based onwhatwascalledtheTrumanDirective,that anybodywhohadbeen incampwouldhaveapriorityinimmigratingtotheUnitedStates.So,thatwasthe atmosphereatthatpoint.The committee, ofcourse,wouldlike wouldhaveliked themalltogotoIsrael,but notallthepeoplewanted that. They had many hadrelatives intheUnitedStates. TheyhadfriendswhowerenotZionists.Butwhenitcametocommittees thatvisitedthecamps, theywere allunited. They allwantedtogotoIsrael.

Anditneverhappened again.And thatdidn't make usexactlyheroes, becausewewerestupid,butithappened just thatway.And sothearmyknew whatwashappening. Alltheblackmarketweknew, weweren't involved.Itwasn'tourresponsibility, andthecentral committee statuswasraisedbythe factthattheyhadbrought about thisreactiontotheuseofGermans,becausethiswas1947,late1947,early1948.Anditmadeheadlines intheUnited States.The military government wastoldinnouncertain terms thattheyhaddonewrong.Sothiswasthecommittee. Interviewer: WhenyoustartedworkingwiththeJoint in1946,what wasthesituation inthecamp?Weretheyprettywellorganized atthatpoint?Theodore: Yes.They certainly wereorganized.Wehadnotyet cometoour fullcapacity ofbringing insupplies.Now,itwasverydifficult.YoucanonlylandinFrance orinHamburg.

Interviewer: What howimportant was theDPexperience inEurope andyoureffortstohelptheminterms ofestablishing foundation inIsrael?

Itwascomingfromliving inlimbo,whichitwas,livinginanareathat theywantednopartof,wheretheycouldn'tput theirrootsdown, andcomingtoIsrael wasablooming fortheir lifetime. Asfarasmyexperience isconcerned, Icertainlylearned agreatdealaboutmessandhousing andkosher food.And thefirstthingthathitmewhenIwassenttoVienna, wasrightafterthe Hungarian Revolution,about25,000Jewscameacross theborderandcame directlytoour office,waitedinline.There were afewwomenwhohaddeadchildren they were carrying,andwithinaveryshorttime thatproblem waswellhandledbyuswiththeknow howthatwehadhad.And,ofcourse,there wasalsoanotherthingthere thatchanged history.Ihaven'tmentionedthat immigration wasnotaneasything.Medical, youcouldn't haveTBorotherdebilitating diseases.YouhadtotakeasecurityexaminationbyCIC.DidyoueverwatchaCommunistParade?Why?Anditwasnoteasy.ItwaseasytogotoIsrael, buttogototheUnited Stateswasaterribletime. Andsomething happenedinthatthey didn'tchange atall.In1957, aguybythe nameofNixon wassentbyEisenhower tolookatit.Andhesawatomic scientists, andhesawhighlyprofessionalpeoplewhoanygovernment wouldtake quickly.
