For me, it was touching heaven with my hand, for hi -him it was no big deal. Probably th -thought I was a Œ a jerk. Q: Was it because you came from different social classes? A: Mostly. He had a chau -chauffeur come and pick Œ pick him Œ pick him up from school. He was a Œ a very brief per -period of high school, where my father went overboard, and spent the money to send my twin broth er and myself to private school. Q: Oh.

Well, here is a question that I™ve got. You said earlier that you weren™t very political, you weren™t pa ying much attention of what was going on in, you know, in Italy , politically. You™re interested mostly in girls. Your father is the one who forced you to be drafted, and then you could leave that. How did you come to know, or come to believe that the allie s would win the war, and the Germans would lose it? That™s thinking about strategy, about military, about where the war is going. Not everybody would have had that opinion. They would have just slogged on. A: Well I Œ I had that opinion from day one. It was a given. As far as I wa Œ was concerned. Q: Why? A: And when we were talking about this fo Œ this time Œ Q: Yeah? A: Œ the allies were at the gates of Florence . The guy was idiotic to say that they were going to win the war, when the best that they could do was a better part of the country. They already said we Œ we don™t n Œ we don™t Œ we don™t believe.

Did most Italians who were now in this situation, as you were, were they also very kind of, nah, the Germans are going to lose? Or were they working for it? A: I can™t sp espeak to that, because I never really investigated. Q: Oh, this is a Œ a little bit Œ excuse me, let me pull this up like that, and like that, and then we do this. Hang on, j ust like that, okay. That™s the microphone. Does it Œ A: I never investigate. Q: Okay. A: And the mo Œ the man that Œ that Œ [knocking] Come in! [break] Q: So, we were talking about Œ about exactly what that German officer said, and how he was Œ he was tel ling you about going up that mountain, and you responded, and saying, well, if I had a good pair of shoes, I™d run away instead, rather than climb up that mountain. And they gave you four and a half years in a concentration camp. Is that correct? A: Yes, but I didn™t hear it well enough to say yes or no. Q: Okay. A: You speak a little too Œ too soft. Interview with Elio Grande March 3, 2015 76 Q: Soft, okay. So I™ll try louder. You got four and a half years at that court -martial. A: Yes. Q: For a concentration camp. A: Right. Q: So tell me, what happ ened then? After Œ after that sentence, what happened to you? A: Good question. Q: Did they take you to the concentration camp? A: No, then Œ what did I say? Q: It says here, you™re transferred in early December, 1944, you™re transferred to the Bolzano concentration camp. A: Yeah. But what after that?

So tell me, what was that like, in the camp? A: Pretty rough. Very basic. We had a big pot of dirty water, which was called Œ I just had Œ had it Œ Q: Soup? A: Œ for lunch. No. Why Œ this Œ you open the Œ Q: Ah, it was like coffee? A: No, the one in the paper. Q: A Œ ssugar? It was some sort of sweetener in the paper. A: No, no, no, no. What I ate was in a Œ in a big bowl. Q: Okay, that was soup. Soup. A: No, that was Œ anyhow, it™s not that important. They took me to a concentration camp. I was there less than a m onth. Q: Okay.

But I was there only wi Œ briefly. Now, I don™t re-remember whether it was much more than a Œ than a month. Q: Okay. A: Or maybe not even a mo Œ a month, because all of a sudden, they put me on a truck, and they send me north. Q: Okay. They sent you north? To what place? A: Wait a minute. There is so -something wrong. Q: Okay, shut Œ all Œ all right, what do you think is wrong? A: I went n -north, but it happened earlier. I don™t really recall. Q: Okay. Here it is that in November of 1944, you are tried for treason, at Soprabolzano . A: Yeah. Q: And then you™re transferred to the Bolzano concentration camp. And then you™re transferred to a place called Sterzing , or Œ or Sterzing , but Sterzing , southern Tyrol . That™s in early April. A: Sterzing . Interview with Elio Grande March 3, 2015 80 Q: Yeah.

One was a president of the labor union for the whole shebang, and the other one was the president of labor union of the auto Œ auto mobile workers.
