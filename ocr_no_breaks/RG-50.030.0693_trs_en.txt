Well, I was Œ I must have been six, maybe I Œ I™m Œ I don™t ha Œ have exact memories or Œ ma ybe I went to school or s Œ school in Tann over there, or started in Tann. Then in Nuremberg I went to school that was associated with an Orthodox synagogue. I b Œ and then later on Œ all right, I se Œ I think the Œ the arrangements, or the Œ the setup for schooling in Œ in Œ in Nuremberg was you go four years in el-elementary, and then five years in high school. Or it used to Œ I think it used to be six years, but under Hitler they cut it short to five years. And I Œ I Œ I believe later on Jewish children couldn™t stay Œ go to public school as I™m Œ anymore, so that I Œ a Jewish larg er school was formed, and my ti Œ and my father was teaching there. So, if I remember colle Œ correctly, I probably stayed in the Orthodox school for about four years. And I remember I was in my father™s class for one year. Q: Oh my. What was that like? A: So Œ pardon? Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 15Q: What was that like, having your father be Œ A: He was very strict with me. But he was a very good teacher, and so I think after the fifth year, I went to high school for four years in Œ in Fürth. Yeah, there was a real Œ a Œ a Jewish high school in Fürth. Q: What did he teach? Remind me again, what was it Œ what subjects Œ A: The whole curriculum for a fifth g-grade. Q: Oh, so everything from math, to history, to science, to Œ A: Ri-Ri-Right, right. Q: I see. Okay. A: In the Œ when I was in the Orthodox school, I also was in the choir in the synagogue; we had a boys and men choir. I still remember s-something o-o Œ you know, I still reme Œ I still wish Œ see it, you Œ Q: Did you enjoy that, being in the choir? A: Yeah, I liked to sing. I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it. And then later on in the schooling in Œ in Fürth , in the high school, we used to take a streetcar from Nuremberg to Fürth every day. Q: And how long would that take? A: Oh, I don™t Œ maybe a half an hour, o-or y Œ maybe even less. Q: Now, when you were in high school, Hitler was already in power. A: Oh yes, right, right. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 16Q: So were there any incidents on the streetcars? A: No, I Œ I don™t re Œ I was thinking about that the other day, I don™t remember any. I don™t remember any. Q: Do Œ do you remember Œ do you remember when Hitler came to power? You would have been eight years old, or seve n years old. Do you remember whether it was talked about at home? A: I don™t remember what ta Œ we talked about at home. I remember, you know, the Œ my parents, they were really aware of Œ you know, they Œ they kept up to date with the newspapers and I remember Hindenburg and Hitler taking over, but n-no details, you know Œ Q: No incidents stick out in your mind? A: No, no, no, no, no, no. You see, su Œ in Œ in some way my Œ my father was not too much involved in it, by being employed by the Œ a main synagogue. While others, who had businesses in other Œ b oycotts, and smashed windows, and that kkind of stuff. So Œ Q: When was the first time that you felt pe rhaps a bit of danger, a bit of insecurity out in public? Or did you? A: I didn™t Œ I Œ I Œ I really didn™t. You know, Nuremberg was the Œ the big [indecipherable] you know, every year they had a huge Œ Q: Rally. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 17A: Œ a Œ a rallies, and even there, we-we even went to watch them marching through the towns. Q: Really? A: I mean, the Œ we didn™ t pu Œ you know, from the distance, at least. Q: What did you Œ what is an image in your mind of what you saw? A: Well, hu-huge crowds, and Œ you kn ow, marching and cheering and I mean, I wasn™t Œ I wasn™t really thinking about it. I don™t think I really was threatened Œ felt threatened at that time. Q: Mm-hm. And what about Suza(ph)? [technical interruption] Do you remember how she reacted to all these sorts of things? A: No, no, no. Q: No. Yeah. A: No. Q: What kind of personality did Suza(ph) have? A: She has a Œ a very, very fr-friendly person. The s Œ the Œ she was ver-very nice looking, very outg Œ and you kn Œ ou Œ very outgoing. As a matter of fact, they Œ the Œ somebody nowad Œ and for Œ for many years now here in the States , he collected names of people that came from Nuremberg and Fürth, and he had the newsletter every year. And in the latest one, somebody wrote in who was also in a Œ in the camp in Latvia, me Œ s Œ mentioning my father and his vivacious daughter. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 18Q: Oh. Even there. A: Yeah, right, right. Q: Even there. A: Right. Q: How did Œ okay, so you live in Nuremberg, where in many ways it sounds like you™re isolated from these monumental events, you know Œ A: Right, right. Q: Œ that are Œ that are taking place, these very unsettling developments. A: Right, right, right. Q: And be Œ your father being employed by the larger synagogue, in some ways has one, I guess, shield Œ A: Right. Q: Œ that others did not.

A: In Œ well, the Œ th-the really big restrictions came after I left Germany, you know, I Œ a-at the Œ close to the war Œ you know, at Œ when Œ wh en the war started, we Œ you know, my Œ my parents, they liked the outdoors. We had bicycles, we went on bicycle rides. We went on hikes, we went to vacations in the Œ in the Alps and we had Œ we had a pleasant, middle class type of life. Q: Even here, in Nuremberg, was there any interaction with non-Jews? A: I was thinking about that the other day and, not on my part. We had a cleaning woman who wasn™t Jewish. My Œ my father was also a musician, he loved music. We™ll find that out la-later. And he had a Œ they had musical evenings in the house, quartets, quintets. Q: Oh, nice. A: And I Œ one of the members, I don™t know if they were non-Jewish or not, then he also was, for a part of his job in Nuremberg was also leading the choir in the synagogue, and that Œ that was a mixed choir, you know, men and women.

So, you know, the Œ they were Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 24inquisitive enough to Œ to find out what™s going on in the world, you know, a-apart from what™s fed to you within Germany . Q: Yeah. Well, what I™m trying to Œ what I™m trying to establish is the beginnings of their decision to get you out of the countr y.

Q: Œ how that Œ yeah. A: There was a lot of Œ very early in the mornings, a lot Œ or maybe it was still partially in nighttime, a lot of this tumult in Œ in the street. So we all got up, everybody got dressed except me, I stayed in my pajamas. We looked out the window. And this is what we heard a-afterwards, th-that somebody came to the bakery and asked if there are Jews in the house, and they said no. So they went away. And apparently one of the kids I tangled with at one time mentioned, on the second floor, Jews living. So they ca Œ so th-they came in the house, went onto the second Œ the second floor. On each floor th ere were two apar Œ uni Œ each landing, Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 25you know, there were two apartments. So th e other party on out floor Œ we were the Müellers, and they were the Meyers (ph), not je Œ not Jewish. Q: Yeah. A: So, these people went to the Meyers, assuming they were the Jews. Q: The Jews, yeah. A: They made them in Œ in the Œ in the house, everybody in the ba Œ had in the basement a little compartment where you ke ep your coal and your wood, and you chop your wood. So they asked them to get the ga Œ an ax from the basement. So they came up, and just before they went into their apartment, they said, are you Jews? And they said no, we are not Jews, they are the Jews. S-So they came into our apartment, and they chased us out. So we went one floo r up, in the Œ you know, the next floor up, so up the stairs. And they started smashing furniture, musical instruments, split open the feather beds. The mur Œ mur Œ we had a Œ a Œ sort of a big cupboard where my mother had made jams and you know, pickled stuff, they smashed that. So you can imagine the feathers, and the pickles, and a real mess. But fortunately, they didn™t arrest my father. Because a lot of men were arrested. As a matter of fact, even people my age were arrested. I don™t know, it may come up later in the story, a fre Œ friends of ours, the son was arrested wi Œ and the father. But the son was released right Œ right away. So after that we had to move into a house where only Jews lived. So we Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 26Q: What kind of a shock Œ that must have been a huge shock. A: Sure, it came Œ you know Œ you know Œ Q: Do you remember how your parents reacted? A: They were pre Œ no, not really, but thinking back that nu Œ they were pretty cacalm. Q: Maybe for the children. A: Yeah, yeah. You know, I™m a Œ probably they realized what Œ you know, they Œ they realized the Œ I got Œ I said before, we were not involve d in having windows smashed and that sort of stuff. But this really Œ at that time it sinks in that Œ you know, that you™re threatened, you know. So we had to m ove into a house where only Jewish people lived. Yeah? Q: Before that happens Œ excuse me Œ were you able Œ able to salvage anything from your old apartment? A: Sal Œ I guess some Œ some of it, I Œ I Œ I Œ I Œ I don™t remember.

No, I mean, we Œ we knew them for many years where Œ you know, for a num Œ a bunch of years. That was the only apartment we had in Nuremberg, you know, prior to moving to that house wa Œ in Sunstrasse(ph). And there we had [indecipherable] apartment with a Œ a very Orthodox, elderly couple. Q: Okay. How Œ what was it like, that apartment? Explain first your Œ your first one, how large was it, how many rooms, and then the second one.

So my grandmother moved to Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 28another of her daughters in Würzburg , who later came to the United States, and then my grandmother came to us. Q: I see. A: It was kind of Œ kind of close living, you know, changing Œ you know, having the same apartment with a Œ with another party. Q: That™s right. A: Especially as they were really, strictly Orthodox. Q: Hang on just a second. Did your parents Œ excuse me Œ did your Œ did your parents behavior or demeanor change after Kristallnacht? Because to me, it sounds from your telling, that that was the most significant event up until that time. A: Right, right, right, right, right. Q: Is that right? A: Well, we Œ we all got passports Œ well, that was in ™38, 1938. Q: Right. A: We all got passports, and my parents must have regist (ph) me and my sister for the Œ you know, the Kindertransport . I™m not sure. We Œ the Œ the people we shared the apartment with, their name was Munk, m-u-n-k. And they had, like I said, very religious family, and they had a number of rabbis in the Œ as relatives. And one of them was in London, and I have some letters that Œ that came from Berlin Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 29and from Œ from Œ I think Berlin, and from London , that soon I wou Œ I would be going to England . Q: So, can I assume then your parents starte d talking to them about their feeling of Œ of lack of safety, and wanting to get you out? Was that it? A: Ri-Right. And you know, other acquain tances, or relatives had moved on, you know. Either they had to, you know, they were pushed or Œ or they were forced to evacuate Œ to em-emigrate, or voluntarily emig-emigrated. And, you know, they received reports from them. Q: Was there talk about the whole family leaving? A: You know Œ yes. The Œ it™s a Œ it so happened that people started to learn English, people like Œ people tried to te Œ learn a tre Œ maybe some Œ some trade.

Did you want to say something? [interruption] So, what did I want to say? So they™re in preparation for moo Œ what happ ened with school now, after Kristallnacht? A: Oh, I Œ well, I Œ I cont Œ I continued, and I think I finished high Œ high school in Œ Q: So the clu Œ it wasn™t closed down? A: I don™t know Œ no, it wasn™t closed down. It came up in wa Œ one of th-the letters I later received from my Œ my father. Q: Okay. A: I finished high school, and my father and another fre Œ family friend, somehow found a place for me and Œ Q: Excuse me for a second [crowd noise] A: Œ my father and the other Œ Q: Excuse me. Tell me when. Okay, so we were at high school. A: Right, we finished high school, and my father and a friend, they found someone to teach me and this friend [indecipherable] my friend, to learn how to weld, welder. Q: Really, weld? Mm-hm. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 31A: Yes, and I assumed that he pay Œ they™re paid, this man. He used to be an ex-communist, and he had a little shop on Œ on Canal . And so we, you know, we learned, and people came in, heil Hitler, and you had to mumble something, you know [indecipherable] Q: Were you Œ were Œ were you ready to go? That is, were you thinking it™s only a matter of months til I™m out of here? Or did you have no idea of what was going on behind the scenes, as far as the rabbis being contacted in London and so Œ A: No, you know, the Œ it Œ it was planned to, you know, to Œ to get the Œ get me and my sister, you know, before Œ where Œ my fr Œ no, my parents already registered with the American consulate, you know, for a quota number. Q: Okay. A: You know, there were the Œ there was a long line of people who wanted to go to the States, so we had a Œ we had a quota numbe r, so the eventual goal was to go to the United States. Now comes the interesting part. Th is other fe Œ the Œ the Œ the oth Œ the Œ the family who son with me learned swa Œ welding, th-the father was Œ at the Kristallnacht, was arrested and was in Dachau . And he was supposed to Œ he was al Œ a Œ go-going to be freed, if he leaves the country. So one day they were leaving Œ you know, they made arrangements, they were leaving for England to wait out their quo-quota number, to be called at a la ter date. And my father s Œ I don™t know ho Œ I Œ I don™t know what go-got in his mind. He said to me, you want to go with Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 32them? And I said, if you come along. I th ink he re Œ tried to smuggle me Œ you know, we had those letters that Œ th-th-these letters were August ™39, and the war started September Œ Q: September. A: Œ ‚39 Q: That™s right. A: So, this was in Œ this was in Se-September, when these fre Œ when these Œ the fre Œ the friends were moving to England . On that day he asked me if I want to come, he s Œ he Œ I said, if he would come. So we went, and there™s some things, like I said, I for Œ I forgot completely, but was aware of again, when I received Œ when I was re-recently reading my let Œ the letters. So what happened was, they were going on a Œ on the train to Würzburg , to m Œ get an express train that goes through Holland. And I had Œ didn™t have papers. I Œ I Œ I do n™t know what was in his mind, I didn™t have papers to go to Holland. In Holland we had a Œ a cousin living. Maybe he tried to smu-smuggle me over. I don Œ I really don™t know what was in his mind. Okay, so we were supposed to take that train to Würzburg , took an express train. And according to the story in the letters, the Œ the train was delayed, which meant that we didn™t get the express train. So when we go to Würzburg , we got another train, it stopped in Cologne . Wa Œ as we were in the station, a group of Kindertransport was going to England . My father asked them if I could travel with them, so they Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 33said okay, if Œ if Œ if you have pa pers. And it so happened that in Cologne was an English consulate. We go Œ he and I, we went there. It was closed. They told me to wait a block away. Somehow he got inside. He got a stamp in my passport. It was the last day of the co Œ the consul to be th ere. It™s the last day. So he got in, got a stamp in my passport, with a notation, see letter. You know, the letter from Berlin and Œ Q: Right. A: Œ and then I traveled with that group to England . It Œ you know, this was like miracles, one fo Œ you know, if one Œ if one would have Œ if Œ if the train, the first train would have been on tim e, I would have been at the border and not go any further. Q: Yeah. A: So, there was this Œ Q: So, but it was almost like a goodbye on the quick. A goodbye that was Œ A: Right, and Œ Q: Œ sort of Œ A: And Œ and th Œ and it was like a puzzle wh ere one piece fitted into the other. If Œ if Œ if there wouldn™t have been a Œ a children transport in Cologne , I wouldn™t have been Œ come to England. If there wouldn™t have been a consul, an English consul, I wouldn™t have got into England . This Œ th-this like I Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 34Q: So one of my questions is, what about Suza(ph)? Why wasn™t she part of Œ A: Well, she was younger. We Œ and she wa s a girl. Maybe my parents hesitated to send her on in a Œ you know, in a strange world, and Œ and I don™t know if they had any correspondence that she would be going to England or Œ Q: I see. A: You know. Later on they tried all kinds of things, you know. Q: To get her out? A: Yeah, yeah, right. Q: So did you have time to say goodbye to Suza(ph), to your mother, before you went? A: I Œ probably. I don™t Œ I Œ I Œ this is Œ I Œ I don™t Œ Q: You don™t know. A: There are certain things I Œ that I Œ I Œ I don™t memor Œ I Œ you know, I don™t remember. Q: But your father saw you off in Cologne . A: Right, right, right. Q: Do you remember that goodbye? A: Yeah, well, was kind of sad. Q: Yeah. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 35A: So when I got to England , the Œ the group went on e way Œ well, we stayed overnight in Œ in Œ in a place, you know, everybody had a little cubical. Q: Tell me a little bit about the journey. So, you Œ you have your papers, you have the stamp, you have the Œ the notation, see letter Œ A: Yeah, so Œ so we traveled on to H-Holland. Q: Was there any problem at the border? A: No. [technical interruption] Q: All right. So, when you™re leaving Cologne , do you cro Œ do you have any memories of crossing the border from Germany into Holland ? A: No, not really. But I have a Œ I se Œ sort of ma Œ I kept a little bit of a diary, so I Œ I reme Œ I had it written down, and I slept on a Œ a Œ a Œ a Œ on a bo Œ on a boat, on Œ on Œ in the open on Œ o-on Œ o-on the Œ on a boat, you know, before the boat. Then left to Ha-Harwich, in England . So then, from there were traveled by train to London. And we li Œ on the Œ se Œ sta-stayed overnight there. And then the group went one way, and I was on my own. And this was the Œ the place where we stayed, it was in Whitechapel, which is a Jewish area in London. And I spoke to some of the pe Œ the people, and this directed me to that Rabbi Munk , a-and I stayed with him about three days, and after that, he a rranged for me to be accepted Œ accepted in a place for refugee boys for Œ from Austria and Germany and you know Œ Q: And you were 15, is that correct? Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 36A: Yeah, I was 15 then. Q: Yeah. A: And that was in Croydon. It was in a girls™ school that had been evacuated to the countryside. And I stayed there for a while. And then they sent me to a school, I stayed there for t-two or three weeks, and then they send me to east London, to a rabbi whose family was e-evacuated, and he took in four or five boys, and we lived with him for a while. He find jobs for us. First, in some Œ some factory, knocking out pots and pans and stuff like that. And then Œ Q: Did the welding have anything to help you Œ A: Well, it Œ because of the welding, he found me some other j-job in a machine shop. And I had to do the welding, but I wa sn™t any good. But they took me anyway. Q: I want to back up just a little bit, so I understand correctly. You were probably on one of the last Kindertransports. A: I would say so. Q: Because the war had already started. If the British consul was Œ A: No, he was c Œ he was closed, he was probably going to leave. Q: Yeah. A: But it was still three days before the war. Q: So it was late August, late August ™39. A: Right, right, right. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 37Q: Okay, okay, so the war was imminent. A: Right. Q: Truly imminent. A: Right. Q: And when was the first time that you wrote to your pa rents and you got something from them? Where were you at the time? A: Well Œ Q: Cause if you™re moving around from one place to another, did you have an address to which they could send letters to? A: That™s a good question. I think I must have sent Œ I Œ I think maybe as soon as I arrived, I probably sent them something. Q: Mm-hm. A: And then we Œ we co Œ we corresponde d, and eventually I had about 30 letters from Œ from them. At first they sent their letters to an uncle. Actu Œ we called him uncle, but he was my mother™s uncle, in Belgium, and he then forward the letters to me. And after Belgium was occupied, my father sent them to Sweden, some acquaintance, or a Œ a friend, and they forwarded. And my mother™s sister and family were already in the uni Œ United States, so they™d send it Œ you know, United States wasn™t in Œ a-at war with germ Œ Q: In the war yet. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 38A: Œ at Œ at that time. And then the Œ they forwarded Œ so you know, so roundabout way. Q: What did they describe in those letters? A: Well, th-their Œ their life at the time. Like I said, they tried to prepare for the eventual emigration, you know, they tried the English, and e-even my mother tried to te Œ learn it, and she had some difficulties doing that. Q: So even when the war starts, there is a possibility to leave? A: Peop Œ yes, people left. He describes how ma Œ he mentions many people that left at certain times, oh this family is leaving, now this. And they Œ well, they were Œ they Œ they used to go maybe to Spain or Portugal, and to get a ship, or maybe even in the beginning to Rotterdam to Œ to get a ship the States . You know, there was no war between the United States and Germany. Th-They carried on. My father helped out many friends who left without having Œ without be ing able to take furniture or anything with them. But they called them lifts at that time, but he did a lot of footwork for them, you k now, go to the off Œ get all the proper papers to have these things sent off. At the same time one of the musician friends was afraid for the Œ so he was able to have Œ well, in the very early time, when Holland was not invaded yet, he had a suitcase sent to Holland and then forwarded to me, with some clothing and papers and photos. Q: So that™s how you ha ve the family photos? Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 39A: Right, right, right. Q: I see. I see. Did they think Œ oh, okay Œ A: Well, he Œ he hinted on the restrictions like, they had to be in Œ indoors by eight o™clock. My mother had her line out for fish , and Œ and they fished for quite a bit. But they still Œ I wouldn™t say normal life, but they still Œ he describes my sister going a ride on a Œ on a bike to a Œ with friends, and you know, described things. They were Œ they™re learning stenography, and Œ Q: Did they have any Œ did they put all th eir hopes, do you think, on that quota number with the American embassy, or were they trying other ways to get out to other countries? A: They Œ they Œ there is a mention, I think, in a letter, said they tried to go to South America somewhere. And my grandmother lived with us, and sh-she also only had a much, much later quota number, be Œ and my menti Œ my parents Œ my father mentioned many times in the Œ in the letters that he didn™t know what to do, because he Œ he didn™t want to just leave her on her own, if the family would move to States. He writes of trying to get my sister to go to Œ to Palestine. He tried many ways to, you know, to speed up getting out, without having to wait for the Œ you know, the quota number to be called. Q: Do you think Œ this is a hindsight kind of question, but do you think that the danger, the sense of danger, came to him too late? Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 40A: We-Well, when you talk about danger, I Œ I Œ I would assume Œ you Œ you know, these killing camps were no Œ weren™t existing at that time. So nobody had the faintest idea what the future would bring. I would say that in in their mind, they felt we had to get out; we were restricted, we were persecuted. But they figured, there is going to be a war, which eventually ends, an d sooner or later we™ll be out of here, you know? That™s Œ that™s Œ that™s my feeling. I mean, they Œ they tried. They tried to get out. They had reports from friends in this Œ that emigrated to here, that was not too rosy, you know. I Œ I just translated one of letters, and the Œ the Œ the cantor of the synagogue, who was here, he writes he just lost his position. He™s now selling canned goods. You know, it™s Œ Q: It™s hard for Œ yeah. A: It™s [indecipherable] you know, it Œ it didn™t pull him to Œ to ye Œ ye Œ and Œ and Œ and always grandma being left behind was on his mind, and so Œ Q: Oh, and no Œ it sounds like a hellish position to be in. A: Right, right. Q: Because there™s so many unknowables. A: Right, right. Q: How did Œ do you remember how you fe lt as you were receiving these letters, one after another? And what were you writing to them about this Œ should Œ were you Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 41urging them to leave, were you Œ were you in Œ did you men ti Œ comment on that situation, or were you writing more about what was going on with you? A: Well, mostly what was going on with me. They Œ they were in Œ you know, they were, of course, very interested in my life. I was happy to receive letters from them, and vice versa, they, you know, receiving the letters from me. And they wrote to me about their lives, and he was very active. And they still had cultural happenings. Q: Had he lost his job? A: No. Q: So they™re still with the school? A: But later on Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ later on Œ so, in this last letter I translated, the people, yo u know, in the ground fl Œ ground floor were just going Œ leaving, and he wa s Œ they were considering moving down into the ground floor, and they mentioned it™s Œ it™s cheaper and they had some reduction in the Œ in the income. And he was ve ry active in these cultural performances he put together even before, you know, before the war, where we were restricted of attending cultural perform Œ you know, happenings. He formed orchestras and he had the mu sical events, concerts, and he was leading them. And he writes about the Œ the dep Œ having a Œ pe rform in the old age home, or in the schwester haus.

A: I Œ I Œ I-I da Œ I don™t Œ but he mentioned it many a times. And then at the Œ at these performances, he acted as MC, you know, and he had that quartet singing and my Œ my sister was playing the harmonica and all Œ you know, all these details he wrote to me, and Œ Q: Did you feel Œ A: Œ and Œ and then, a-at one ti Œ we were talking about the school Œ Q: Yeah. A: Œ in Œ in Fürth. He, in one of his letters, he me ntioned that the Œ the Œ the school in Fürth was closed, and he Œ they got some pupils from there in their school. Q: I see. I see. So the school still was operating, even children Œ A: Yeah, they had Œ they Œ their school wa s operating, and even they had the service, religious service in the turnhalle, you know, in the gymnasium. Q: Did you get letters from your mother and your sister? A: Yeah, my mother™s and grandmother™s and you know, they included a few lines, or a whole page; sister, grandmother and my mother. Q: What did they write about? A: Well, you know, about they™re happy that I™m fine and you know, my sister s Œ didn™t come home in time, or they were stopped on Œ on a bicycle tour because she and her friend was riding to Œ you know, together and th -they were fined and you Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 43know, the day to day oc-occasi Œ happenings , which sh Œ sort of showed that they were, you know, still going on tours, and na Œ in a Œ nearby things, you know, for the day.

He arranged some things Œ he invent Œ he could have invented something to Œ for the windows, for the lighters and shine, you know, at night, and probably they had the Œ they had pr Œ probably had air ra ids. I mean, he didn™t Œ he didn™t talk about that, because the letters were censored many a times. Q: So did you get letters? I mean, did you get all the lett ers you think that he sent? A: I would say so. But I have about 20 - 30 letters. Q: That™s a lot. A: Oh yes. Q: That™s a lot. A: And then also, a couple of times we Œ we ha Œ we cou Œ were able to send a Red Cross message, you know, like 20 words, or something like that. I sent it, and then he was allowed to have return with 20 words, you know the Œ on his side. Q: Do Œ do you have the feeling that they didn™t want to worry you too much, and so emphasized Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 44A: Yes, right, right, right. Q: Œ these sort of norm Œ the more normal things that were going on? A: Probably. Right, right, yeah. Q: Uh-huh. And nevertheless Œ A: Well, then Œ then Œ and then Œ I Œ the Œ you know, like in the re Œ letters I must have written, you know, some Œ some Œ some things, that we were issued the gas masks in England , you know.

A: Œ and it Œ he tried to set some Œ the jokes, he was telling us [indecipherable] , but usually it was a play on words which in German was funny, but when you™re trying Œ Q: In translation. A: Right, right. Q: What were you writing him about? What was going on in your life? A: Well, you know, the Œ the Œ the Œ about the jobs, I Œ I got a little more money.

The trenches were dug and they undress and Œ and they got shot and Œ and I very often, even nowadays, I Œ I think, what went on in Œ in my father™s mind at that moment? Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 56Did he feel it™s all his fault, or he did Œ he Œ he missed out on doing something to Œ or didn™t he Œ he didn™t push hard enou gh to get out earlier, or g-get different country, or send my si Œ the sis Œ my sister to Israel. Or did he, in the last moment, think of me? Being alone, I Œ I very often think about that. Yeah [indecipherable] my Œ my other son, he [indecipherable] I have a couple of very young grandchildren, two years and five years. [break] Q: Okay. You were talking about your grandchild. A: Yeah, y-you know, th-tha-tha Œ yo u read about description of how the SS and these Œ y-you know, in the Œ in these camps, how they killed little babies and that™s Œ I get reminded about, you know, I re Œ I recall that, and I see my grandchildren, small kids.

And that gives details when they were deported, you know, November da Œ some date. And, well they declared them dead at the end of the war, you know , ™45 sometime, the date o-of May ™45 when Œ when the war was over. And they, you know, everybody Œ they had details of where everybody was sent to, you know, like my family Jungfernhof , some Theresienstadt in this book, and I Œ I have that at home with the pictures in it. Q: Who published that? A: In Nuremberg, the Œ Q: City? A: Yes. Q: The municipality? A: Right, right. Q: Uh-huh. Did they publis h it right after the war, or [indecipherable] later? A: I think it was quite a bit Œ quite a bit later. Q: Okay. A: It™s a heavy book, you know. Q: So they must have had some sort of source material, lists from the archives. A: Right, right, right, they had Œ they had the lists – th-t h-they had to Œ th-they had Œ you know, the Germans, they are precise, they had lists for everything. Also you Œ I Œ I don™t know whether they were put Œ put in the jail before they were transported, Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 58or Œ I™m not sure about that. If they Œ if it wa Œ if that happened, I™m sure they have details of Œ names. Q: Did you Œ is it Œ is Œ would it be fair to say then the last items you got from your family, sort of like th-the Œ a thing that proves that they lived, was the suitcase with the photographs and the clothes, and th ings like that were sent to you?

No, but in Œ then the le Œ then later on they Œ th-the letters arrived. These were the only co Œ later conta Œ real contact. Q: I-I Œ yeah, I have to Œ I misspoke really then. The letters would be the last item Œ A: The la-last connection between us. Q: Yeah. A: Yeah. Q: But as far as let™s say for the re Œ fo r your life, you™d have the letters and the photographs that they had given to you. A: Right, right, right. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 59Q: And no other items that Œ say when you went back to Germany, and you went Œ did you go to Nuremberg? A: Yes, re Œ orte Œ I went to Nuremberg just recently, couple of Œ maybe a year or two ago, pa Œ when I visited my son in Italy, we went there. O-Oh yes, and the reason we Œ this is an interesting point, the reason we went, they fou Œ apparently the Nazis in the Œ especially the Œ the head of the Nazis in Nuremberg , planned to have a museum of Œ a-a-after the war, of the s Œ the sou Œ those people, lost tribe th Œ of Jews. And he collected all kinds of Jewish articles, books. And they found books that belonged to my father. And we went to Nuremberg to the library. There was a whole section of hundreds of books that we re supposed to be in that museum. And there were maybe Œ maybe eight or so that belonged to my father. And they traced me through Yad Vashem, and this Œ and not Œ not th Œ not directly to me, but I had Œ a cousin of mine made inquiries also , and they went Œ contacted her in California an-and they informed them that I™m Œ I exist in New York. So we went there to look at the books, and there™s a Jewish librarian who is i-in Œ in charge of that, and we went there and we took a few of those books, I have them at home. It™s mostly on the liturgy, you know, the Œ the synagogue services. A really bi g, heavy book that my f-father studied. Q: And you remember it from before? A: No, I don™t remember that books. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 60Q: From before, okay.

So we went there and we got Œ we Œ we Œ h-he sent us some books [indecipherable] they were big, heavy books. And eventually we probably donated them to Œ that™s when we went to Nuremberg, but we went to look where we used to live in one Œ one place. Well, Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 61that was like a parking lot. Then we went to where we had to move to the house where only Jews lived. A dentist lived th-there. And sh Œ Q: So the apartment still existed, the building still existed? A: No, no, no, th-these were Œ this building in Sunstrasse (ph), where we used to live in that one ve-very [indecipherable] apartment, that was a new building.

Q: So, after the war, right immediately after, you didn™t go? A: No. No. I wa Œ there were people that we invited to Nuremberg by the Œ the municipality. Some people asked to be invited. I Œ I didn™t Œ or somehow I didn™t feel I wanted to go, really. After the war [indecipherable] but probably was the first vacation in Europe , went to Switzerland and we rented a car, my wife and I. My wife also came from Germany, but she came to the States earlier, with her parents. And we went into Germany, we went to a place called Königheim, where my wife ca Œ was born, and her Œ the family lived there. An aunt still corresponded with the non-Jewish family, we visited there.

Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 64Q: Sometimes that™s Œ yeah [indecipherable] that. A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: And we™ll Œ [break] End of File One Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 65Beginning File Two Q: Okay, so this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Norman Miller. And I would like now to turn to another track. We talked earlier about the trajectory, the very tragic trajectory of your family; your mother, your father, your grandmother, your sister. And the last time you heard from them, and the unanswered Red Cross messages, or messages through the Red Cross. Tell me, from that time, from let™s say mid-1941, what was your life like? What was going on with you in England ? A: Well, the Œ th-the Œ the Bloomberg Œ not Bloomberg, Bloom Œ the Œ the Œ some kind of Bloomsbury(ph) House, or Œ Q: Yes. A: Œ organization, they Œ they sort of supe rvised your life, so after I went to a Rabbi Munk(ph), who then sent me Œ well, he a-a pparently contacted that organization. They sent me to a place in Croydon where there were other refuge Œ about maybe 40 re-refugee boys. And then, little while later, I was sent to a school in Swiss College part of London, a Œ a boarding school, but I only stayed there few Œ two Œ a few weeks, maybe a month, and then ag ain there Œ was sent to a Rabbi ren Œ refren Œ Ferdleman(ph) in Forest Gate, that™s in the east end of London , and he found us jobs. His wife, and family was evacuated du ring the war, and they were living in the countryside. And there was a Polish girl who did the cooking and house Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 66housework. And he found jobs for us, and I worked in a factory, and then, having a fair knowledge, or a little knowledge of welding, I Œ I got a job in a machine shop, and I worked there for a while. You know, you Œ you Œ you had the Œ you start at the bottom, cleaning up and getting sandwiches and I didn™t Œ my English wasn™t tha-that good, and I had to go by the sort of fo Œ phonetic Œ how it sounded, to order the Œ Q: So you never used to Œ you neve r had proper English language lessons? A: Well, I had in Germany, I had some in high school. So after a while, the Œ you know, this was the east end, and there was a l Œ a lot of bombing, German air raids. It was near the wharfs. And so the company evacuated somewhere in the country, not too far, you know, one of the smaller towns outside. So I commuted there for a while, and then I stopped, and I got another job back in Œ in east end. I worked there s Œ it was a scientific instrument company, machine shop type of work. And well, as I said, a lot of air raids. We Œ we watched Œ i-in London they had Œ they had a lot of balloons up, you know, to make it more diffi cult to get Œ for the planes to get lower, difficult to have a straight run. Q: How would a balloo Œ I mean, this is ju st my lack of technical knowledge Œ how would a balloon hinder a plane? In what way? A: Well, maybe they interfered with the Œ with their flight plans or Œ or something like that. And then we se Œ we saw dogfi ghts also, you know, the Œ the British planes Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 67attacking the German planes, and you s Œ sometimes you saw them sh Œ sh Œ being shot down, or y Œ or you Œ at times you di dn™t know where the Œ this was the English arm Œ a German plane was shot down. So, there was a program where they had what they called Anderson shelters in the backyards of the building Œ of Œ of the houses; in the garden, they d Œ they dug a hole in the grou nd. Then it had corrugated iron, and then some more soil on top. That™s wher e we used to sleep at during the nights. Q: Wow. A: And I also was asked to sleep at our place of j Œ work, you know, under the benches a Œ a few times during the week, because they had these fire bo-bombs. These were sa Œ you know, th-they started a lot of fires, small. So we had sandbags and Œ in order to suffocate, you know, the flame. Q: Did it actually happen? A: Ye-Yeah. Q: I mean, there was an anticipation, but did it actually [indecipherable] A: No, no, sure, they had the fire, they had these Œ you know, th-they started th-the Œ the, you know, firebombs, a nd Œ by Œ by the hundreds as Œ they dropped these things. So I Œ I worked, and I lived in the Œ with that rabbi, and then he died, and then I was sent to another hostel for Œ for boys, for refugee boys in [indecipherable] . I kept on working. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 68Q: Can I ask here; what authority Œ what British authority, or government authority was the one that kind of regulated your life? A: I don™t think it was a Œ a government, I think it was a Jewish private organization. Q: I see, so Œ A: I think Bloomsbury (ph) Hall was in the name of the organization. Also the Œ the Œ I-I guess they were in charge of bringing the Kindertransports to th-the Œ to the States and find them homes. So, I lived in this place, Clapton (ph) Œ you know, I used to play the che Œ cello, and I want to something mu sical, so I bought a clarinet in a pawn shop, and Œ but I had to give it up very soon, because we slept in a dormitory, you know, a whole bu nch, and as soon as Œ that™s the only place I could practice, and you know, as soon as you try to do that, someone wants to sleep, and Œ I also had a Œ a Œ a bad experience. Q: What happened? A: You know, I Œ I didn™t earn much money, but I tried to save as much as I could, and I had a Œ a pa Œ a post office savings book, and one day I ha Œ I kept it in a little table next to the bed, and it disappeared. So I went to the director of the Œ that Œ the place, and he went straight to one particular person, and he had it. So, he must have had some previous record. So after a while Œ Q: Did that mean you lost your savings? A: No, he Œ he Œ he had Œ he had Œ he had my book, you know. Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 69Q: He had your book, but he wasn™t able to withdraw anything. A: No, n-no, no, yeah. Yeah, later on a few of us moved to a boarding house, you know, English boarding house, about four of us, and then d ecided, you know, decided to join the army, volunteer in the army. Q: Can I interrupt? At this point I want to ask, a lot of refugee kids, particularly who had been on Kindertransport, who came from Germany or Austria , sometimes were classified as enemy aliens Œ A: Oh yes Œ Q: Œ by the British government. A: Right, right. Q: So I wonder, what was Œ what Œ what happened to you? A: Well, when I wa Œ when I turned 16, I had to appear before a tribunal, and I was classified, friendly alien of enemy origin. Q: So, had it changed a little by then. A: Ri-Ri-Right, you know. I Œ I know others that were interned a-a-at that stage. Q: Yeah. A: Later on I was thinking maybe living with a rabbi, and maybe there was some Œ maybe he had some influence, or they r ecognized that I™m not really a dangerous person. So I, you know, was a friendly alien. Q: And then you Œ that would have been Œ you would have been Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 70A: That wou Œ when I was 16, that™s Œ Q: 1940. A: Right. Q: 1940. A: Right, right. Q: So, pretty early on. A: Right. Q: All right. So Œ so that experience is one that you avoided, of being interned. A: Right, yes, I was Œ Q: Okay. A: Œ not interned. And I ear Œ I Œ I Œ I made some English friends, one particularly, and he went in the air force. So, I wanted to get Œ you know, I thought Œ you know, my friends to Œ do their duty, I have Œ yo u know, I Œ I ought to do something. You know, I joined too, and I tried to get in the air force. And I Œ you know, I appeared before a board and I re Œ I Œ I was refused. It was be Œ I Œ I would say because of the German background. You know, if you had been Polish or Czech, where they had Polish people in the air force, maybe it would have been made lighter, easier. So Œ Q: Was that disi Œ was that very disappointing for you? A: Yeah, yeah, sort of, you know, right, right. So then I volunt eered for the army, and I would Œ and I figured maybe with my ma Œ ma Œ mechanical background, I get Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 71into engineers or something like that. Well, they put me in the infantry. First it was, you know, begin in London . It was the Royal Fusiliers. Then was basic training, and when that was over, th ey needed ra Œ it was already towards the end of the war, you know. They needed reinforcement. As a matter of fact, I s Œ I saw in one of my army books, a notation about Far East. I think they were going to send me Œ vaguely I remember they were going Œ you know, they had everybody lined up to go to the Far East, and I said I speak German, and then they changed by it Œ you know, sort of destination. And, you know , I had my medical basic tr aining. And then we were flown over to Belgium as reinforcement, and I joined the 53rd division, which was a Welsh division. Q: What year was this? A: It was f Œ 40 Œ beginning of ™45, you know, it was Œ Q: So the war was coming to an end. A: Right, right. So Œ and I Œ and it Œ in th e infantry platoon of the ra Œ the Œ the Welsh fusiliers. On Œ a-a-at that stage of the war, they had sort of cur Œ columns with tanks ahead, just moving until they hit resistance, or Œ you know. So, at Œ well, in Œ in my platoon already, the lieutenant found out that I speak German, so he kept me close to him. And one day, you know, th e Œ a-and afterwards, the company, you know, that™s the next stage, found out I cou Œ you know, there was a German speaker, so I was transferred to the company headquarters. And Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 72Q: As an interpreter, as a translator? A: Oh yes, interpreter, yes. You know, I still had my rifle and, you know, all that stuff. And while I was there, my platoon was riding on tanks that were, you know, just traveling into Germany , and they were ambushed, and Œ and you know, they were sitting on the tanks, and a whole bunch of them got killed, and some captured, and some wounded. So I escaped that. Q: Yeah. A: And soon after, when the battalion headquarters realized there™s a German speaker, they put me in the intelligence section of the battalion. So, you know, we Œ we Œ we had Œ we had sa Œ we still had some fighting on the way into Germany. I ha Œ I ke Œ I kept a little diary, and I put down every little town we passed through. Q: Do you remember the first town you hit? A: No. Q: Do you remember what part of the country you entered? A: Well, it was a Œ a Œ northern Œ northern Germany .

A: Well I Œ I Œ so Œ ma Œ ma Œ I Œ you kn ow, when I think about it now, maybe he was on the way to give himself up, I Œ I Œ I don™t know, because he came from the east, you know, and the Russians were co Œ right behi-behind him. So, I had Œ I had him arrested, and then they called the Œ the colonel, the, you know, battalion commander. He had his picture taken, an d then there Œ he was sent on to Montgomery headquarters. Q: Di Œ what did Œ what did Œ I mean, that™s an amazing event. A: Right. And I have proof of that.

Like I said before, tha-that Œ tha Œ there™s another Œ another incident I come back later or pretty soon, which I also completely forgot. So after that, we Œ you know, the Œ the division moved up nort h to what™s the Œ the Danish border. Stayed there for a while. And then we Œ then we went down to Dusseldorf . We were on the a -- Dusseldorf airport we occupy Œ you know, we lived there. And I Œ I Œ there was a notice going around that they were looking for people for the [indecipherable] corps.

Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 78Q: Was there any effort, was there any movement to send them ba ck forcibly, to the east? A: No, no, no, no.

And h-he put in an app lication that Œ you know, that I would stay with the Œ you know, wartime work and that sort of stuff. But I is Œ insisted I want to go in the army. Q: Did he do that to Œ for self-interested reasons, or to try and save you from Œ A: No, self-interest. I Œ you know Œ Interview with Norman Miller April 15, 2013 81Q: Self-in Œ yeah.

Taylor jumped on the running board of the car, and forced the driver, who was wearing Lu ftwaffe uniform, to pull up. There were four men in the car, and one who spoke English said he ha d papers for Field Marshall Montgomery to sign. Taylor then asked a German policeman if the papers were in order and the German replied, yes. Still not satisfied, Taylor took the occupants of the car to Fusilier Miller, the interpreter and Miller immediately had them taken before the c.o. Taylor returned to his post on the bridge and a few minutes later one of the men he had arrested was marched onto the bridge again, and his photograph was taken with the c.o. and adjutant. This man was the notorious Seyss-Inquart. So thanks to the vigilance of one of our battalion™s men, another war criminal was in the bag. Terrific. Let™s put that in there.
