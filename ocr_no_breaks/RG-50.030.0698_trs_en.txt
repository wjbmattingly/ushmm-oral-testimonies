How did life develop for yo ur family, for you and your family, how did life change? A: A Œ you see this five Œ five years was very, very difficult, because was very short of food. Light was only for a couple hours and other place, and then [indecipherable] and we h-have use [indecipherable]. It Œ it was very, very, very smell Œ smelling, but instead of light, b ecause light. And food was for people, for example, we can buy, but bread was like gr eener, like something old, some ny Œ not Œ not good, of course. And it Œ food was only [indecipherable] for eat. If somebody wants to eat, should buy from other people who brought from the country. They kill animal and they bring in. But it was very ex pensive. Some people really almost dying from hunger.

How did things happen, how long were you still in Warsaw ? What were you most afraid of, you see. A: I tell you. In Warsaw was very dangerous, becaus e they keep people from the street, take to concentration camp or to work in Germany, because a soldier were fighting, therefore, for work, they took lot of Polish people. And a lack Œ lack of food st-stress, because everybody was afraid th at they could take me in any minute. Schools was closed. [indecipherable] Only they let Œ they let to have school for Œ to Œ to Œ maybe for Œ for class, and that™s it. The idea was to keep Polish people as Œ only to work, like Œ no. Q: Okay, I Œ A: You understand? Interview with Wand a Luos Lorenc May 7, 2013 23Q: So Œ I hope I do, if I will say it in this way, that only children up to fourth Œ four classes were allowed to go to school, and otherwise all the schools in the country were closed. A: Yes. Q: And it was considered that they™re not necessary because all the Poles are good for is going to be to work for the Germans.
