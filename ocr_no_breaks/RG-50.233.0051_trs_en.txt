They have their things. The produce and the machines and everything. But there were places in Poland that they had more than now itŠa place, or now an estate or something. So he was going there and buying like variants (76). A big amounts, ten tons, I don™t know. For those people, that was much cheaper than to buy there because they didn™t have in the industrial (81) state where we were living. So that™s what it was. He was always on the go.

But the rest yearsŠ Q: So you lived a little bi t outside of Rozwadów? 5 A: Yes, yes. So the last two years, no more th an two years, my parents decided that they sold everything and they moved to Rozwadów. Bu ilt a house, two years before, this I know, two years before the war. But he was still in the same business like he was buying big amounts of grain and he makes, he rent a mill and he makes flour for the bakeries. Around the thing, Rozwadów and other places, that needed, the stores and the bakers. So this was until the war. Q: Do you remember what street you lived on in Rozwadów when you moved? A: Yes, Panska.

Let me go back just a little bit to when both you and your brother were born. Before WWI and I™m trying to get a gras p for where Rozwadów was. I™m trying to remember on the map. I™ve looked it up several times but I can™t remember. Was that part of Poland under Russian rule? A: Austria. Q: Austrian rule? Okay. Did your father fight in the war, in World War I? 7A: He was in Russia, no. He was in Russia four years. {But he was a prisoner, so he did fight.} But he didn™t fight. {But he was a soldier.} Yeah, they took him. He was a soldier because he didn™t have any choice, they t ook him and make him a soldier. Too bad I don™t have the pictures, he showed the pictures as a soldier. Q: He had pictures of himself in uniform? A: Oh, yeah, yeah. Very nice. From 14 to 18, he was in Russia. Q: Did your brother--, before WWII, I know th at Poland had a compulsory military service? A: Yes. Q: Did your brother serve in the military? A: No. Q: No? Was there a reason for that or--? A: I don™t know what it was. I think he didn™t have good eyes, good enough for a soldier. Q: Can you tell me a little b it about when the war started, what your brother was doing, what happened when the Germans invaded Poland? A: What happened was known to everybody that the German coming in the town. They start from theŠhow you say itŠfrom the doctors, lawyers, businessmen--. Q: They came for them first? A: Yeah and everybody knows that. First thing, he had a sign over the house. So that sign we had to take off. Q: So they knew he was a lawyer? A: Yeah and then they take out, right away th ey take him. That™s what they did in Lvov. He and my sister and my younger brother left the house when it was known that the German come in already in the town. Q: Oh, so they decided to leave before they knew what the Germans would do? A: Yeah, yeah. Then they were going, just walk to Lvov. You know where this stands to Lvov. Well, it™s further, even with the train you have to go four or five hours. So it took them, I don™t know. My sister went and my younger brother with him. {Your sister, Clara.} Q: They all walked to Lvov? 8 A: Yeah. How they managed, I can™t tell you. It wasn™t too pleasant but they came to Lvov. In Lvov, was already the Russians. Q: The Russians were already in Lvov? A: But the Russians were the good guys compari ng with the Germans what they did to the people. Q: Do you remember what day or how long af ter the invasion started, the Germans came to Rozwadów? A: Not more than a week. Q: Not more than a week? Do you remember if your brother ever talked about being frightened or anybody in your family bei ng frightened about what was going on in Germany before they invaded? A: No, no. Nobody knew. Q: Nobody really knew anything? A: Nobody expected. Q: Did your father say anyt hing about the Germans--? A: About the Russians, you mean? Q: No, no. About the Germans since he may have fought with them during the war, did he have anything to say about the Germans o r--? Do you remember what he thought about the Germans at all? A: I don™t know. Nobody talked too much about it. Q: The reason I asked is that some people ofte n say that their parents said that all the Germans were nice people, they had known them before the war and that kind of a thing? A: Yeah, that they, yeah. Q: They wouldn™t do, you know, the th ings that they were accused of? A: No, no, they wouldn™t do it. They said the same thing. Q: So we have your brother and your sist er and your younger brother walked, I would imagine several weeks, to get to Lvov? 9A: They didn™t have time, several weeks. I don™t know. Q: But they made it to Lvov somehow? A: Yeah. {Maybe they got rides with people goi ng.} Oh, yeah, yeah. It was that people that my father was doing business, they have a nother place on the other side in Poland. So they have a son and that son run away too. Going, my brother me t him on the way just like that. He went with a wagon and horses so he have them a ride. That what ___ . Q: But they didn™t plan to meet? They just happened to meet on the road? A: Yeah, that™s right. Q: So they went to Lvov. Do you know what they were doing there? A: In Lvov, we have friends and they have apartm ent. So the first thing they have a place to go in till they find out; they w ill think what to do. But they were staying there for a few weeks. In the meanwhile, the Germans came and told us to get out. Q: From yourŠfrom Rozwadów? A: From our house. So we start to go in the same direction. I don ™t know why they are because when they left, they didn™t know where they go and we didn™t know where they go. Q: Oh, so they didn™t have a specific plan to go to Lvov? They were ju st running to the East? A: No, from other towns they run to Rozwadów. From Rozwadów, theyŠnobody knows where to go or why they go. It was just a terrible thing to live it through. What else you want to know? Q: Did you--? Now you were with your parents, right? Was it just you and your parents or other people? A: My younger sister. Q: Your younger sister? And what™s her name again? A: Anna. Q: Anna. A: {No, it™s Hanna.} Q: Oh, Hanna. 10A: Hanna is Yiddish. Q: And you all also went to Lvov? Did you get there from rides or did you go on a train? A: We came to a little town and there we find out that a train is going, the last train goes out for that little town. So we head, I think, a ride into Lvov here. Q: When you all came to Lvov, did you meet up with your brother and your other brother and sister? A: Yeah, we met. Not right away because we have to stop in another town that the train didn™t go exactly to Lvov. Q: You didn™t know that they were in Lvov, did you? A: No, no but through people. So there were apar tments and even those people were running from Lvov too so they left the apartment. So we had an apartment. Apartment! One room. Q: One room for the four of you? And your olde r brother lived in a different apartment near you, or-? A: In the same building. Q: In the same building? A: Yeah. Q: Can you tell me what the Russians were doi ng in Lvov? Were there any restrictions on you as to what--? A: Don™t ask, the Russians was not--. First thing they take everything what they saw to take. Because they had, they didn™t have to pay. They went and nationalistsŠ{nationalized} nationalized and it was stamped, they are co ming and taking whatever they want. Q: Did your brother try to start to work or was there anything to do? A: He was working, they gave him a job. Q: The Russians did? A: The Russians did, yeah. Q: So he was practicing as a lawyer again? A: No. He worked in an office. Q: Was he doing clerical work or--? 11 A: I don™t know, I can™t tell you. But that, they did him a big favor. Because if they know, the Russians would, a few weeks later, two or three weeks later, the Russians came and took us to Russia. If he would be hom e, maybe he would go to Russia too. Q: But he wasn™t home when they came? A: He was working and my sister too. Q: How long did you stay there before you left? How long were they were? Do you remember? A: Who you mean? Q: Before the Russians took you from Lvov? A: Just a few weeks, maybe two or three w eeks or maybe months. Could be a few months, it™s too hard to rememb er all those things. Q: Do you know what happened to your brother after you left? A: No. My brother was, he had a friend, not a friend he knew because she was an older lady already but she has apartment. Somehow he got her address and he was there, he lived there for a short time. He was working. Then after the war, I was talking to that woman and she says that one evening--. They knew that Russians taken alre ady the people in the trains, not the trains, the cattle cars. Q: Taken out the Poles? A: Huh? Q: Taking the Poles from--? A: The Poles also, the rich people first. Firs t went the rich people. She says he came one evening and she said that somebody told him that they will come for him. He asked her to give him a blanket and a pillow that he ha s toŠhe wouldn™t sleep there that night. She never saw him again and nobody saw him again. Q: Would this have been in 1939 still? A: No, this would be in ™40 or ™41. {Didn™t it say in that article in the book, didn™t it say how he was working though when he was in Lvov? He was working to help other people.} Yeah, in that book. {It might be useful fo r you to have that, if you can, to have it translated.} Q: Sure, talking about what he was doing in Lvov? 12 A: {Yeah, before the war. I thi nk that™s why, in fact, they had an individual--. Not before the war, during the war. I think that™s why, in fact, he™s got that individual article in there, I don™t know. I don™t remember it that clearly but he was working to help other people to get out or do different kinds offŠto save themselves in some way. In the process, somehow, he was caught up.} Helped the peopl e, he sent in food to them. {Yeah, but that™s what he did and it does talk about that in the article.} This is a very nice article. {If you think you had it translation, could you send me a copy of the translation?}
