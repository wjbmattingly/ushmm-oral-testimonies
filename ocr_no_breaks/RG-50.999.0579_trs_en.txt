3 >> Bill Benson: I'm going to keep us in that time for a moment more. You started school in 1935, started attending a public school. You said to me that the most dangerous time for you was recess. Can you say a little bit about that? >> Frank Lieberman: We had to leave the building during recess. We had three rooms in a large public school. At recess we had to go into a large playground area. We tried to be very close to our teachers. Boys and girls were separate. And the line in between, there was a lot of heckling. It was definitely the most uncomfortable part of the day. >> Bill Benson: In 1936, circumstances for your parents turned more ominous and they became more difficult if not dangerous. What changed in 1936 ? What did that mean for your family and for you ? >> Frank Lieberman: After World War I there was the Crimean War which involved the Rafians [ph] and led, at the end of it, led to the formation of Poland. Poland basically only became -- again became a country, after the treaty of 1921 which included the Gdansk corridor. It included a treaty which protected minorities, both German and Polish, in former German territories, for 15 years, which ended in 1936. The Nazis didn't really take full control until that treaty expired, in order to protect their populat ion on the Polish side. But once the treaty was over, stores started being boycotted. They had brown shirts, blockading my father's office. He lost his hospital privileges. And you had an anti -Semitic magazine, newspaper, at every street corner, behind glass. Things really turned bad almost immediately the day after the treaty. >> Bill Benson: In that same year, in 1936, I believe your mother made a trip to Israel for a specific purpose. What did she go there for? >> Frank Lieberman: Well, as I said, my father did not want to accept my grandfather's offer so they started investigating where to go. It turned out that Israel was not a possibility. She went with her brother. There was one doctor for every 100 people. It was impossible for a Jew to practice m edicine. Doctors became chicken farmers. That was not one of the choices. This is why my grandfather found -- became a genealogist and started looking up family histories to see if there are any other places which might offer refuge. It turned out that he found a brother -in-law on my mother's side had moved to the United States in 1905. After an unfortunate incident that he said he needed 5,000 marks, which was in the six figures in dollars. For one week he had a problem. He got it and went to the United States. Never to be seen again. He did find that. My grandfather said try it, maybe there will be some retribution. He did take a trip in 1938. >> Bill Benson: Before we come to that, 1938, a couple of other questions. Your parents insisted -- it was urgent you learn to swim. Tell us about that. >> Frank Lieberman: Yes. Again, they said we would probably have to take an ocean voyage. The swimming pool would be closed after the end of the treaty. My grandfather went with me, I think about a week before and saw to it that I swam in deep water and he didn't leave until that was done. So I enjoyed my ability to swim ever since. But it had a rather ominous beginning. >> Bill Benson: You told me that you've been able to document or see the decline in your grandp arents' business, I think between 1933 and 1936 or so and it was dramatic, wasn't it ? You measure d the dollar loss. >> Frank Lieberman: Well, dollar loss -- nothing has the same value but -- now I have to add. They had a non-Jewish accountant w ho kept the books. They did locate him afterwards. The accounting figures, I gave them to the Holocaust Museum because it shows the rapid decline from about $100,000 -- I forget what the amount is, in 1933, to about 20 in 1938 when the business was confiscated on Kristallnacht, which was the Night of Broken Glass. >> Bill Benson: When your father lost his admitting privileges and his practice was boycotted, how was he able to make ends meet for the family before he left for the U.S.? >> Frank Lieberman: First of all, we lived very frugally. Money wasn't worth anything because bank accounts were frozen for anything but assigned living expenses. So we basically worked from whatever savings there were, with some help from my grandparents. 4 >> Bill Benson: And as you were beginning to tell us, your grandfather had located a relative who had come to the United States in 1905 and that led to your father making a trip to the U.S. in January of 1938 and then moving to the United States later that year. Tell us what happened there. >> Frank Lieberman: He had two stops. One was in Philadelphia, in the City Hall, where the family -- one of the family married and came to the United States and settled in Philadelphia in the early 1700s, became quite prominent , one of the financiers of the revolution, started a college in Philadelphia. He was hoping to find some trace of the family which could help. It turned out that Rebecca [Indiscernible] never married and her brother moved out west. Out west was Louisville, Kentucky. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Lieberman: He married but the family lost track and that was an area that was not -- there he wasn't successful. The son of the person who absconded the money was vice president of an organization, gave him an affidavit which was necessary to guarantee that we would not be on welfare for a year. Remember, this was 1938, in the midst of the second phase of the great depression. At that time, inc luded in the affidavit, he had an income of $38,000, which was about as obscene as some of the big figures nowadays. And that did permit us to get on the quota for the United States where we got a number right after his return in 1938 , in January. Then not hing happened. Starte d checking. It was February, March, April. He called a friend and said, ﬁWhat do I do ? I really need to move .: And he said, well, the council had a secretary, Fraulein Schmidt. ﬁI've heard if you get her a nice box of candy, that might help. ﬂ And I want to mention that in bad times, corruption is rampant. Because people are desperate. Again, for about another month nothing happened. >> Bill Benson: And he sent the chocolates. >> Frank Liebermann: He took the chocolates. >> Bill Benson : Ok. >> Frank Liebermann: And he called his friend again and said, ﬁL ook, I'm getting really anxious. ﬂ He said, ﬁWell, did you put 100 marks into the box of candy? ﬂ >> Bill Benson: He did take another box of candy. >> Frank Liebermann: He did. >> [Lau ghter] >> Frank Liebermann: And in June, we were called to Berlin to have a physical at the American Embassy. We got our visa promptly. And the visa is good for 120 days. You could only take out 10 marks, which is about $2.50. By today's standards that's probably about $50. But there was an angle that if you took a German boat and went first class, you got a pretty good, what do you call it, spending allowance for the gift shops but if you didn't spend it, you could turn it into American dollars. My fath er took the next boat and went straight to Ohio which the bar passed half of the people. He had a friend who was a gynecologist in Cleveland, was a fraternity brother, who mentioned the 50%. My father was a gambler a nd got a room for $5 a week, spent the t ime at the medical library to hone up, registered for the December state boards. And since the visa was good for 120 days, we booked at the end of 120 days, on the 12th of October. >> Bill Benson: Frank, why didn't you go when your father went ? Because he left in June. >> Frank Liebermann: To save money. >> Bill Benson: Ok. >> Frank Liebermann: In other words, he wasn't able to earn a living. My mother closed the household. You could pay 100% tax on anything that you took out so that we were able to pac k furniture. My mother got a sewing machine in case she needed -- she was good at sewing. >> Bill Benson: But she had to pay 100% tax. >> Frank Liebermann: 100% tax to the government on what anything was worth. But with that we got a lift, which is something like a container, which could be packed with somebody supervising that everything was being taken out. We basically gave up our apartment. We stayed in a furnished room during that time ; again, to save anything possible and get ready for a family reunion in October. 5 >> Bill Benson: And during that time, in the summer of 1938, while you're waiting for your departure, somewhere along the line you had an accident and broke your arm. Tell us about that. >> Frank Liebermann: Kids play tag. >> [Laught er] >> Frank Liebermann: My mother called the local orthopedist whom they had gone to medical dinners with, etc., that said, ﬁSorry, I don't take care of Jewish patients. ﬂ So she got frantically on to the phone and found an orthopedist in my grandfather's town, Boynton. He said, look, take a taxi, go to the backdoor of the Catholic orphanage. She gave the address. :Go into the freight entrance, I'll meet you at the orphanage. ﬂ He took a quick minute. He set my arm, put on a cast, and gave instructions to my pediatric doctor on what to do after the cast comes off. And basically she did that. My left arm now bends a little bit further than my right arms are, so she did a very good job. [Laughter] >> Bill Benson: But that's what it took for you to get your b roken arm stain care of. >> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. >> Bill Benson: So with your mother dealing with things like that, trying to close up the household, trying as humanly possible to save money to prepare to leave, that had to be just an incredibly stres sful time for her during those four months with your father gone. >> Frank Liebermann: It was. But, look, under the circumstances, you do what has to be done and the results were positive. I was blessed with very strong parents. >> Bill Benson: You're le aving for Breme rhaven , I believe, in 1938. >> Frank Liebermann: I have to interrupt. You have all heard of the Munich conference ? This was -- Hitler gave some demands on France and England. There was a conference between Prime Minister Chamberlain, the French, Prime Minister Daladier and Munich during which Hitler demanded the German -speaking part of land where the giant mountains on the German border and Chamberlain and Daladier gave into Hitler and basically gave away part of Czechoslovakia without their consent. Which was unbelievable at the time. Although we didn't know anything about this. Censorship was complete. There was no internet. T here was complete censorship of the press. You weren't allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts. By the way, during that time, Hitler called back all ships at sea with the threat of war. We took the train. We said goodbye to my grandparents. We went to Berlin to have our passport stamped with the day to make sure that we don't come back. It was instigated by the Swiss who wanted to make sure that they are not getting any Jewish refugees. It became necessary to do that to emigrate. We went on to Bremen. When we got to Bremen, there was no ship. Because the Europa, which was where we were booked, had been called back and was delayed for four days. Th is treaty happened in September, the beginning of September . A nd the trip took six days. The normal routine was that the ship stayed overnight, got cleaned, and took passengers the next day. So it always left on the same day . It made up three of the four days and finally it left with us a day late in order to get back to its regular schedule. Therefore, we knew nothing about this until we got to the ship and didn't find out about Munich until we were onboard and spoke to some Americans. Can't imagine total censorship but they had complete control of everything. >> Bill Benson: So you're finally -- the ship finally leaves and you make it to the United States. Tell us about arriving here, reuniting with your father, and then what happened. >> Frank Liebermann: My father picked us up. We stayed two days in New York. I got a sightseeing tour on the upper deck, the open deck, on a 5th Avenue bus which went all the way up 5th Avenue into Washington Heights and back. I got introdu ced to Coke. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: I thought it was cocoa. And I really didn't want it. [Laughter] And then we took the Empire State Express and went to Cleveland where my father had rented a one -bedroom apartment. I had the privilege of sleeping on a mercy bed , which is a bed which folds into a closet in the living room. We started a new life. 6 >> Bill Benson: Frank, your mother was able to bring some possessions. And one of the possessions that you brought, like the sewing machine, one was a bicycle. >> Frank Liebermann: That didn't come up until later. >> Bill Benson: Until later. Ok. I want to make sure we talk about that. >> Frank Liebermann: In other words, one of the treats I remember is on Thursday there was a local delicatessen on the bottom of the apartment house which had a 25 -cent special of a corned beef sandwich. And on Thursday we got a corned beef sandwich, a loaf of bread, and that was the family dinner. I started elementary school. At that time we didn't have TASSEL teach ers but I had a very nice Miss Emmanuel who stayed with me a little bit after class to help me catch up. >> Bill Benson: You started -- they put you back a grade. >> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. They put me in 3B. But when I got to Dayton, that was three months later, I got back into 4B so that I was -- >> Bill Benson: And then skipped ahead if I remember right. >> Frank Liebermann: I was caught up. >> Bill Benson: Frank, November 9, 10, 1938, you're home. Your parents are at the movies and you're home while they're at the movies. >> Frank Liebermann: Yeah. This was probably -- this was when I was here for three weeks, a little bit less. My parents decided they wanted to go to a movie. I think it was a Wednesday night special of 10 cents for a movie. Th ey asked a neighbor to look in on me. I didn't want a babysitter but she peeked in about every 15 minutes. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: All of a sudden around 9:00, the phone rang and it was a person -to-person phone call from my grandparents. I kn ew enough that it was the middle of the night for them, 3:00 in the morning. Now, person -to-person calls were for a specific person because phones -- phone calls were very expensive and you didn't want to miss anybody so it was about twice as much to call person -to-person. This was probably the longest hour of my life because I knew something was wrong and I didn't know what it was. When my parents came home, probably about 10:00, it was my grandparents that the business had been confiscated, that my mother's two twin brothers had been jailed, and that this was Kristallnacht. The synagogue at the time had been burned and they were desperate what can be done. My father took the next bus to New York to try to see Charlie, a person who gave the affidavit, who said he can't take any more responsibility even though we never took a penny from him. But apparently that was too close to the person whom his father had stolen from. We were in no position to make a guarantee and they tried desperately from that time o n to try to find some ways of getting out. Mainly for the children. My grandfather, who had since been widowed -- my grandmother died of natural causes -- was at an old age residence, assisted living. And the other grandparents also, they just wanted to save their children. We finally did manage to get passage to Shanghai. There were two countries which willingly took refugees. One was the Japanese -occupied Shanghai and the Dominican Republic, in the Caribbean. Otherwise the world was pretty much closed. They got tickets for Shanghai to leave June 1940. In the meantime World War II had started. This was just after the invasion, the breakthrough of the marginal line in France. Their ticket was on an Italian boat. After the Germans broke through and got to Paris, the Italians declared war on England and France. The Suez Canal was closed and the boat went back. That was the last word we got from my mother's brothers, one of the wives, and 3 -year -old cousin. >> Bill Benson: Maybe a grandparent, I can't remember, also was about to leave but I think -- >> Frank Liebermann: He got sick on a train. At least this is what we heard. >> Bill Benson: Right. >> Frank Liebermann: He had a ticket to get out through Spain but being sick he was transferred to Theresiensta dt where he died in 1940. We got this eventually through my grandparents who did write 7 occasionally, very heavily censored, letters, for instance. I remember one letter which was on file, from Theresienstadt, through the Red Cross, saying that we're doing fine, we've gained some weight. My grandfather now weighs 130 pounds. He used to weigh 180. So everything that could be said was coded. We finally found after World War II th rough from a rabbi who married my grandparents, Leo Beck. The Nazis somehow kept him alive in Theresienstadt, probably to keep a certain amount of order. My mother met him in Cincinnati at the Hebrew U nion College, I think in 1946 , and he confirmed that my grandparents were deported in 1943. And we got further indications that all the brothers died in Auschwitz. I'd like to say, I'm here as a witness. I am not a survivor. I had all the privileges of growing up here but I need to pass on what can happen to humanity. >> Bill Benson: In the time we have remaining, there's several more things I'd like you to share with us. Your father was -- once he was able to get his license, you moved to Dayton and he wanted to start a medical practice. Tell us what happened to him in Dayton, initially. >> Frank Liebermann: First of all, his fraternity brother, the gynecologist who persuaded him to come to Ohio, had shared an office with an ear, nose, throat physician. And he said it would really be a good idea for you to settle in Dayton, not in Cleveland. In order to save embarrassment and the fact t hat Dayton was growing, it was probably a very good choice. He opened his practice. We moved to Dayton. In the beginning of February , he opened his practice on Valentine's Day , and immediately asked for admittance to the medical society, which at that time was kind of a license to legitimacy, was expected for hospital privileges, etc. Shortly after he put in his application, the medical society in Dayton had an emergency meeting on a Friday night, which, by the way, is the first day of Shabbat, the evenin g of Shabbat. It was decided to require citizenship in order to qualify for membership in the medical society. And that was to take effect immediately. >> Bill Benson: They voted on it that Friday night. >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. Apparently there was some people who were quite upset with this. By the way, the vote was 52 -50. The next morning, a staff member of "The Dayton Herald," calle d my father's office and said, ﬁD octor, do you have time for me for about 15 minutes ?ﬂ He said sure. This was Saturday m orning. And he said, ﬁDoctor, I'd like to see your credentials. Where did you study? Where did you take your residency ? Give me your background. ﬂ He said , ﬁT hank you very much. I wanted to make sure that I knew as much about you as I could. ﬂ The next morning, the Sunday paper of "The Dayton Herald" had an editorial "Freedom of Opportunity in the United States." This was -- excuse me for making me cry. The next Monday he had 11 new patients. And we got established. And the rest of my life is pretty much history. >> Bill Benson: A couple more things, Frank. >> Frank Liebermann: Go ahead. >> Bill Benson: When you got to one of the items you brought with you was a bicycle from Germany. Please tell us about the bicycle. >> Frank Liebermann: I mentioned corruption. Friends of theirs had a bicycle and motorcycle shop. Mr. Horowitz. He said, We can put the bicycle into a box which takes less room for packing; I think it will make it much easier. I said thank you very much. And when we got to Dayton, we unpa cked the lift. We lived in a two -bedroom apartment. We unpacked some of the furniture and the bicycle. And shortly after that we got a letter saying, please be very careful when you unpack the bicycle. In the frame -- please take the bicycle apart. Take the seat off and go down in the frame. We had some gold pieces. Please keep those for us. They are quite valuable. And I have to give you background. Having gold coins was prohibited with a capital offense. My father was furious that they would endanger me and my mother for the sake of a few hundred dollars. We got those gold pieces. My father had five of them made, one for my mother, one for each of my kids. I think there was one extra. And they became little necklaces. Rather than selling them, I think the y finally wanted a refrigerator. He sent them a refrigerator and never wanted to hear from them 8 again. But People are desperate, they will do things. I always think of about a year ago, James Comey addressed an audience here. >> Bill Benson: The head of the FBI? >> Frank Liebermann: Yes. Who said that every FBI agent, every potential FBI agent, should have to come to this museum to see the abuse of power -- what the abuse of power can do. He redefined the word hu manity for me and for all of us: th at human ity shows our good side in what we can do as human beings but it also has a very dark side which we have to control. This is why I volunteer here. >> Bill Benson: Frank, we have time I think for a few quick questions from our audience. Can we do that ? Take a couple of quick questions? >> Frank Liebermann: Sure. >> Bill Benson: Before we close the program. We have a little more to go. Let's see if we have any questions from our audience. We have microphones coming down the aisle. Try to make your question as brief as you can. I'll repeat it to make sure everybody hears it and then Frank will respond to it. >> Mr. Liebermann , thank you for sharing your story. I'm curious how your parents spoke to you about what was going on in Germany and the world during the time you were grow up there and then ultimately why you were coming to the states. >> Bill Benso n: How did your parents speak to about what was going on and the decision to come to the United States ? What did they say to you? >> Frank Liebermann: A very good question, by the way. [Laughter] I knew what was going on. We heard the news. We didn't want to believe what was happening like most people didn't want to believe what was happening. I don't know how -- nobody really could fathom how corrupt the world became during this time. It just -- it wasn't feasible. In other words, civilization was at risk. I can never remember any time like this whether it was from the Japanese side, the German side. I don't know how to describe it. Unless you live thro ugh that, it's an era that I certainly would never, ever want to happen in any kind of way. And it's scary to think that so many people are acting in an uncivilized manner. >> Bill Benson: Thank you. We have another question. We have a young man right here, almost in the middle right there. Let the microphone come down to you. There you go. >> Did you hear any of Hitler's speeches or hear anything on the radio? >> Bill Benson: Did you hear any of Hitler's speeches or anything on the radio? >> Frank Lie bermann: You couldn't help hearing it. That's all you got. The enthusiasm is very difficult to even think about because a dictator can only be effective if he has support. >> Bill Benson: Thank you. We'll do one more question and then we're going to cl ose up. Ok. >> Mr. Liebermann, how were you treated as a child here, as a German immigrant ? I had friends that I taught with, Frank Mio moto, Japanese, he was sent to a concentration camp here in the United States. How were you treated? >> Bill Benson: Ho w were you treated when you came to the United States as a child, an immigrant from Germany? >> Frank Liebermann: I was treated very well. I never realized I had an accent. >> [Laughter] >> Frank Liebermann: In other words, I became Americanized and I became an American and a patriot from the day I stepped foot in New York. I lived the American dream. And I have my family to prove it. I have two daughters here, a son in Seattle, five grandchildren with whom I've traveled throughout the world and I wish the same for everybody. >> Bill Benson: We had a couple of other hands up. It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. I'm going to turn back to Frank in a moment to close the program. When he finishes, we invite anybody that wants to come up 9 on the stage afterwards, ask another question of Frank, just say hi, get your picture taken with him. So please know that you are very welcome to do that when we finish the program. I want to thank all of you. We'll have four more programs, two more weeks, this week before we close up for 2016. Our website will have information about our 2017 program. So please come back next year, even this year if you can do so. We'd love to have you. Frank, I'm going to turn to you for your last word but I'm going to interject one other note that we didn't get to talk about. You described to us your father on Kristallnacht, after getting the phone call from your grandparents, going to try to see what h e could do with the other family relative that was here in the United States. Your father went on to help bring out of Europe a lot of people and he was recognized for that later. Wasn't he? >> Frank Liebermann: My father gave out I think 107 affidavits for various refugees after World War II. >> Bill Benson: And that meant he took personal responsibility for them. >> Frank Liebermann: Correct. He was also head of the Jewish family service in Dayton, as a volunteer, not professionally. In fact, he was the recipient together with five people including President Truman of the 75th Anniversary HIAS Award for the settlement efforts. In other words, he did for others what he couldn't do for his own family. It's important to lift everybody that we can. This is one of the issues now. And I feel strongly about it. The better everybody lives, the better and safer we all are. >> Bill Benson: Thank you. >> [Applause]
