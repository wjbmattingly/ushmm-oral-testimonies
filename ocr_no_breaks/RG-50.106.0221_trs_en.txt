Q: Oh, my. A: 1942. Q: So, it ŠŠ A: Supposed to be unlucky. Q: Right. Right. A: So, because I was called on that day, when I went into service, I took 13 dollars and 13 cents with me. Q: I love it.

A: I went to the Army on February 13th, 1942, about a month and a half after Pearl Harbor. Q: And where were you stationed? A: Well, I was sent to Camp Croft, South Carolina, which was the infantry training center. And maybe I didn't speak up enou gh about what ŠŠ my background, because besides having a history background, I t ook one public administration course. Q: UmŠhum. A: And took the junior professional assi stance, that is a U.S. exam, in public administration and got a very high grade. Q: UmŠhum. A: I think I got a grade of 87. I hadn't been a member.

So, you'r e stationed in your first ŠŠ A: At Camp Croft, South Carolina. I was trained in the infantry. Q: Okay. All right. And then you stayed there ŠŠ A: And from there, at the end of training ŠŠ I think it was in June, it was a threeŠ month training period. Q: UmŠhum. A: February, March, April, May ŠŠ I think the beginning of June, a group of us, a train load of us, was sent to Camp Pendleton, Virginia. Q: Okay. A: Which is just south of Virginia Beach. Q: UmŠhum. A: And were assigned to the 111th Infantry. Q: UmŠhum. A: Which had been a Pennsylvania National Guard regiment. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And it was a combat team, stretched out along the coast. Q: UmŠhum. A: It's headQ:uarters were Fort Monroe. One battalion was at ŠŠ near Fort Story ŠŠ no. One battalion was at a camp called Camp Thalia, and later Camp Ashby, between Virginia and ŠŠ Virginia Beach and Norfolk. Q: UmŠhum. A: And this battalion was stretched out over the coast of Virginia. Another battalion was along the coast of North Carolina. And I was lucky, some of us were lucky who were from New York, and we were assigned to a battalion at a place called Westover, Maryland. That's ŠŠ you know, are you acQ: uainted with the with area Salisbury, Maryland? Q: A little bit, a little bit. A: Well, it's twenty miles below Salisbury, Maryland. Q: UmŠhum. A: And it was stretched ŠŠ there were three re giments, three infant ry companies. One company stayed at headQ:uarters at Westover. One was at Berlin, Maryland. Q: UmŠhum. A: And they protected the area around Ocean City and Chincoteague. Q: They were concerned about th e coast is what you're saying. A: Yeah. It was the Coast Defense Team on combat duty. Q: Oh, okay. A: We didn't combat, but we were armed to the tee, in case something happened along the coast. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And another company was at ŠŠ company was kept at ŠŠ at a place six miles above Cape Charles. Q: UmŠhum. A: Place called Oyster, Virginia. Q: So you ŠŠ but you stayed in your place for how long? A: I was at ŠŠ first, I was in the heavy weapons company. I was in the machine gun platoon, heavy machine gun platoon. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I was in it for about three or four months. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I asked the company commander, I said ŠŠ I said I'd like to go to headQ:uarters company, become a radioman. The reason I wanted to be a radioman, I figured it would give me more time to be free. Q: UmŠhum. A: To do reading. Q: UmŠhum. Okay. A: And he liked me very much, and he gave it to me. and then he was assigned to form a cannon company, and he wanted me to be his company clerk. Q: UmŠhum. A: In fact, while I was in the company, he looked at my record, and he had me give his orientation lectures that were historical, usually. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: But I went to headQ:uarters company, an d I was there for ŠŠ when I got there, they wanted me to be a scout. I said, "Look, I came here to be a radioman." So, I went to radio school. Q: Okay. A: At the first radio school I went to was mechanics radio school in Washington D.C. Q: Oh, okay. A: And that was three months. And it was really a good deal. Q: UmŠhum. A: Because some of the fellows went out to Kansas and some went to Altoona, Pennsylvania. And Washington D.C. was ea sy to get to New York on the railroad. Q: Right. Right. A: So, I was lucky there. Q: Then after that, what did you do? A: I came back to the comp any, and I was a radioman. Q: UmŠhum. A: I operated at headQ:uarters for a while, and then they sent me out to Oyster, Virginia, with two other fellows. Q: UmŠhum. A: To operate the radio in a command car. Q: UmŠhum. A: And that was a good deal because we were our own bosses. Q: Right. A: And we had a command car, and we drove around many times. We had free time. We had to charge the battery. And it was free ŠŠ we were our own bosses. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And then my regiment was alerted. An d they took some of us ŠŠ we had no choice in it ŠŠ sending ŠŠ some of us were ta ken and sent to Fort Monroe, to the Chesapeake Bay sector signal operations ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ unit. Q: UmŠhum. A: And from there, three of us went to the outfit that replaced the 111th Infantry, 101st Cavalry of New York. And it was at Camp Ashby, or Thalia, it's original name. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I did radio operating there ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ for a number of months, I think. Q: UmŠhum. A: From ŠŠ trying to think, I think for about three or four months. Q: Okay. A: And then, this group, three fellows ŠŠ another radioman and I and one wireman Š Š Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ suddenly got orders to repor t to Camp Ritchie, Maryland. Q: Okay. That's what I' d like to talk about now. A: We didn't know anything about Camp R itchie. We didn't know what it was. Q: UmŠhum. A: We were put on the night boat from ŠŠ from ŠŠ from Little Creek ŠŠ or rather, the night boat used to stop right near ŠŠ right at Fort Monroe, actually. Q: UmŠhum. A: The night boat from Norfolk to Baltimore. And we went ŠŠ took us a couple of days to get to Camp Ritchie. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And there, I was assigned to the radio platoon or ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ technical platoon of the 2nd Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company. Q: Okay. Had you heard of Camp Ritchie before? A: Never heard of Camp Ritchie before. Q: Okay. And who were the other soldiers you were with? A: In fact, one of the fellows was a fellow by the name of Rudy Brooks. Q: UmŠhum. A: He was a radioman. And another ŠŠ the other fellow, I think his name was Griffin. Q: So, some were Jewish and some were not? A: Those two weren't. Q: Were not. Okay. A: But there were Q:uite a few Jewish fellows in the company. Q: Were there any immigrants, any refugees from Germany? A: Oh, yeah. It was mainly made up of refugees from Germany. Q: Okay. And did you get ŠŠ A: We had the propaganda platoon, and th at was made up of the people mainly from Germany. Q: UmŠhum. A: Language people. Q: Yeah. Where German was their native language, you mean? A: Well, originally. Q: Yeah. Yeah. A: A number of them were refugees. For example, Steven Heym was there. Ever heard that name? Q: I don't think so. A: He ŠŠ there was ŠŠ before World War II or during it, there was a movie by the name of Escape, and he had written the book. Q: Oh, my. Oh, my. A: And after World War II, he wrote another book called Crusaders. Q: Okay. A: It's about the company. Q: Okay. Oh, okay. A: And unfortunately for him, after the war ende d, he went to the eastern zone of Berlin, maybe he was sympathetic with the new move ment. He thought it would bring wonders to Germany. Q: You're talking about communism. A: Yeah. And I understand that later on he had trouble with the dictatorial setup. Q: Yeah. A: And I think he may have committed suicide. Q: Oh, my. Oh, my. A: I'm not sure. Q: Yep. Yep. So, did you talk to any of the young refugees? Why you able to ŠŠ A: We spoke to them, yes. Q: Did they tell you ŠŠ did they ŠŠ A: Well, actually, many of them were hoi polloi. They looked down upon the technical people. Q: Oh, okay. A: The radiomen and the printers and all th at. We had ŠŠ in the technical platoon, we had a printing unit in the truck. We had re pair trucks. And then we had broadcasting trucks. Q: UmŠhum. A: Radio operated trucks. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. And so you didn't ŠŠ did you talk to them about what was happening in Germany and the re st of Europe to the Jews? A: Not really. I knew what was happening. We knew what was happening. Q: No, I know. But you did not talk this over. A: No. Q: Talk about it with ŠŠ A: No. Q: Yeah. Did you feel any connection to these Jewish refugees, any emotional connection? A: Some were very nice, and some thought they were in another world by themselves. Q: Yeah. Did they speak English well? A: Oh, yeah, they spok e English. Most of them spoke English well. There was one who spoke a number of languages, and fellows used to joke about him. Q: UmŠhum. A: He used to say, "I speak 11 languages, English the best." Q: Oh, my. Yeah. So, you're at Camp Ritchie with a mobile radio unit. And how long were you there for? A: We were there maybe ŠŠ not even a mont h when they divided the company. They took a group out of the company to form the 3rd Mobile Radio Broadcast. They were the cadre from 3rd Mobile Radio Broadcasting Comp any. I remained with 2nd. And we went up to Camp Sharp at Gettysburg. It's right on ŠŠ it was right on the battlefield. Q: Oh, my. Okay. A: In fact, Camp Sharp had originally been commanded, during World War I, by Eisenhower. Q: Oh, my. A: That's how he became acQ:uainted with Gettysburg. Q: Right. A: And after the war, you know, he moved to Gettysburg. Q: Yes, right. To a farm. Right. A: In fact, someone else interviewed me who was interested in it. Q: UmŠhum. A: Did you hear of Beverly Eddy? Q: No. A: My name was given to her. Q: Okay. A: And she interviewed me, too. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And I think she was a professor, I think of German. And she was at Dickinson College. Q: UmŠhum. A: And she's writing a book, I think, about Camp Sharp. Q: Oh, okay. So, now you're at Camp Sharp and s till doing your radio work. A: I was doing my radio work, and that was where we prepared to go overseas. Q: UmŠhum. A: And we weren't there very long, maybe a month, month and a half. Q: Are we talking about 1943? A: 1944. Q: 1944. A: This is 1944. Q: So, you were at Camp Ritchie, what ŠŠ what year? '44? A: In 1944, too. I went there February 19th, '44. Q: Okay. A: We maybe stayed at Ritchie for about three weeks. Q: UmŠhum. A: And then we went to Camp Sharp. Q: Camp Sharp. A: The 2nd Mobile. We used to call ŠŠ Camp Ritchie was very beautiful. Q: Was it? UmŠhum. A: It was very close to where the presidents go. Q: UmŠhum. A: You know, Camp David. Q: Camp David. Yeah. A: It was at one time called ShangriŠLa. Q: UmŠhum. A: Roosevelt used to go there. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And the mountains are beautiful right there. Q: UmŠhum.

A: I knew I was going to Europe, and from th ere we went to ŠŠ from Camp Sharp, we went back to Camp Ritchie. Q: Oh. A: To stay a few days. Q: Okay. A: And then we took the train from there to ŠŠ to Camp Shanks, wh ich is in, I think, Rockland County, New York. Q: Okay. A: There was a big camp, and that was the camp ŠŠ one of the camps from which they sent troops to Europe. Q: Okay. A: The other one being Camp Upton, in Long Island. Q: UmŠhum. A: Right. Q: So, you go on a troop ship. A: Yep. We went on the Queen Elizabeth. Q: The Queen Elizabeth? A: Yes. We went on ŠŠ I think we got on the ship that was March 30th ŠŠ how many days in March? Thirty or 31? Q: ThirtyŠone. A: Maybe March 30 or 31, I don't remember the date. Q: UmŠhum. A: We went down by train, from Camp Ritchi e, down along ŠŠ they had the west shore line of the New York central railroad at that time. Q: UmŠhum. A: To the docks in New Jersey and took a ferry across to the Queen Elizabeth. Q: Oh, my. A: They had to set up a ferry at the pier. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I think alongside, the other side of the pier, was the Normandy, that had been Š Š that had a fire or something. You've heard about that. Q: I've heard about the Normandy, yeah. A: And it ŠŠ it was on its side at the time. It was still ŠŠ I think still there when we were there. Q: Now, how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews in Europe by that ŠŠ by '44? A: Oh, we knew that. Q: By '44. A: I was always aware of that. Q: Yeah. Did your parents have contact with any family members who still were over? A: Right. In fact, I'm going to give you an article to read. The New York Times obituary of Monday, August 16th, 1943, has an obituary for my grandfather, and here's the headline: Abraham Pinkofsky dies at age of 104. One of 13 grandsons in war cited; three other lose lives. And it tells about, there were nine ŠŠ I think nine grandsons of his were in the American military service. Q: Oh, my. Oh, my. A: Of which, all of us came back. Q: Wonderful. A: None of us, I think, we re wounded. Three of them ŠŠ the paper only mentions the grandsons who were officers. One was Captain David Weiss (ph). At that time, my grandfather's death, he was a chief surgeon at Fort Totten, Queens. In fact, he told me that was the best year of his life, when he was there, because he had a beautiful home, right, at a beautiful area. It's a peninsul a on there ŠŠ where the East River joins the Long Island Sound. Another son had been an infantry captain, another grandson. And they took him out of the infantry, and he never went overseas. He was assigned to, I think, Camp Detrick, in Frederick, Maryland. Q: Fort Detrick. Fort Detrick. A: Yeah. It became Fort Detrick Q: Yeah. A: And the reason they took him out of the infantry was, he had a doctorate in bacteriology. Q: Yeah, right. Right. A: And he did research on biological warfare. In fact, I think he came down with anthrax himself. Q: Oh, my gosh. A: But he survived. They were working with the bug. Q: UmŠhum. Right. A: And another one, doesn't say where he was. Q: Where ŠŠ let's go back to your story now. So, you took the Queen Elizabeth over. A: Right. With 20,000 other men. Q: Twenty thousand. A: You couldn't imagine how crowded it was. Q: Yeah. And where did you land? A: We landed in ŠŠ I think it's called Gourock, the Port of Glasgow. Q: Okay. A: Is that correct? Q: I don't know. A: I don't know names. And we were welcomed ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ as we landed in the morning by a parade of a band of men in kilts playing bagpipes. Q: Okay. A: That was our greeting to Great Britain. Q: Okay. A: And as we paraded off, we march to the train and that took us to England. Q: Okay. A: And it was a full day trip down to a place ŠŠ I don't know what ŠŠ where they stopped, but I know wherever we stopped, I ha d gotten sick on the train. I got land sick. Q: UmŠhum. A: And the fellows helped me off onto a truck, and we went to a ca mp at a place called WottonŠunderŠEdge. Q: Okay. A: I don't think you've ever heard of it. Q: No. A: But a very famous man came from there. Wyecliffe. You ever hear of Wyecliffe? Q: Yeah, yeah. A: Wyecliffe translated the Bible to English. Q: Right. Into English, right. A: Right. Q: You're talking ab out April '44, right? A: April '44. Q: Okay. A: I think it took us about eight days to get there. Q: Okay. A: Now, the Queen Elizabeth normally would make England in about four days and five hours, but it took a wandering course. Q: Yes. I would imagine. A: Every trip was different. Q: UmŠhum. A: And the ship changed course every six minutes. But the last night, as we were approaching the coast of England, up at Sco tland, it was changing course every minute or two. Q: Oh, my. Oh, my. A: And people were falling out of the bunks. It was just keeling. Unbelievable. But they got us there safely. Q: Yes, right. Right. So, then you were in Wyecliffe. And then what? A: We were there maybe about a week, and we went to another town, at ŠŠ called Clevedon, on the coast. Q: UmŠhum. A: A beautiful town. And from there, you could see Wales. Q: And now this is still before DŠDay; right? A: This is before DŠDay. In fact, that's where we were preparing for DŠDay. Q: And how much did you know? A: We didn't know too much. Q: UmŠhum. A: But ŠŠ Q: And you are still doing your radio work? A: Oh, yes. But we didn't know too mu ch. We did our work, and that's all. Q: Okay. A: And then we went to ŠŠ from there, we'r e there maybe two or three weeks, we went to a place called Pittsfield, about 20 miles north of Bristol. Q: UmŠhum. Okay. A: And we were in a camp there with ŠŠ I think there was a ŠŠ a PX company that ran PXs, and also a camouflage engineer batta lion. And that's where we had our last preparation for the invasion. Q: UmŠhum. A: And one of the days just before the invasion ŠŠ in fact, maybe a couple weeks before the invasion, we would ŠŠ went tr aining on every weapon we had in the company. Q: UmŠhum. A: You fired every weapon. Machine guns and rifles and submachine guns and pistols. And suddenly, a c ouple of groups of men from my section were taken out. Q: UmŠhum. A: We didn't know where they went. Q: UmŠhum. A: And they ŠŠ and also one group th at went, went with the radio truck. Q: UmŠhum. A: On a twoŠandŠaŠhalfŠton truck. It was what ŠŠ a doghouse. I don't know if you've ever seen them. And it was a radio, a nd then these were groups that were landed. One of the groups in my section, we learned later, operated General Bradley's communication. Q: Oh, my. Were you in one of those groups? A: Well, I wasn't in that group. Q: No, I know. But ŠŠ A: They were ŠŠ came from my group. Q: UmŠhum. A: But we had no choice. They took some men, and they left. Q: Right. Right. So, what did you do then? A: So ŠŠ well, I remained in the company. Q: Right. And then? A: And those groups landed on, I think D Plus One. Q: Oh, okay. A: The second day. Q: Second day. Okay. A: The ones with the radios for ŠŠ Q: Right. A: ŠŠ General Bradley and also ŠŠ one truck reported war correspondents. Q: Oh. A: And they were ŠŠ that was ŠŠ the name of their radio station was Jig Easy Sugar Queen, JESQ. They reported, I think, from D Plus Two on. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I remained with another unit, which was a bigger broadcast unit than that one. Q: UmŠhum. A: Had ŠŠ it had two trailers. And I could dr ive a small truck. I had never driven a big truck. Before we landed, we were on a troop ship, and LST, Landing Ship, Tank. Q: This is D Plus One? A: No. This is ŠŠ actually, this is D Plus 20. Q: Oh. A: We were supposed to go in much before, but there was a big storm. Q: I see. So, this is three weeks after DŠDay? A: Twenty days. Q: Yeah. Okay. A: When the rest of the company went there. Q: Okay. A: And the company commander asked me to dr ive the trailer truck. And I said, "Look, I've never driven one of these. If you order me to, I'll try." Q: Yeah. A: But I didn't want to drive it because it ha d about six or seven forward speeds. And I had never driven one. I wouldn't be accustomed. It would be ridiculous ŠŠ Q: Right. A: ŠŠ to founder around and try to figure out what to do when you're landing at a beach. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: So, he had another fellow do it. Q: Okay. So, now you land on Normandy Beach? A: Right. And that day, we ŠŠ Q: Do you know which beach it was? A: Omaha. Q: It was Omaha. Oh, okay. A: There were still explosions on the beach taking place. Q: Oh, my. A: Mines. Q: Oh, my. Yeah. A: And we drove up the hill that they had to take. Q: UmŠhum. A: Which they took in the first day. Q: Right. A: The rangers took that. We drove up the hill and stayed overnight up on top of the hill. Q: UmŠhum. A: And then we went to a place called Colombieres. Q: UmŠhum. A: Colombieres is on the road to SainteŠMereŠEglise. Q: UmŠhum. Right. A: Have you ever been there? Q: Yes, yes. A: Have you ever heard of Colombieres? Q: I don't think so. A: CŠoŠlŠoŠmŠbŠiŠeŠrŠe (sic). That was where 1st Army headQ:uarters were. And we were at the Chateau De Colombieres, outside the town. Q: Okay. A: Our company was at the chateau. Most of the men lived in the field around it, and the officers lived in the chateau. Q: UmŠhum. A: And it had a moat around. It was an old chateau. Q: Yeah. A: And I operated a radio there. Q: Okay. A: I ŠŠ that time, I was with the transmitting section of the trailer. We had one transmitting ŠŠ one big trailer with a transmitter, oneŠkilowatt transmitter. Q: Did you have any mixing with the civilians or any refugees at that time? A: No. We didn't see any refugees. This was a French area. We saw French people. Q: Yeah. Yeah. A: And we spoke to them. Q: UmŠhum. A: And some of the fellows would go out and take a water can, and buy ŠŠ they would buy calvados from the farmers. Q: Right. A: Do you know what calvados is? Q: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A: But that stuff that they bought was liQ:uid fire. Q: I can imagine. A: It wasn't aged or anything. Q: Yeah. A: I tried it once, and I spat it right out. I never touched it again. Q: How long were you there? A: Well, we were there, maybe ŠŠ well, trying to think. Well, while we were there, I was grabbed to go to ammunition supplies goi ng to 128. And I always used to wonder, what does 128 mean? And I finally figured it out. It was the ammunition supply point one of the 28th Infantry Divi sion, which was in Normandy. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I was put in the ŠŠ they had me in a tent, to take care of the shells ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ that would be used for firing leaflets. Q: Oh, okay. A: Actually, they were shells with smoke canisters in them. They'd take out the smoke canister and put in a roll of leaflets. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I was right there in that ŠŠ they gave me a pyramidal tent to sleep in above the ground with a cot. And at night, the German planes would come over. We used to call them Bed Check Charlie. And I noticed, here I am, and if any bomb comes down close by, I'm right near the shells, I don't stand a chance. Q: Yeah. Right. Right. A: So, I noticed where the headquarters of the camp were. That was in another field. And the men had dug slit trenches, about three, four feet deep, and they have empty ammunition cases across the slit trench, and they cover the ammunition cases with the earth that they had shoveled up as a protection. Q: Right. A: So, after a few days being in the ŠŠ in the pyramidal tent, and sometimes fellows were drunk going past and shooting like wild, I said, "Eh, I am going to go dig myself a slit trench." Q: Right. A: Where the headquarters of the company is. Q: Right. A: That way, I'm not right next to the ammunition. Q: Right. A: And I was there maybe about a week. Q: UmŠhum. A: And then I went back to the company. Q: And from there, where did you go? A: From there, when we broke out of Normandy ŠŠ the day before we broke out, the planes were coming over in droves, without stopping, dropping bombs at the Germans in the SaintŠLo area. Q: UmŠhum. A: And they broke through Sa intŠLo. And I drove to SaintŠLo maybe the day after it was taken. Q: UmŠhum. A: And the fields were full of dead cows. Unbelievable. Q: UmŠhum. A: And in SaintŠLo ŠŠ there was a church in SaintŠLo. Q: Right. A: WellŠknown church. Q: Right. A: And right in the field in front of the church was a dead German. See, when an American was killed, his body was immediately removed. Q: Yeah. A: The Germans, they waited 'til they got enough Germans to collect them. Q: UmŠhum. A: Prisoners. In fact, when I was at that field where I was next to the shells, at the end of the field, there was dead German bodies all over the place that hadn't been picked up. And at night, I learned what the stench, smell of death is. Q: Oh, dear. Yeah. A: It permeated my clothes. It was horrible. But I wouldn't go near them. I saw them, and I never went there again. Q: Yeah. A: Some fellows came with a truck from my company, and there were looking for loot. And they went to the bodies, and they picked up things, you know, food and stuff like that. And then they were sick. Q: Yeah. Right. A: Stupid. Q: Yeah. A: But I was there. And then I went back to the company. Q: And then from SaintŠLo, where did you go? A: Then we went, my section, were ordered in to a place beyond ŠŠ in Brittany. Q: Okay. A: We drove past Rennes, which is the capital of Brittany, to a village called Thourie ŠŠ Thourie. And there there had been a tremendous radio station. Q: UmŠhum. A: 5,500Škilowatt station. And the building had been bombed by our planes. It was records. But still you could get up to the r oof. And there were bombs all around. And what the Germans didn't do to damage the transmitter, they did before we got there. Q: Yeah. A: But we had two ŠŠ civilian engineers, Mr. Morry Peace (ph), of CBS, and Mr. Darcy (ph), of BBC. Q: UmŠhum. A: They were working on repairing it, the transmitter. I understand they did get it fixed after a while. Q: UmŠhum. A: But I was sent ŠŠ then I was taken off the transmission group ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ and sent in the studio trailer, to Rennes, in Brittany, in the capital. And I was there for a number of weeks. Q: Okay. A: With a boy by the name ŠŠ fellow by the name of Dizzy Hemick (ph), who was a T52, but he was the best radioman in the company, and a FrenchŠspeaking fellow by the named of Jenot (ph). {coughing} Excuse me a minute. Q: Yep. A: And we took ŠŠ the studio unit had two tremendous record players. We had 26Š inchŠdiameter records at ŠŠ with music, French music, concert music, et cetera, that we played. And we broadcast different peop le, French people came in. And one of the men who broadcast from our unit was Genera l Koenig, who was the commander of the French Army's fighting. And one day, we se t up at the cathedral and church a broadcast for General de Gaulle. Q: UmŠhum. A: Koenig shook our hands; General de Gaulle didn't even acknowledge anything that we were doing work for him. Q: UmŠhum. You actually saw him? A: I was next to him. We set up the broadcast. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: He didn't even thank us. Q: UmŠhum. A: In fact, he was like the man below God, maybe even above God, who knows. Q: Right. A: And I was there for a number of weeks. Q: UmŠhum. And then where did you go? A: Then, Jenot and I ŠŠ in fact, we had a civilian with us who worked us with, two civilians, Sheftel, man by the name of Shefte l, who later became ŠŠ he was from a very wealthy family in New York, who became ŠŠ who Scholas tic Magazine. You ever hear of Scholastic? Q: Yes. Yes. A: And a Mr. Sullivan from BBC. And we did broadcasting there. Q: Where was this? A: From Rennes. Q: Oh, okay. You're still there. A: And we were hooked up through the transmitter ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: ŠŠ by wire. Q: UmŠhum. A: Where it went to the transmitter at Thourie and was broadcast. It was Radio Bretagne. Q: UmŠhum. A: I was there a number of weeks. And then Jenot and I were ordered back to the company. Q: UmŠhum. A: Which, at that time, Paris had no w been taken, had just been taken. Q: UmŠhum. A: It was at an old fort alongside the Versailles, across from Versailles, which I got to after the war. And we were there a little time, not too long, before we were sent out to Verdun, the battlefield. Q: Oh, my. UmŠhum. A: The old World War I battlefield. Q: Right. A: And when you drove through the country in that area, farm area, we used to say, you could tell the success of the farmer by the ŠŠ by the size of the manure pile in front of his house. Q: Right. Right. A: I don't know if you've ever been there. Q: Did you see any ŠŠ again, any refugees at all? Did you come across any of them? A: No, not at that time. Q: Not at that time. A: Not at that time. Q: Okay. So, moving along, where did you then go? A: From then, I was at Verdun for a while. Q: Okay. A: And then I was assigned to another unit with a twoŠandŠaŠhalfŠton truck and that radio broadcasting doghouse. Q: UmŠhum. A: The BB radio operator of that. And we we re sent to ŠŠ oh, I had another experience before that. I'll tell you. One time, while I was at Verdun, they wanted to send some leaflets to the 1st Army unit at the Spa in Belgium. And I was driving. So I drove a threeŠQuarterŠton truck with leaflets. And it was right close to the front. And I drove up, and at one point, I skidde d off the road. I think above Longwy, before a lawn, and I just took ŠŠ I had a winch on the truck, and I just put it around the tree, a tree, and pulled myself out, and got out to the road, and continued. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I went past Bastogne. Q: UmŠhum. A: And as I came to the top of the hill, s uddenly there was a mud slick on the load, and I spun around. And my truck landed up against a tree, but, fortunately, the spare tire, spare wheel, was on the driver's side, and my truck was disabled, but I was all right, and I got someone to ŠŠ a truck driver to pull me into Bastogne, this is before the Battle of Bastogne. And I went to a place, and I called up my company, and they came and got me in a day. Q: Yeah. A: But that was my experience there. After that, I was sent to the 9th Army with Lieutenant Balthour (ph), Raymond Wilson, and Mike Arob (ph). Mike Arob was the truck driver, the twoŠandŠaŠhalfŠton truck driver. And ŠŠ Q: And where did you go? A: We went to ŠŠ to ŠŠ to Maastricht. On the way Maastricht, it was uneventful until we got near Liege, maybe about 20 or so miles from Liege we saw light lighting up the entire sky. We didn't know what it was. We had heard what it was, but as we got to ŠŠ closer to Liege, which is a major crossroads in the city, we noticed something odd: Girls passing us wouldn't wave to us and wouldn't smil e. Well, we learned when we got to Liege what it was all about. We got into Liege and s uddenly buzz bombs, VŠ 1s, were dropping all around. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And we were looking for a bridge to get across in the River Meuse in Belgium, and in France, it's called the River Meuse. We finall y found a bridge to get across, and we went up to Maastricht, and that was it. Q: UmŠhum. A: And at Maastricht, for a number of days, we lived in the building where the reporters lived and the sensors lived. We slept in the halls, the enlisted men. And then they sent us up to ŠŠ up to ŠŠ on top of a hill, in the village called Bamalyn (ph), top of the hill, there was a hotel, and I think the 4th Mobile Radio Broadcasting Company was there. And we operated a transmitter. The reporters would come up from ŠŠ Q: And, again, you didn't see any refugees yet. A: No, we didn't see any refugees, not there. Q: And then from there, where did you go? A: We didn't see refugees until we went into Germany. Q: Let's get to that then. A: After crossing into Germany, we saw refugees all around. Q: Okay. A: I remember one city we were in, the last town we were in before we got to Die Alb, where we stopped, this place, people were breaking into stores, and the German people stopped us. Police started to beat them up, and we stopped them. Q: UmŠhum. A: We stopped them. And that was about it. Q: Did you talk to any of the refugees? A: Not really. Didn't have a chance. Q: UmŠhum. Yeah. And so, then, where were you in Germany? A: In Germany? Q: Yes. A: At first ŠŠ well, we were near Die Alb for quite a while. Q: Right, umŠhum. A: And then we were ordered, my unit, the broadcasting unit, we were ordered to Bremen, and there we broadcast reporters from Bremen. The war was over by then. The war ended on May 8th. Q: So, this is after May 8th? A: Yeah. Q: And had you gone by any camps? Had yo u gone past any camps when you were ŠŠ A: Well, I had an opportunity to go to Bergen Belsen, and I didn't want to see it. Q: Because? A: I didn't want to see the ugliness. Q: Okay. But you were, by that time, well aware of what had happened. A: I was well aware what happened. Q: To the Jews and others. Yeah. UmŠhum. A: And that was it. Q: UmŠhum. A: Basically, until ŠŠ let me see ŠŠ oh, when I was in the ŠŠ something else. When I was in Rennes, we had a fellow, another man working with us, a language man, Irving Barrinson (ph). And he ŠŠ we went with him once to a Dr. Loucarlay (ph), in the village of Quintin, QŠuŠiŠnŠtŠiŠn. Irving Barrinson had been a teacher in New York, French teacher, and before the war, he had studied at the Le Se (ph). And he knew the son of this Dr. Loucarlay, and he wanted to visit him. Q: UmŠhum. A: And we visited him, Dr. Lo ucarlay, we visited. And Dr. Loucarlay's son had been taken by the Germans. He didn't know wh at had happened to him exactly. No one knew. And we went ŠŠ and this trip, too, we were invited to a liberation banQ:uet for Brittany. And it was the biggest meal I ever had. Q: What was your feeling when you heard the war was over? A: Oh, well, I knew it was over, ending as we moved across. Q: But, emotionally, what were your thoughts? A: I was very happy. I was interviewed twice. Once by Lieutenant Fuller ŠŠ I think he later became an officer in my company ŠŠ on a wire recorder, and the second time, after the war was ended, by Bill Downs. Q: UmŠhum. A: Of CBS. Q: Right. A: He wanted to get ŠŠ I was the GI that he chose to interview. Q: Because were you Jewish? A: No. Because of the ŠŠ they wanted to interview me on the US, on the end of the war. Q: Oh. A: Nothing because I was Jewish. Q: Okay. Okay. A: And that's it. Q: So, then you stayed in Europe for how long? A: I stayed in Europe ŠŠ well, after we were in Bremen maybe two or three weeks, and we were ordered to company to the headQ:uarter at Wiesbaden. And then, at Wiesbaden, I did notice one thing that was Jewish. I used to go ŠŠ to where I used to go to get a bath, a bath house, attached to a Jewish cemetery, the Jewish cemetery of Wiesbaden. And there were signs in it forbidding anyone from entering it. Q: UmŠhum. A: Put up by the Army. But I didn't see any Jewish people there. Q: UmŠhum. Did you talk to any Jewish refugees at all while you were there? A: No, not really. Q: Not really. Okay. And so then you came back to the United States when? A: I came back to the Un ited States in November. Q: Of '45. A: Of '45. Q: Okay. And before I ask you some questions about your thoughts, just tell me, when you came back, you went back to school, and then ŠŠ A: Well, I got a job teaching almost immediately. Q: Okay. And then? A: And I also went back to school to get my degree. Q: UmŠhum. A: I wrote up my master's paper. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I met my wife, and we married. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And I had all the courses for a Ph.D. In fact, the head of the depa rtment of history of Columbia University spoke to me, he says, "Phil, you ha ve to take a year off from work and knock out your Ph.D." Q: UmŠhum. A: In fact, I had had him as a teacher at City College. Q: UmŠhum. A: From City College, he went to Columbia. And he was head of the department. And I couldn't do it. Q: UmŠhum. A: Because I didn't have the time, and I had children. Q: Yeah. Right. Right. Can we now talk a little bit about what your thoughts are? First of all, how you feel about Germany today? A: You mean today? Q: Yeah. A: I wouldn't go back to Germany, when I went to Europe of number of times since the war, because of what they had been done to the Jews. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And, now, I'm rather sorry that I didn't go back. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. Because? A: Well, you know, there is a Jewish community in Germany again. Q: Right. A: And I felt I want to go back to see it. I've read about it. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: And, in fact, I have a record, one of my famous best CDs is ŠŠ was made in Germany, Jewish music. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I would have liked to have seen it again. Q: UmŠhum. A: I had an easy life when I was in Germany. I was in Germany from ŠŠ maybe six months after the war. Q: UmŠhum. A: But I didn't associate with Germans. I ŠŠ but it was a very easy life. Q: But ŠŠ and post war, did you talk to any refugees, any Jewish refugees, any ŠŠ post war, while ŠŠ in the six months ŠŠ during those six months after the war? A: No. Q: You did not. A: I didn't see them. Q: You didn't see them. Okay . Okay. Do you think the Ho locaust could happen again? A: I hope not. What else? There were some people who would gl adly happen with the Holocaust. Q: Yeah. Yeah. A: They're still here in this world. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. When you were teaching ŠŠ and you stayed in teaching right, for your professional life? A: Right. Q: Did you talk about your experiences as a soldier? Did you bring that into your classes? A: Not too often. Q: UmŠhum. UmŠhum. A: There was no reason to bring it in. Q: I see. A: Once I mentioned the ŠŠ I mentioned ŠŠ I would mention the Holocaust in teaching. Q: Yeah. Yeah. So, were you a history teacher, high school history teacher? A: Right. Yeah. Q: Were you active in the civil rights moveme nts? Considering people were deprived of their civil rights during the '30s and the '40s. A: Well, I was for it. But, you know, I protested the Vietnam war, and I supported ending it. I thought it was ridiculous. Q: UmŠhum. A: And I went to a meeting that students held. Q: UmŠhum. A: In Hicksville, behind a big shopping center, and when I h eard them talk, I ŠŠ I said they were crazy. They want to make a revolution. They didn't realize that ŠŠ it was idiotic the way some of them were talking. Q: These were people antiŠVietnam War? A: Not only that, I saw some of the kids, too, who were antiŠVietnam in high school. Q: UmŠhum. A: If they were in a club and talking with a group of kids, they wouldn't have let anyone talk who was ŠŠ didn't agree with them. Q: Yeah, right. A: And, that, I opposed. Q: Right. Have you been to Israel? A: Yes. I was there about ten days. It was wonderful. In fact, I cried. When we were with a group, we went to the cemetery where we ŠŠ the one leading the group asked me to lead a ?sieska?. And I cried there. Q: Aww. Yeah. Yeah. This is a cemetery in Jerusalem, you're saying? A: In Jerusalem, the main cemetery, where they had the memorials. Q: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Knowing what you did ŠŠ what you do now know about what happened to the Jews during this time, '33 to '45, did it make you more religious, less religious or ŠŠ A: It doesn't make me more religious. Q: Or less ŠŠ A: You know, you can be ŠŠ I'm not over ly religious. I may go to services occasionally, but ŠŠ I belong to the temple, but ŠŠ Q: UmŠhum. A: I'm not finically religious. Q: So, it didn't affect your religious outlook. A: Yeah. Q: Going through ŠŠ yeah. So, do you th ink the world has learned any lessons? A: Does it look it? Q: Yeah. Well, is there anything else you wanted to add ŠŠ A: No. Q: ŠŠ that we hadn't talked about your experiences during the war? Anything else? A: No. Q: Okay. All right. And so, I will conclude my by just saying a few words. A: You interviewed Captain Jaffey (ph), didn't you? Q: Not yet, not yet. Next week. Next week. I will. A: You know he went to Israel after the war. Q: Oh, okay. I'll ask him about that. I'll ask him about that. But I'm going to conclude this by just saying a few words. Okay? Unle ss there's something else that you wanted to say. Nothing else? A: Well, I was going to say, if you could ju st interview my sonŠinŠlaw, if he'd be willing to be interviewed, he might have some very interesting things to say. Q: We can talk about that later. We can ta lk about that later. Okay. Well thank you, again, for doing the interview, and I will just conclude by saying, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Philip Pines. Conclusion of Interview
