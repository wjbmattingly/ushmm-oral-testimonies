So I sat down and that minute when I sit down, door open, and the police Œ that wa s a soldier, and he saw something moving in bed, right away pointed the gun with bayonet at me. And from that time, he was after me. Then I wanted to go to washroom. I ha-had to go outsid e. So he follow me. And halfway I turn around to see, and he was there walking with the gun after me.

Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 21Then the only thing what I did, try to save my pictures that I have f-few pi-pictures in envelope of myself from school an-and that.

Q: And then the second day, as you™re taken to the train station Œ A: Yes. Q: Œ your sled tips over. And why did it tip over? Was the driver driving too fast? A: Or maybe the hole was the in ground, and that™s covered up with snow. That could be the reason, you know. A2: It was a turn. A: Yeah, or turn, okay. But something like that, that if he would be careful, it wouldn™t Œ Q: It wouldn™t have happened.

A: Okay, so the next day, get back on th e sled, keep going. Going there, I could ride. Q: Mm-hm, on the sled. A: And I think my sister could ride, I don™ t remember if she a ll the time she could ride. And when we came to Œ few times we stay for the night, you know. Then when we came to our camp Teshuava(ph), then, like my sister told you, with those barracks, they had four a nd four Œ you know, one entr ance on each side, and they had four rooms in each. And on the end th ey had barrack with Œ if somebody Œ if they would arrest, they will put you there, in that barrack. And like if the mother would Œ wouldn™t want you Œ send the child to school, Russian school, then she will be arrested and put there. Q: I see. Were there a lot of people who were Œ Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 32A: I Œ that I don™t know. Q: Œ kept in those barracks? A: That I don™t know, but the Œ we were told that™s what Œ and that Œ that guy that came, bra Œ brought Œ drove the taxi to came to pick da Œ my dad up, you know, to Œ he lived someplace in that area. Q: So when he Œ was he on another transport? A: That I don™t Œ I don™t know if they Œ he came on the same transport. Probably. Prob Œ but not in our car, not Œ you know. It could be in the same transport, you know, because I think just one transport they brought Œ Q: Everybody. A: Œ right there, you know, to our camp. Q: Uh-huh. So he™s the one who had come to first arrest your father, or Œ or did he arrive to second arrest your father, the second time Œ A: Second Œ wait Œ Q: Second time. A: Œ second time, because the first time I do Œ he went to the village Œ Q: Right. A: Œ get my dad, so I don™t know what happened. Q: And that was January fifth, and a month later, he himself gets deported Œ Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 33A: Yes. Q: Œ along with that Œ those neighbors of yours. A: Wait a minute. What do you mean Œ Q: Well, his aunt Œ he had an aunt who was your neighbor. A: No, no, not the aunt, no, sh e wasn™t our aunt, his aunt Œ Q: That™s right. Was she deported too? A: No. Q: Oh, okay. A: No, they stayed. Q: They stayed, but he himself was deported. Okay. A: That Œ but he lived with her in the village Œ I don™t know Markhelowsta (ph) or something, with hi Œ whi Œ he was rais ed there, and his parents were there. Q: So the Œ A: So he didn™t live with the aunt in Poland. Q: You didn™t know why he was deported, or did you? No. A: No. Q: Did you have any contact with him while you were in Tushela(ph) Œ Tushelova(ph) or something? A: Oh, I have to tell you that. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 34Q: Yeah? A: They had the big family, he was the bi ggest one and I Œ nobody think that he was a son of that family. And every day I would sit by that little table by the window, just little table like Œ like this, from this to this, and watch people coming from the store. He was the only one, many times he would go for the bread. He was the only one bringing big loaf of white bread. An d Œ and Œ and Œ and besides that lo Œ big white bread, because that™s well baked so you Œ you get more, and I think some of that black, but Œ Q: You™d have a Œ A: Œ and I was always sitting and dreaming, oh, if I could have that piece of bread. And my Œ one time my Œ my mom send my si ster for bread and she says, ask them if they could give white bread so she co uld give to baby. And she came back, she says no, they wo Œ they didn™t gave. He sa ys, we don™t have. But that family always could get, every day. Q: Isn™t that interesting. A: Yeah, that™s Œ and I never forgot that, because I Œ you dream ya Œ how much food you had in Poland. So when you are starving, y ou always have that in mind. You see that big table with food, full of food. Q: And why do you think he wa s able to get this bread? Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 35A: No idea. But I make sure that I will be in that window watching him, and thinking how must been really ta Œ good to have piece of bread like that. So that™s all what I know. Q: Did he ever speak to you, or you spoke to him? A: No, no. He wa Œ I was kid, and he was grown-up, I d on™t know how old he was, maybe more than 20, huh? Q: Yeah. A: No idea, but well-built, tall and well-built, you know. That™s a Œ Q: Okay. Hang on Œ hang on ju st a second. I know that you are sitting there in the background, Mrs. Stanisawa , is this a gentleman Œ did he belong to that family that informed on other people? A2: He was as Œ just related. Q: He was related to them. A2: But Œ but he came all the way here because he was the one of the people that was telling on other Polish mee tings, and whatever. And so his Œ his treatment of the family was by Œ as a reward for Œ for that. Q: Okay, so what Œ what your sister said is Œ in her testimony she said that there was one family who got bette r treatment because they would inform on others. And I asked whether this man who had been involv ed in the arrest of your father, was in Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 36any way part of this family. And she said yes, he is related to them, and he got better treatment because he informed on what other people were doing. Have I got that right? A2: Right. Q: Yeah, okay. Thank you. Do you remember his name? A: His name, no. But that other name Œ A2: [indecipherable] A: That other name of family, the boy was going with me to school in Mexico . Q: Really? A: He was with parents Œ oh, I think ho Œ he had both parents, I think, and I was in orphanage, but in school they kept togeth er. Was very nice boy that Œ my age right away, too. So that [indecipherable] you know, what have you, was really nice. Q: And so you remembered this. What was Œ what else do you remember about when you first arrived, and saw those barr acks, and saw where you would be living? Can you tell us, you know, what that looked like? A: Well, it was a cold place, that™s one thing, because when we came in there™s no fire, no nothing. So the on Œ I remember everything what was there. The bed, made from boards, bigger bed on one side, and one on that, and that little table with two Œ I don™t know, benches Œ Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 37Q: Stools? A: Stools, I think, on both sides Œ no, i Œ okay, but ther Œ Q: Stools. A: Œ for one person. And that stove was in that corner, and I think, like my sister says, that was Œ on our side, in that corner was that metal bed where my da Œ brother, when he came, would come when he had rheumatoid arthritis, he would hang to that bed, you know, from the pain, you know. And you could hear that movement he was making with that bed, fro m the pain, you know. So that Œ that™s Œ you know Œ Q: That™s what you remember. A: Yeah, oh yeah. Q: Yeah. Do you remember, did anybody come and tell you why you were there Œ A: Mm-mm. Q: Œ why you had been arrested? A: No, not here, but in Poland we knew, because my dad was taking part in World War I fighting, and I think my Œ when th ey were collecting like gold or something for the country, then my dad and Œ gave his, and my mom™s wedding band, donated. And so that, for that, I think that™s what they put Œ Q: As the reason? Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 38A: Œ in his rec-record Œ record, you know. That I remember, because that™s what Dad was to Œ telling, you know. Q: I see. So when he was released from the first arrest, he said that Œ that one of the reasons he was arrested was because of that, because of se Œ you know, his giving some things to support the Polish army. A: Yeah, yeah. And they kept records so well, because they knew what he Œ what he did in the life that he Œ they knew th at he had a gun, a rifle or something, but they took already that one, before the end, you know. Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember when they took the gun? Were you in the house? A: That I don™t remember vividly, when th ey came for that, but I know that they did, because my parents were mentioning that, you know, few times. Q: Okay. And now we™ve just digr essed to talk about back in Poland, you know, before that Œ you were deported. So let™s go back to this area. Where Œ what did the forest look like? Were you in the middle of a forest? A: No. The forest, one piece was on the side, on one side of our settle Œ Q: Your settle Œ your camp. A: [indecipherable] camp, the houses, because we have house. We had three Œ three or four buildings besides that, you kno w. And so that was farther there. Then one far, far away there, in that direction, and then fields, and then on the other side. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 39Q: So the forests were not close in Œ A: No. Q: Œ they were further away. A: Yeah, but this one was the closest because it fr Œ I thi nk when they were building their house, then they were cutting that Œ Q: Forest. A: Œ forest by the house there. And you could see it there. Q: And what kind of trees were they, were they Œ A: Wait a minute, how you call them? Pines, yeah, pines Œ Q: Pines. A: Œ a lot. Q: Pine tree, okay. A: Yeah, na Œ a lot. But in one section of the forest, on that side, they had, I think, brzozowy in Poland Œ Polish, quite Œ A2: Birch. A: Birch. Q: Got it. A: And the only place that the mushrooms grew is in that Œ Q: Oh. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 40A: Œ and that™s where we used to like to go. Q: Mushroom picking. A: Yeah. And this one had a little blueberries, you know, and strawberries, wild, on the outskirts of Œ Q: On the outskirts. A: So Œ so we were lucky, you know. Q: Yeah. So Œ so the settlement, it sounds like this camp area was in a Œ in an open place, surrounded Œ A: Wait, you are talking about Poland , right? Q: No, I was talking Œ A: Oh, wait a minute, I was talking about Poland . Q: You were talking about your land in Poland? A: Yes. Q: Oh, no, no, no, no, that™s your home in Poland you were talking about. A: Yeah, yes. Q: No, I™m talking about where you were deported to. A: Oh, okay. So, when we were driving, I think, with the train, and with this sled, what you saw, trees, trees, trees. When they came, that™s why they could transport Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 41people in the winter when is everything frozen, because in the area we were, it was swamps, lakes, trees. Q: Okay. A: So that Œ otherwise, in the summer, you cannot escape from there. And then Œ Q: Why? A: Because Œ Q: Are you surrounded by water? A: Swamps. Q: Okay. A: And water, and trees, you know. There™s no end of the woods. And when they ke Œ brought us to camp Teshuava(ph), that used to be trees, but they cut that out for Œ to make the camp. So that™s Œ on one side is the lake, big lake, I think 26 kilometers long, and four or six ki Œ Q: Wide? A: Œ wide, yeah. So here we have la ke, and then, surrounded by Œ by woods. But little distance, you know, for the camp f Œ we had f-for buildings. And that way is north, or what have you. Then hi Œ there was a hill, and there was a cemetery. And to the left, there was a field for them, that guy that was in charge of camp. So he grew there Œ I know one Œ tomat Œ potatoes he was grow, because one time, after Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 42they already collected th-the g Œ potatoes, harvest the potatoes, then I went, toward the evening, to cemetery. And then next to was the field, and I thought, maybe I will find something. So I was looking. I don™t remember if I found any piece of potato. But then, when I stood there on that hill on cemetery and looked down, I felt like I am bird in the cage. Q: Really? A: Just see the opening this, and then all woods. So that™s Œ that never Œ I never forgot that, you know. Q: So you felt Œ you were on the top of a hill. A: Yeah, that™s cemetery was higher up. It wasn™t real tall, but it was a hill, you know. Q: Was it a large cemetery? A: Oh, pretty Œ pretty nice size, but how many? Tha Œ I don™t know. Q: Okay. A: And what Œ all else you could Œ under trees, when you walking Œ walk in that trees Œ woods, on some trees you ha Œ you could see they carved names. And also, in our room, under the table, when you go underneath, you see some names carved in, so that people, they were before us there. Q: Yeah. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 43A: But on the trees, some of them, they had too. Q: They also had their names. A: Yeah, yeah. So we weren™t the first ones to be sended there and die in that place, you know. Q: What was the camp manager like? A: Well, I Œ I don™t know, but apparently he must be not too bad if he gave my mom a glass of milk for baby, because he couldn™t give you much, because if he had one cow, you know? Q: And he did that one time, huh? A: I don™t know how many times, but my sister was saying that, you know. Q: He gave a glass of milk. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: So he must be not bad, you know. Q: Your brother Œ your older brother, tell me Œ tell me what he looked like when he went out to work, and when he came back. A: Okay, so next day they had to go, and they told him to pack, and you have to leave tomorrow with a-adults. And they took them about, I don™t know, I don™t Œ that stuck in my head somehow, 30 kilme Œ kilometers deep in the woods, where Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 44they had to cut the trees, and then bring that to the shores, when the lake was Œ or river was frozen. That™s what Œ whole winter they were doing that. And Œ Q: Was there a camp kitchen? Was there like a cafeteria? A: They had u Œ they had kitchen that they had big, big, big that kettle, and they make soup, using dry fish a nd some noodles, but Œ but when you got that soup, you were lucky if you had one or two noodles. You got mo re worms floating on that, because from dry fish, you know, they spoil, and the worms take over. So that™s Œ and one scoop, you know, like soup scoop Œ Q: Did you Œ A: Œ you get. Q: Mm-hm. Was Œ A: And then 40 grams of bread if you had money to buy, for each child or person, that they didn™t [indecipherable] Q: So you had Œ you had a ration, but you had to also pay for this ration. A: Yes, yes. That™s why we try to help my mom. We™d go after school and cut wood to Œ to get some money, or go for cr anberry Œ picking cran berry in the Œ deep in the woods, to sell, so we will get few ca Œ cents, you know, for that. Yeah. And then we had to Œ we wanted to help my mom, so we w ould go, two of us, take the sled, take the saw that™s for two people, and cut the tr-tree down, and then cut in Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 45pieces, put on the sled and drag, because it was maybe half hou Œ half mile, or Œ or more, yeah. And that™s Œ you see that in the summer, the swamps , so they put the big logs where you are walking. In the wi nter that™s frozen, so you could walk through Œ Q: You could walk on that, yeah. A: Œ on that, you know, that help. But we dr ag that in. But my mom says, I told you don™t cut so big trees. It take Œ you know Œ but we wanted to do the best we could. And we knew how to cut because then, when tree was falling, when we found out and we™d [indecipherable] and we will shout, you know, some expression we had, and run to Œ Q: Run to that place, yeah. A: So, you know, but Œ Q: Tell me about your brother, your little brother. A: Oh, that Œ you see, when he die on the Œ the last minutes, I was in the room, and my mom Œ he was crying. He had wounds on the neck, and she said, hold his hand, so she wanted to get something. And I™m holding the hand, and he jerk, and start scratching, and that start bleeding. And when I saw that, I faint. And poor mother, I know that she pick me up, put me on the be d, and took care of the baby. But I don™t Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 46know if that was on that day that he die, or next day, but that ™s what Œ I have bad memory of that. Q: Was he very Œ had Œ did he Œ did he Œ had he lost Œ did he have any meat on him, was he skin and bones, was he starving? A: Oh, he was starving, for sure, because when my mom had leftover honey cake from Poland , when she finished that, the bread she couldn™t give him, because that was too hard for his stomach. So I don™t know what she was giving him, but not what he needed. And that™s why my mom sent my sister to the store, to ask for white bread if they could give at least one pe Œ little piece of it, you know, but he says no, we don™t have. But he had for Œ Q: Somebody Œ A: Œ for them. Q: Yeah. A: For them he always had. So I guess that™s, you know, what life Œ Q: That was very bitter. A: Yeah, uh-huh. Q: And do you remember how you buried your brother? A: Yes. Q: Tell me about it. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 47A: They had Œ I don™t know who put toge ther the Œ from the boards, the box, you know. I say box because, you know. And the Œ a little girl died at this same time, so they put two together in the one coffin. Q: In one bo Œ coffin? A: Yeah, she in one side the head, and my baby brother Œ A2: No, there were two coffins, there was not Œ A: I don™t Œ I s Œ A2: The [indecipherable] was only one. A: I reme Œ oh, I don™t know, but I saw them two laying there. Because that™s winter, very Œ A2: They were in a grave, but not Œ A: In the grave though, we had the one . So I don™t know, maybe, you know Œ Q: Your sister is saying that he had his own little coffin Œ A2: Yeah [indecipherable] A: Oh, okay. Q: And that she had her coffin. A: Okay. Q: Okay. A: But I had something in the head like this, so that™s a Œ Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 48Q: Tha-That there were two of them. A: But then we went and Œ ev ery day went to take care of the grave, and we really loved him, and t-took him fo r walks, and it was Œ and that™s what my mom said, wouldn™t be for him, she wouldn™t survive. Q: Really? A: Yeah, he was keeping her Œ because she knew that without her, he wouldn™t survive too, you know. Q: Yeah, yeah. So what happened with her later? A: My mom? Q: Mm-hm. A: Oh, like when we were in Vologda Œ Q: No, no, I meant, not in Vologda , but I mean, after he died. A: Oh. Oh, she was very sad, but the life had to go on. Oh yeah, one time Œ I don™t know, was there two policemen, or what, two military guys, or what. Two Œ I think two of them came, and they were going through Œ all around, and looking for children to take to orphanage, especially the ones that the mothers couldn™t work. And they came, and they wanted to take my sister and me. And they didn™t Œ babies they wouldn™t take. And we begged my mo m Œ they needed her permission, so we cry and beg. So he says, I will come to ward the evening, and see what, you know, Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 49my mom will Œ what decision she will make. So whole day we just hang around her and begging not to give us. And when they came, she says no, I won™t give them, you take this baby. And they said no, we ca Œ we Œ we want those older ones. And they left. So we stay with our mom. So that second time that I almost lost Œ separated in Poland, and now second time. Q: Right, right, from her. A: Yeah. Q: And it was Œ and they wanted Œ th-they Œ was it that they wanted that she be for Œ be able to go to work? A: No, because she couldn™t work. So this way they knew that she has hardship. A2: They would kill her. A: Yeah. Q: Yeah. A: So that™s Œ I think that™s the reason. Q: Wait, I Œ I don™t understand, that she had ha Œ they wanted to take you, so that Œ A: She will have easier. Q: So that she would have it easier? A: Yeah, I guess. A2: No. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 50A: No? Well, you can ask her. Q: Your sister is saying no. Sh e thinks Œ what do you think? A2: I think they would take her and Œ and destroy her. Q: Your sister is thinking Œ A: I don™t know. Q: Œ that they Œ if they took you two, then they would have been able to take her out and Œ and shoot her or destroy her in some way. A: That I don™t know. Q: Yeah, but you know Œ yeah, it sounds like in both ca ses, it™s supposition. You don™t know really why Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ why they Œ A: Yeah. Q: Œ were doing this, or wanted to do this. A2: They would do the sa me what they did with the old people there. Q: I see, I see. Now, did you go to school in this camp? A: Yes. Q: Tell me a little about that. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 51A: Well, we had two in Russian, and they were pretty good teachers because they would teach us how to write so nicely from one line to the other, the letters had to be. And math was good too, and like they were teaching the Œ that no Œ there is no God, we had in my class from the same thing. Now when the teacher would go and do inspection about each child, and when we Œ I had the medal, I would put underneath chair™s leg, to hide it. So this way Œ otherwise, he would take away from me. Q: Oh, you mean a religious medal? A: Yeah, oh yeah. And Œ but Œ and then we had to learn a lot of poems, Russian poems, everything Russian. And one time, I was going to school in the morning, was very, very windy, and that gate was loose, had loose boards, and the wind blew, and that big nail, rusted nail went with Œ in my knee here Œ Q: In your leg. A: Œ in the bone, all the way to bone. So my mom kept me at home, because I was getting infection, and Œ and one time teacher came to check on me if I am really sick, because otherwise she would lock hi Œ her in that last Œ Q: That jail room. A: Yeah. And she had to open up, and then show him that Œ Q: That you™re really sick. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 52A: Yeah, and with chamomile, she ra Œ she Œ she managed to heal that. But I had to lay all the time in. But that was the only mirac Œ thing that she could have. Q: That she could think of, yeah. A: Yeah, and that we found Œ well, maybe from Poland we had some, you know. Q: Okay, so tell me about how you le arned that you could leave the camp. A: Amnesty came. Amnesty, in July 30, 1941. Q: Did you hear about it soon, the Œ in Œ on July 3rd, or it Œ that™s when it was given in the United States? A: I don™t know how we heard, but we heard, and then that™s why the man from deep, from the woods there, that my brother Œ where wa s my broth Œ they were coming because they say th-they don™t have any jobs for them. So ev-everybody at ki Œ in the camp didn™t Œ lost their jobs. Q: Okay. A: And people didn™t had money, they run out of what they have money. So that™s why, you know Œ and then in Œ when they Œ my brother heard about the Polish army forming, you know, then, like she told you about the few, those boys in his age, and older men, one or more, they join and we nt Œ left us. And that™s what, you know, you have your information there. Q: Okay. And do you remember leaving the camp? Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 53A: Oh yeah. Q: Tell me about that. A: I know that the sleds came, but my mom wasn™t pack, and she felt Œ she has premonition, bad premonition not to leave, you know. And she didn™t want to leave the baby there, either, you know. And we beg her, and she just was walking forth and back. And then one man that was nice to us, you know, that many times helped, I think, with the trunk and things like that. He came and start hel Œ putting things, packing and taking to sled. But our mom didn™t want to leave. Q: She didn™t want to leave the camp? A: No. Something Œ she felt that ba d things will happen, something. Q: Isn™t that Œ A: Yeah. Q: Okay. A: I think she Œ she had, few times, you know , she mentioned, that came true later on. Q: But eventually she did leave? A: Yes. Q: And you did leave. A: Yes. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 54Q: And where did you go? A: Oh, to the first Œ that™s when we could Œ we Œ all of us couldn™t ride. My mom could, and I don™t know if one of Œ that bo th of us couldn™t ra Œ ride. I think the horses was probably very tired, or something. And so, like my sister says, we were walking, and one Œ I don™t know if which day was that, if that™s as first or second day. We wanted my mom not to worry, so we thought we will run ahead of the Œ all the Œ those sleds. So we ran, ran, ran, until we couldn™t see them. Then we got cold, and we waited, you know for them to come. And next morning, I woke up, I couldn™t stand up on my feet, my legs swell all the way here, like big, you know. So my mom had to carry me, and she, you kn ow, she shouldn™t heavy Œ lift me at all. And so she begged that lady that was driv ing, if she could Œ one more person could get the ride. So she Œ something she gave her that finally she agreed. So I was sitting and my sister was walking behind. And in the snow, to walk, that™s not picnic. Q: No. A: It™s very Œ and those Œ when you ride, that™s so many sleds, and that ro Œ the snow froze, and that makes that special noise when our sn Œ in Chicago we get below z Œ zero. When I went to feed my birds, when I walk, that™s the noise my feet was making. It™s special, that noise, you know. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 55Q: Mm-hm, it crunches, in some ways. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Q: Yes. A: And you hear all that noise that, you know, because so many sleds riding. Anyway, so then on, my sister Œ and then from time to time my mom will exchange her, you know. Q: So Œ but Œ but basically Œ basically yo u were able to now ride, but your mom would sometimes let your sister sit further Œ A: Yeah, because she felt so sorry for my sister, and my sister felt sorry for my mom, you know. And I felt sorry for both of them, you know. Q: Yeah. A: And I felt guilty sitting there. Q: What could you do? A: Yeah, I know. Q: [indecipherable] What could you do? And so eventually you reached what place? A: Oh, the first Œ Q: Place. A: Don™t ask me for names, because she is the one with the names. Interview with Irene Sobczak Jauary 28, 2015 56Q: Okay. A2: Was. A: Now the book. Q: Yeah, the book, the book. A: So we stop for the night again, and I think that™s where my mom gave something to that woman to, you know, to bri Œ Q: You mean the knit hat?
