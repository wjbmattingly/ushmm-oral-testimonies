A: Father went to Lodz in either July or August, between June an d August, sometime in that time frame he went from Au s-when-jay (ph) to Lo dz, to his brothers. Q: But he went first to Aush-when-jay (ph), why? A: No, not to Aush-when-jay (ph), at that time Aush-when-jay (ph) wa s not in the picture. We were in Spon-she (ph). Q: Spon-she (ph), right.

De-cris-nein-ach (ph), which was on the Ninth of November, 19 38, was the result of Herschel Greenspan (ph) wh o shot Von Graff in Paris. His parent s and sister were with us in Sponshe (ph). Herschel Greensbaum, I trained with hi m, I taught him boxing. And he was my pupil actually in boxing. When he foun d out that the father and the sist er were sent away, he lived in Paris, he went and shot Von Graff. Was it Von Graff? A: I don™t remember the name. A: I just said it a minute ago. Q: We have the original telegram , a copy of the telegram sent. A: But in any case, Greenspan, he was with us when this came out when we knew about the Christal-naght (ph). I had to hide them. We had to secure him. Q: Your father was deported before Christal-naght (ph)? A: We were all deported before Christal-naght (ph), it was the reason... Q: So you were all in Spon-she (ph) during Christal-naght(ph)? Do you recall how you were notified that you have to leave, th at your being deported to Poland? A: We were arrested. Q: They went from house to h ouse and checked the citizenship? A: Absolutely. The SS men who ar rested me with two other guys there, three guys came to arrest me. He lost three box ma tches with me. I fought him three ti mes and three times he lost. He was the one who arrested me with two ot her SS men. He didn™t dare to come alone. Yes, we were all before the Christal-naght (ph) because that was the critical point which made him go and shoot Von Graff. Q: I just want to understand a little. Your passport, or your identity card said ‚stateless™? A: I didn™t have an identity card. Q: What kind of a docu ment did you have when you lived in Hannover? A: I had the normal papers you normally have. I had my birth certificate a nd my drivers license. No, I didn™t have an ID card. Q: You did not have one? A: No. I had my birth certificat e and I had my drivers license, which was a little photograph. Q: And with these two documents they identified you and deported you and your si ster was in a similar situation? A: In Germany, everybody had to be registered. So police had all, where ever you lived, that district had a police department, and in there you had to regi ster so they knew all the people who lived in their district because they were a ll registered. In other words, if I would try to go to another town and want to settle there I had to register within three days so they knew where we were and we 5 didn™t have to show anything or they didn™t take my ID, my birth certificate, or they took my drivers license. But the action was to take all foreigners, all people who did not have, or Jews who did not have the German nationality. That was the action which took place in October, 1938. Because the German Jews were not touched at that time. Q: Your father an d your mother... A: Not my mother, my mother had passed away in 1928. Q: Okay. Your father had a passport which was a Polish passport? A: He didn™t have a pass port either because he didn™t travel so there was no need for a passport. Q: I see. So, in a way he lived there with kind of, he was day to day illegal because? A: But they knew that he came from Poland, that he was a Pole. Q: I just don™t know, I™m as king. Did he have any perm anent residence papers or? A: No. He was registered as a man who lived in Hannover. Q: So without any pape rs, you were put on a train and deported? A: No, we were just all collected. Put into a concert hall and we lived there for a whole day until we were transported to the station and into cattle cars. Q: And the Poles, when you arri ved at Spon-she (ph), did Poles make lists of who has arrived? A: No. The Poles wouldn™t let us in. We were in Normansland for forty-eight hours before they let us in. Q: At the factory that...? A: No. It was a boundary with wire s and they didn™t let us in. The Poles didn™t want to let us in so we had the SS standing on one side with the bayonets in our eyes, on the other side were the Poles with bayonets on their rifles. Bu t then, for some interven tion, they opened up and let us into that small little village in As-bon-shee (ph). Q: Do you recall a visit of A-lin-grin-glum (ph) in As-bon-shee(ph)?

A: All through the ghetto he was always there for her. 7 Q: Do you have any idea why they didn™t get married during the..? A: She wouldn™t dare get married in the ghetto. A: She was afraid to get married. Q: Why? A: I think that, Bebof (p h) had a crush on her. A: First of all, we weren™t allowed to marry officially. A: And Jews weren™t really allowed to marry so when you saw these people getting married like 1920 couples with a handkerchief and it was an inside affair. Jews weren™t suppose to have children or... Q: When you say that Bebof (ph) had a crush on her, I mean, was that very clear? Did he send her things or, and so she afraid that he would get angry if she got married? A: No, no, she, I know every time she had a meeting or something she was sick . She got ulcers. She was so petrified. We knew sh e was scared but she would never tell us it. When we asked she never said anything. Even after th e worst. We wouldn™t talk about it at all. But we saw that she was scared and we saw her reaction.

A: And he spoke Yiddish to Dora too and she knew Yiddish well? A: But he could not speak Polish to us because we didn™t speak Poli sh. We spoke English, my wife, I courted her in English. That was the only common language we had. So he spoke Yiddish. Q: Did he test many women who had secretarial skills? A: You know, when she talks I co me to think about it.

And the reason for it was that they wanted to have an easy job going to the houses and collect whom they wanted to collect. Q: This was a fairly unusual activity in that the Germans themselves came in, right? A: No, they always came in. A: They never asked our permission. 12 A: You see, Na-ba-loskie (ph) is where you had the central office, okay? You had the ghetto far-vadoonk (ph) which was Bebo f (ph) and cohorts and you had our people, Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Aaron Yakovobitch had his office th ere and from there everything was, th at was the central point of all the activities within the ghetto. And what the transports are concerned they went on until actually even in ‚43, we still got transports into the ghetto. They called people and brought them in the ghetto. They brought some people, put th em in the cemetery and shot th em. And they hung people and they shot them, but it was outside, not within. Within we had also shootings, like for instance, in the Krim-a-nall Po-da-sigh (ph), Gooby Oben-stein-er (ph) who was the big shot there was sitting, when he was drunk he was sitting at the window and there was like a sniper, shooting. Whether he killed someone or not, he just started to shoot, that™s all. Q: I understood, and if you know, in all the pictur es of the, whether they ar e arrivals or deportations, this is so difficult for me and I will ask yo u to show me the... A: Well, whatever I can he lp you with we are here. Q: The only ones that we recognize as Gay-sphel (ph) the Germans, we can see the German soldiers as opposed to others that you don™t, th at you see Jewish police, ghetto police? A: The ghetto police had to go with them in al l actions. They were forced to. In other words, the SS would come in w ith trucks and the Jewish police had to work with them. Q: And I understand that. A: Because they had to interpret. Q: And I see these columns walking. Like 5,000 people walking to Mechelen and I don™t see any Germans in the picture. Except for the Gay-schel (ph), would they actually come and grab people from the hospital and from th e old peoples home and...? A: The Germans, when the transport went out, you wouldn™t see them but you would see them at the tracks. There they would be. They would do the loading into th e cattle cars. So you would not see any escorts at Rather-gorch (p h). You would not see them on the way to Rather-gorch (ph). There you would see only our own police. Q: In the Chronicle it says at a point in ‚42 one of the people who, for instance he writes, a very curious thing is happening, he writes. The trains leave with people for labor and their luggage is coming back. And he doe sn™t go into, he doesn™t draw any co nclusions that it means these people went to death, but he kind of writes, it is very strange that their clothes should come back and we should have to clean them and sort them. A: Well, this leaves yourself to various interpretations. Becaus e normally when you come into a camp you had to get rid of everything, or your clothing and yo u get fresh clothing. A: You know wh at happened? Q: So that was the rationalization? A: All right. A: I will tell you what happened. My sister-in-law, my brother™s widow, she built Auschwitz. She lived in Ka-to-beet-sa (ph), it™s very close to Ausc hwitz, and they grabbed her, she was 14 years old. Her family was shot, everybody of he r famil y was shot. She was left 14 years, a girl before the war in Europe was very sheltered. And she was take n to Auschwitz, they were building the barracks at that time, she told us. And then, they put her to the Prin-ya (ph), laundry. Every piece of Jewish clothing was checked out and you wouldn™t believe th e stuff that they found in this, in buttons, diamonds, there was a lot of dollars and paper mo ney was found and some people, when they were in Auschwitz they collected it, they had connecti ons and when they came out after the war they had... Q: Do you mean Auschwitz or do you mean Bruckenau? 13 A: I am talking about Au schwitz. I don™t know the distinctio n between Bruckenau and Auschwitz, I know this was the center of poi nt when people heard this. A: We know that Bruckenau was where the crematoriums and where the gassing took place. Not in Auschwitz but in Bruckenau. A: [Inaudible] We were in Auschwitz. We were a few years ago, three years ago. We went, we took a pilgrimage to Auschwitz. A: The working camp was Au schwitz and the final soluti on took place in Bruckenau. Q: When I look at you and I try to think in the standards of war time. You look good, I mean you are a beautiful woman today, but you looked good , you looked airy and you looked, you know, blue eyes, and, did it occur to you to run away and hide? A: Yes. I got married in order to survive. Not to him, I was married for three months and later on I got a ________. He wa s my father™s age, or maybe a little bit older, but my parents told me I was... Q: Polish man, or? A: He was a Jew. [inaudible] A: The police. We call them the OD man. _____________. A: And this is why I wanted to run away, but my parents, the factory was still going full swing and my mother was telling me in the First World War they were having a paradise in Poland. They were working for the Kaiser you know and they were making mone y and they didn™t want to, my mother didn™t want to leave. My father wanted to leave. And th en, my mother said to me, your going away and we are left behind. This is when I changed my mind. Q: So you married this man in or der to, how would it help you to run away if you were married? A: Because I would have some body to take care of me. I was a spoiled young girl. Q: When the ghetto was already closed was there a possibility, were there some individuals that could get away? A: A lot of them fled and went to Russia. Q: After the closing of the ghetto? A: They could get out, some of them. A: Before and after. If you realize, people smugg led them out but most of them, most of the, they fled in ‚39 when the war broke out. A: They survived in Russia. A: Then they fled, okay? And went East. And they wound up an d they survived in Siberia. A: I bet you know that in Poland th e family ties were very close so you couldn™t do anything. You would live all your life with a guilt complex. It™s true! You couldn™t just do whatever was good for you. Q: It™s a long story? A: Yes, everybody has long stories to tell. Q: When it became scary in the ghetto and you understood that people are taken away. Did you think of leaving and, you know? A: I couldn™t. I had a big packag e. I had my parents and my br other and my aunt s and my uncles and the whole families. We didn™t live for ourselves, we shared our lives. Q: Your parents, they had a factory here? Were th ey able to have some go ld or some material or? A: Of course, we had a lot of je welry. But we exchanged it for the last supper before they took us away. We gave away to a person th at is alive, I don™t know if you heard about She-mek-fel-don (ph). He was working the ______________ with the Germans and he had connections. Q: And he would give it to the Germans and get something? A: He exchanged it and he brought us the food and he was left to clean the ghetto also. 14 Q: One of the 600? A: No, it was close to thousa nds in the ghetto to clean. Officially I think it was 800 but there were a lot of people hidden. And he sort of ______ with the wh ole family, a few brothe rs and his sister and parents. And after the war they went to Israel. He™s now in Sal-o Pal-o (ph). Q: Did your parents survive? A: Pardon me? Q: Did your parents survive? A: My mother. My father was killed three days after the initial civil war. 3rd of May. He was on the march and he couldn™t walk. He was with my brother, so they sh ot him and we tried to find out where, what. We never found anything. Q: Can we break from the photogra phs for a moment? This is Susi e Goldstein from collections and I actually don™t know you. Q: I™m Diane Salsen in the curator department. Q: This is Irene Fleming. What I don™t know is ho w long we have this room, we may have to go to ________. I think she wants to take information now ab out the artifacts which I think will be an interesting experience. A: Who get™s this, ah...? Q: I get those. Susie gets... A: So should I give it to her now? Q: Yes. A: I wanted you to know that it™s our most private possessio n. It survived everything. Q: They also have a violin that Bert took out of the ghetto and ended up with. A: This is how this survived. In a casing in, also the violin, that somebody else had it. This is a calendar, the last calendar of the ghetto. With Rum-cof-ski (ph) on the front page. This is the way I got it and this is the way I put it, I don™t know what made me put this away instead of jewelry. I didn™t put any jewelry in the case. Q: There™s some writing in it. Q: There is? Q: That little bit of writing, yes, that was Bert. A: Let me see. I never looked inside. Q: Remember when I opened it, I opened it to a page where... A: You told me, but I never opened it. Q: On the left hand side of one of the pages, in the middle, I think. A: Yeah, it was done ou tside _______________. Q: This was his ID card. A: That has to be polished, I didn ™t have a chance to polish it. A: You wrote down ‚Hoc-sid e™ (ph) but I don™t know who is ‚Moi-sher™ (ph)? A: There were so ma ny Moi-sher™s (ph). Q: I™m sure that you have probably told this story before to Joan and Teresa in these past two days at least three times, but... A: They are sick of us, I know! Q: These things you put in the violin case? A: My husband has. We gave it to our grandson, a violin. So we took, we take the lining of the violin, it was a lining and he opened the lining and put in this two, the watch I had and the budda. The budda was in it. I put a little china budda that my father gave to my mother. And this was my 15 mascot. Where ever I went I had it with me. An d we put this in the lining, it survived. And I have it at home. One da y you will see it. Q: Were you in hiding? A: No. I was in ghetto. Q: But, I guess my question is how did the violin su rvive once you...? A: When they took us on the transport they told us to take some luggage. What we can carry. A: That™s the only luggage I took was my violin. A: And he took the only luggage, he took was the violin. A nd then when he came to the concentration camp they gave him the violin. A: They took it away, but the next day they gave it to us. A: They wanted them to be entertained by the... A: This friend of mine who had an accordion, his accordion was also taken away then given back to him so he could play it for that. Q: And what camp were you in? A: I? We were in ghetto Lodz and then I was in the Ravensbruck and in Zh-Hna. You know, it™s funny, amazing, that Zh-Hna is next door to the Lude r-schadt (ph) where Luder was preaching. It™s called now Vietta-Luder-Schadt-Veet -n-borg (ph) on the Elb River an d this is the church where he was preaching. Q: And you were, the camp was? A: My camp was, after the ghetto ? Reichenbach Sachsenhausen and then we were in a factory in Kurdenbukhausen (p h) which is about 33 k ilometers from Berlin. Q: And the whole time your violin went with you? A: Yes. The violin is what survived because I took it with me. After th e liberation I went always with my violin. I never let them go. Q: When you went to sl ave labor and the did not, they still did not confiscate it, which is a little unusual. Q: They took it away and then they... A: It went with us into the cattle car and then when we came to Sachsenhausen they took it away and when we were transported to Kurdenbukhausen (ph) they gave it back to us. The instruments. A: This is unique information. We have friends li ving in Israel. Dr. Veed-det (ph) that was living together so to speak with Rum-co f-ski (ph) because in the beginning , you remember, he lived in the hospital? And Stefan was there, I was there almost everyday. A: Yes. A: This friend of ours... Q: You know we are wantin g to get names from you so we can interview... A: Yes, I will give you names and addresses. He is still alive, retired. He was patronizing, very patronizing and his wife was a social climber. They are very good frie nds of mine, I put them together, they got married and I wa s his witness. And he really knows everything because he was living with Rum-cof-ski (ph) in the hospital in the beginning. Then there was Genia Leap-monbeard (ph), she was in charge of the children in Mar-ee-she (ph)... A: The orphanage. A: ...and she lives in Paris but I don™t know her married name. We can find out. But these people were there at the source. They were kind of gray elements. They didn™t have a physical position but they were everywhere, wher e it pays to be, understand? Q: And do you want to go ahead and give us th e calendar and then...? 16 A: Oh, most definite ly. You see, I gave my daughters, in this violin I had two rings. They were made to open up and we had sien-ka-lee (ph) in it, ar senic, in case the time comes that we can™t take it anymore we were going to use it. My mother knew about it and sh e got rid of it, she says, every moment you are breathing you are alive, you have hope. So, what ever should happen will happen and she got rid of it and we just, these rings we have and our daughter has them. Q: And this, Teresa actually picked it up before I saw what it was, but it™s a case? A: This was a case for identification but it crumbl ed. I had it here not long ago, but it was never used. Q: This was not a typical case? A: No, it was... Q: This was a present given to Bert from... A: From his workers. It says here, to our dear l eader art-by-lieb-shen-stop-da-di-luk (ph) in German and the date. Q: And his name then was Bernard Fuchs. A: Yes. These are the things that I put in the safe . Isn™t that funny, you see, my cousin came over and she, her brother had TB, youn g man, beautiful young man. He was bleeding, coughing, so she came to me, she needed quad-goolin (ph), you know what that is? It™s a medication that stops bleeding and we didn™t have it in the ghetto and these people that I mentions to this lady before they had connections. They were smuggling, so I went to him, he™s alive, he™s in Miami, and I told him what I needed. He got it for me, he was a good friend of mine , and my cousin, her father was my father™s partner in the business, wanted to give me a lot of diamonds. I sai d, what do I need, I don™t care about, I cared about having a full stomach, who cares about jewelry, about things. End of Tape 1. 17 Tape 2 A: There™s age and I wanted to r un away. Everybody was running to Russia to save themselves. I wanted to go but I was young and I didn™t know life rea lly. So my parents ma de me stay. I got a guilt complex, you want to go and say, but I got married and I got stuck, but after three months we parted and he fell in love with my cousin. He was with my cousin unt il they separated and she perished. Q: And when did yo u meet Mr. Fuchs? A: I met him maybe close to a year later when I separated. Q: That information we have on tape. They married in ‚43, right? A: June ‚43. Q: Ten months after you had met. A: Yeah. Q: They were married by Rum-cof-ski (ph) right? A: Yup, sure. Q: With 18 other couples? A: Sure. I think it was 19 couples with us. Q: I think there are pictures of that in the press shot. A: I have pictures... Q: Unfortunately she didn™t bring them. A: I didn™t know that. I didn™t know if you are in terested because, as I said, Hanya Gross gave me a lot of pictures. This is the only thing that I had, what I got from him and what people send us from Argentina, the pictures. Q: The cigarette case that Teresa is copying? Did you also want to do nate the cigarette case? A: Yes, I want to donate my most precious possessions, they are. You see, I was hesitating to give it to my daughter, my older daught er is very active, second generation. She™s very outspoken, very vocal. So I gave her these rings and I figure, what is she going to do with that? And this is a piece of history. Q: Do you want to tell me a lit tle bit about the cigarette case? A: I cannot tell you anything about it, my husband got it from, I thin k, Bert, did you get the cigarette case for your birthday or something? A: My birthday in 1941. A: Oh, I didn™t know hi m at that time, but his people gave it to him. A: The date is engraved on that cigarette case. September 17, 1941. Q: And who gave you the case? A: The workers in his department... A: My personnel. A: That worked for him. I met you a year and a month la ter. It™s cold in here. (Looking at pictures) A: What picture is that? Q: This is of the cigarette case. A: Came out pretty good. A: Bertie, don™t you think that they should get in t ouch with Moo-lock (ph)? A: I don™t know but he has, he might have... A: Yakovobitch™s son. A: Ivan Yakovobitch™s son. A: And Laura™s (ph) nephew. And they live in Florida. 18 Q: Do you think they mi ght have things from... A: Oh sure they have it. A: He might even have the golden bridge which was taken off my cigarette case. A: This is what we suspect. Q: That he has the golden bridge taken off the back? A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, we gave it to him and he probably gave it to his, one thing I know that they hid things, so this is how this survived I guess. We gave it to Dora™s husband and he gave it to his brother. But th e bridge as you see is taken so we suspect that they have it. Q: And there was a bridge made like this? A: On the back side. Q: The Lodz bridge on the back, but it™s not there. A: Do you know that the ghetto was divided by bridge and the people went from this holder on this side was what you would see when you see from the other side still where, and it disappeared. After the war it was hidden. It ™s not Munich anymore. Q: So, it was, the case was something that was not carried with you? A: No, no, no. It was too heavy. Q: Could you have entruste d it with somebody else? A: Yeah, we entrusted it to Erik Yakovobitch. Because I know they had a lot on the premises of the hospital. Q: To people that weren™t hiding or? A: No. He surviv ed after the war. Q: Was he one of the last group to stay in Lodz? A: Yes. No, no, he was in our transport. A: He was with me. Q: So then, how was this found? A: Because he had it left in the hospital. They dug it... A: He left it somewhere, in other words, they hid it somewhere in a secure place and then after the war they went and dug it out again. Q: This isn™t saying that it™s Yakovobitch that made that case, is it? The three brothers who lived in Lodz that are Lee and Yakov obitch and his two brothers? A: No. A: Oh, this... A: The other three brothers Yakovo bitch. I know what you are talk ing about. No, these are not the ones. There were just two brothers. Alan and Bobeck. Q: okay. A: Oh, your talking about the people that lived in Spring Valley, these brothers? But they were with you on the transport. We knew ever ybody that was on the transport. We had like 300 people. But, you know it™s so many year s ago. I don™t remember. A: You think they would be interested in taking this to their archives? Q: The archives? A: These artifacts, yes? Q: Oh yes, absolutely. A: This is what Lusik (ph) wanted when he came to visit us and he wanted Bert™s diary, I told you the diary we have, but I didn™t give it to him. He wanted it so badly. This was before he wrote the book, he came to us an d spent the day with us. Q: You haven™t Xeroxed the diary? Becau se what I™m worried about it that... 19 A: It™s hardly visible. A: Well, I didn™t have a pen. I wrote in pencil you know and I wrote at night. Q: Can you read it now? A: I think I still would be able to read it, to make it out. I have to take it and I have to record it. A: If you would have a forensic department I th ink they would be able to do something about it, but it™s fading. It™s so faded. Q: I was just wondering if we should get it copied so that at le ast there is a permanent record of it? A: I don™t think I wo uld make it public because it™s all pers onal. My life, my feelings, you know, and happenings if th ere were something. Q: Do you think at some point you might want to make it availa ble, even 100 years from now? A: If I would make it availabl e I would make it available fo r my children maybe. But... A: You should read it out at least... A: Well, I said, I would have to read it first in E nglish, er, in German and then eventually translate it with... Q: We could tape record it... A: I would tape record it. A: __________ have been coaxing him for years to do it. Q: Well somebody should just come to the house with a tape reco rded, who doesn™ t know German so they don™t understand what your doing, and you just read it out in Germ an and at least there is a record because it™s important to have something like that. A: I will try to do that. A: He can do it by hi mself, he doesn™t need anybody to do it... Q: Well, but sometimes you need someone to just come and say, okay, now we are going to do... A: I have two tape recorders, but both are in need of repair. Q: I could have Jodie, Jodie do esn™t understand any German so whatever your saying is safe. A: Well, I translated some for her. Q: Oh, you did? A: For the, she made a video tape for the Museum in Houston, Texas and they showed me the video and I made them in English and the titles, sub titles. A: Oh, it™s really so, like _______ all those years, it was so touching to get th is. How could he have hidden it, I don™t understand? A: I hid it in my straw mattress. A: They looked through our... A: Every night in a different spot. A: They cut open all of our straw mattresses. A: No, they didn™t cut mine. But in any case I hid it in the mattress every night I put it in a different spot. Q: Did you write everyday? A: Yes. Everyday I wrote. Q: How did you find eac h other after the war? A: I found him. Q: It™s a very long story. A: Yeah, it™s a long story. Q: ________ going back to Lodz? A: No, no, no, no. I had nothi ng to go back to anymore. Q: When did you finally re-unite? 20 A: August 8, 1946, right? A: 1945. Q: And were either of you in displaced persons camp? A: No. We were never in a camp. We had a r oom with a German family and this is how we... A: We were separated in October of ‚44 and we found each other in August, ten months. Q: These two are for you. A: Oh, thank yo u very much. Q: One you can read this better and the othe r you can see this better, so you have both. A: I™ll give these to the girls, Bert. Q: And if you need more copies we can always make more. Q: Or we can photog raph the for you. A: Oh this would be nice because I want to give it to my daughters. Q: We can have them photograph the whole collection and then we can give you copies and we will always have copies. Can I ask what your address is in Connecticut? A: Yeah. (Gave addr ess and phone number) <<<<<Discussed Deed of Gift, custody receipt and other factors here.>>>> Q: Would you like, for instance, if somebody co mes in from the outside world and they want to look up your collection, would it be clearer for them to look under ‚Fuchs™ or would it be clearer to look under ‚Fleming™? A: Under ‚Fuchs™ because not everybody knows that we changed our names. Q: It™s F-U-C-H-S. A: Yes. Q: okay. A: And the first name is Bernard. Q: Their doing some ceremony here, there is suppose to be food so I™m assuming that their not going to just walk in and we™re going to be in some very uncomfortable position? A: What kind of ceremonies do they have here? Q: I don™t know, somebody™s getting an award. Q: I™m sure you told Susie, but what was the occasion? A: That he got it? For his birthday. From the employees, and one is from... A: One is from two OD men. There were two British men who were assigned to... Q: Ko-vo-is-key (ph)? A: Yes, and one is David Pyttl. Q: What was his first name? A: David. A: Sima, it™s a Russian name. Q: So these were the two? A: The two OD policemen who were assigned to me, yes. A: They were the, a lot of peopl e came to the office so they t ook care of the order, really. Q: And was it personally from these two or? A: No, the whole department. A: The plaque on top is specifically from these two. An d the other one... A: Turn it around. Th is is where the bridge was. The same workmanship like this, somebody thought it was valuable because it™s gold, gold plated. A: And the other one is from the pe rsonnel, from the first personnel. Q: The top one or th e bottom one? What is this one, the one on the top right? 21 A: The one on top in front of the book is from the original first personnel and this is from the complete personnel because I had a staff. The book form is from my personal staff, from the executive staff. And this is from all the personnel. Q: I see. So each one paid for the separate plaque? A: I don™t know how they did it, but they had it engraved, yes. Q: And they presented it to you as a whole? A: Pardon me? Q: They presented it to you as a whole, complete, as it is now with the rest? A: No, it was with the bridge on it. Q: Is your birthday actually on the 17th of September? A: That™s correct. Q: Because one year says 29th of May? What is that? A: Yes. Q: Why is that? A: They added this on. Q: I see, I see. Q: Why did they add that on? A: Well, they wanted to be part of it. Q: So when it was first given to you did it look like this or they added something later? A: No, it was just like this and the bridge, then they took it and added this. Q: I see. I may take th is photo as well. Do yo u mind if I do that too? A: That™s why my staff, they had it made up in the factor y and then they had it engraved. Q: You had metal works, right? There were engr avers in the? A: We had everything in the ghetto. Everything. A: We had very creative people. Q: And where did such material come from for this kind of th ing? Do you know? A: People told you that we had to have ein-kof-s ent-ral (ph), it means... A: People came there and... A: We had given everything valuable, jewelry... A: So they went and received mo ney or other valuables for that. A: But they received ghetto money. A: Well, naturally. What else? Q: So the bridge that was on th e back, when it was taken, are you just assuming somebody didn™t take the whole thing and take away the whole cas e they just wanted it, just took off the back? A: This is what they wanted. I don™t know if they wanted it for the value of it. There is no value. Or they had it as a historical piece of history. A: Or for the gold. Q: When did you re cover this object? A: After the war, after th e liberation, we got that from my brother-in-law. Q: Did you get it when you were back in Hannover? A: We were in Hannover. Q: And that™s when you got it? A: Yes. Q: When you found your brother, when your brother came? No, you found your brother before? A: No. My brother-in-law. 22 A: I told you half of it. That we were feeding a fellow from my home town and when he went back to Lodz he put it in the, and my brother knew where we are and he found us. He came to us. Q: Right. A: Because everybody, you know, wa s seeking someone, searching for him, searching for her, everybody was trying and that wa s all over the area. In Germany, in Poland, everybody was looking to find relatives or closer ones. Q: What was your brother™s name? A: David. A: And then the radio, ev ery morning, anno unced who was seek ing who there. A: Last name S-A-L-O-M-O-N-O-W-I-C-Z. Then he changed it to Salomn (ph) when he became a citizen they told him that he should change his name because... A: Did Irene tell you? I had a fr iend who lived near Hannover in a small place and he was a joker. He always was full of jokes and on e morning, it must have been about quarter of four, after three in the morning, he rang my bell. I was half asleep and I went and ope ned the door and he said, I heard on the radio that your sister is looking for you and I answered it, and I took him and almost killed him. I said, don™t make such a joke, take me out of sleep, so he went on his knees and said, everything that is holy, I am telling the truth! Sure enough , about ten days later she came. Q: He was the one who told you about Irene? A: He answered the radio station to my sister that I was alive and liv ed in Hannover. We have a lot of photographs to go through yet, huh? Q: Yes, but I think what we™ll do is we will take a break and you can either go to the cafe and eat something or you can go to the permanent exhib ition and see who you can see and then you can come back and help them ou t with more photographs. A: What are we doing for lunch? Q: Well, the closest place is the caf e. We can bring you back lunch, if you want. We can go to the cafe and get lunch and you can come and eat in my office, if you want? Or you can go to the cafe yourselves and sit there? A: I think it would be nice if we can lunc h in your office, that would be all right. Q: okay. We can ge t things for you. A: __________ name is Teresa? Q: Teresa, yes. I don™t kn ow what she™s, she™s trying to make a more perfect... Q: Now she took the other one. A: Now she took the calendar? Q: Yes. A: The calendar and... A: And the leather case. Q: With a calendar like that, how many might be printed? Would thousands be printed or? A: I have no idea. Q: Where would you get it from? A: I told you, my professor was in charge of the newspaper and pr inting and people were getting the newspaper. It was printed for the people. Q: No, I mean, where would yo u get something like that? A: I would assume that ther e would be a few thousand. Q: And given out to just a few people? A: And given out to at least the department heads. 23 Q: Did you walk arou nd in the course of the day, going to the different factories and talking with people or did you mainly stay in your office? A: No, I walked around too. I vis ited the various resorts all the time. Q: And were you looking for particular things, were you looking to see... A: No, just what the conditions were. What I could do to improve it or when I criticize. I had quite a task. I pulled quite some weight in that sense b ecause even if he was a di rector of the factory he still had to, if I said something, it was that word. It had to be done. And on the other end I also patted him on the shoulder if he did something well so it went both ways. Yes, I did go around. But I always had one with me, one of my OD men. Q: When you would go to the place s would people run up to you and talk to you or would they stay working? A: They would come. Ask me for favors or something. A: He was very accessible, Bert. Q: And the other workers, you had 40 or 50 other people workin g for you, were they mainly in the office or did they also walk arou nd so they could report to you? A: No, they were mainly in th e office because to keep up the data, we didn™t have computers naturally so everything had to be done by hand so we kept pretty busy. Q: Did you have to make labor ch arts about who was working where? A: No, but we had to register definitely all the personnel to which we are, and somebody got a delegation to that factory it was put onto the index cards. Q: So you could trail where the pe ople, they had gone from this fa ctory to that factory so you knew exactly? A: Yes, absolutely. Q: Are those cards still available? A: Well that depends on... A: He had something. A: He™s the one that donated everything to... A: To the Vi-vel (ph). A: And he told us that he saved, he was left with the crew to clean up and then the Russians came and liberated them. This is how he kept everything intact. All his papers, everything what was Rum-cof-ski (ph) he has, he had. I don™t know what, but I know he donated it a lot. Q: Now I know in Lodz, what? Q: In some cases, here but I™m not sure if it was... A: Not On-zone-o-vitch (ph). I know he told us that he donated an awful lot here. Q: There are cards in Lodz now, th at I know, with the na mes of a lot of people. Where they were living. Which is something else I wanted to ask y ou. I wanted to show you the map. We have a list of the ghetto inhabitants and your listed here. As living in Belzar (ph). A: Yes. Q: Now, where was that? A: Belzar-nacht (ph). Let™s see that. A: It was next to Rib-now (ph), Bert. A: One moment. A: You have to go by Lud-no-mie r-skein (ph), it™s a side street. A: Yes, right here. Bazarro (ph), Bazar Plats, it™s right here. Q: And what™s this other street , Huntz, what does that mean? A: Hundrea-auten (ph)? I have no idea. 24 Q: So you were Bezar (ph) Seven? A: Yeah. I don™t know what this Handrea-auten (ph) means here. Q: Unless it means we™re in or near th at street? I didn™t see it anywhere. A: No, I don™t even know Hundrea-auten (ph) street. Q: Maybe it™s one of the closest main streets? A: Like Aud-nitz-k a (ph), Hundrea-auten (ph) is like... Q: Yes, so it™s over there. I don™t know why, it ™s very strange. A: Here was the bridge, you see? Q: That™s where the bridge... A: That™s the bridge we are talk ing about. There were two bridges and gates. There were some gates here. They are not marked, the gates are not marked. Only the bridges are marked here. There was a hospital. Q: There was an Aryan street? A: So, what they meant here Huandy-aut-en-scht az (ph), what they meant covered the Huandy-auten-schtaz (ph) so that they had to go from there to here, you know? Shou ld have said humble-auten-schtaz (ph) rather than Huandy-aut-en-schtaz (ph). Q: Right, because th at™s much closer? A: Right. Q: And this is the train tracks, the trolley tracks? A: The trolley. The trolley went there. <<<<Inquiring about lunch, what to eat>>>> A: So you are not disappointed? Getting enough information? Q: Yes. (inaudible), but I™m gettin g more. How did you feel about it? A: I had a very restless night. I do n™t know, I tried to knock it out. A: And you were talk ing I want you to know, but I couldn™t understand about what. A: I was mumbling? A: Yes. Q: Did you have dreams last night? A: No. A: I didn™t drea m last night too. A: Yeah, at one time you were saying someth ing too and I touched you and you stopped. Q: Did you have particular things that were bothering you last night? A: I don™t recall. I know I was very restless and I looked at the cl ock almost every hour. A: I know we wanted to walk and get something to eat. We walked, we couldn™t find it, so we went back to the hotel and we ate downstairs. They should close the place, but they served people, it™s unbelievable. And the prices! A cup of soup, watery so up, five dollars! Q: I think we have to change the hotel. A: Yes, you should. Q: I™m going to tell Chris. A: Oh, it™s a depressing place, very depressing. Q: Where are you staying? A: In the Holiday Inn on Franklin Square. Q: I don™t like the area. So, you couldn™t find the restaurant I told you about? A: No we didn™t. A: I went to ﬁKﬂ and... Q: ﬁKﬂ and 17th, I think. 25 A: Oh, we went to 16th and then we went back . So, what are you go ing to do with this? A: It™s a beautiful piece, isn™t it? Q: Yes, it™s interesting. I think this is something that™s easy for us to just put into the permanent exhibition because we have that ca se with all the currenc y. I mean, I would ask Yatz-ka (ph) if we could contribute that because it™s so small. And it™s in great condition. A: It™s in good co ndition, isn™t it? Q: But this is such a __________ __, I would hope we would have an opportunity to exhibit it, but also to be very clear in the text what it was. Especia lly because it™s really very significant because of the odyssey or, it made it really something that is connected with the Jewish people. It™s been very lovely meeting you. I hope the re st of your stay he re is _____________. A: We leaving tomorrow mo rning. Nice meeting you. Q: I am trying to think if we should move into my office and they can have some lunch because if they are going to come in here. Are there other things that we want to do, do a few more things with photographs now? A: There were some photographs... Q: We could do it after lunch. A: We can continue, but I think it™s pretty awkwar d if she looks at one an d I look at one and... Q: Your right. We probabl y should do one at a time. A: Maybe, the ten more minutes that we have. If you could sit here. A: Shall I take it over there, or should I just, oh, fi nish this one? Do you want us to finish this one? Because there are not too ma ny left as I can see. Q: I very much want to show y ou the deportation photos, for you to tell me what is what, what is coming and what is going. A: Women! ______ _______ and ______________. All right.

He had a lot of friends but he had enemies also. Quite a few of them. Q: You said that you met people that actually saw Rum-cof-ski (ph) being killed? Not just heard that he had been killed?

And after the war, we found out he™s alive so we went to Munich to visit him. He was doing great. Q: And he told you ab out Rum-cof-ski (ph)? A: He told us everything we know because we didn™t circulate. We were ve ry withdrawn, Bert had enough with his job when he came to, when we came after work we were so exhausted. Life was tough.

A: This was... A: No, this was Dabby-dov ich (ph), Bert. I don™t see Joseph Rum-cof-ski™s (ph) wife anywhere. And here, I made the sign that there was something wrong here... Q: Better put a question mark. A: These friends of ours in Isr ael, the Dr. Vied-der-nany™s (ph) wi fe, they were there daily with these people and they know so much because we we re _______. Bert was visible but they never saw us at parties and stuff like that. Q: Who is this? A: This is Mrs. Dabby-dovich(ph). A: Josef Rum-cof-ski™s (ph) wife. A: Well, maybe you are right. But this is the same, what did they write here? They should know if this was his wife. Q: No, we couldn™t know. A: Mordiah Heim(ph). Q: Is that Josef™s wife? A: Yeah. Q: You think it™s Mrs. Dabby-dovich (ph)? A: Yeah. And this here, she is here too. Q: Do you think this is...? A: This is Josef™s Ru m-cof-ski™s (ph) wife. Q: Do you know her name? A: Helen, I guess. I d on™t know. I don™t recall. But this was his wife. A: I hardly knew the woman, or saw her. A: This was Josef™s wife. Sh e™s in that picture we had. A: And the rest , I looked... Q: Who is that? A: I don™t know. Q: How observant was Rum-cof-ski (ph) of the whol e administration? Like on the calendar, all the Hebrew dates are written and all the holidays are written and he was...?

Q: Is that in the ghetto or was that before the ghetto? A: Before. Q: But, in the ghetto, was ther e observance of the holidays? A: No. I don™t see ho w, no there was nothing. Q: This is, well, heavy stuff! A: It is, it is. Especially for people that have been there. Q: I would like to go back to the Gish-telv (ph)... A: This is Mill-ka-tee Ma-no-skee™s (ph) father. He was always with, I noticed him when we were in the ghetto. He was always there. This was my gi rlfriend™s father. Q: And what is this, here? A: He worked in the kitchen. Kitchen nu mber, I don™t know, I can see ‚2™ I think. Q: Let me bring quickly the deport ation, but in this fa mous speech, ﬁGive me your children, give me your...ﬂ? A: I never heard it. A: That™s Josef Rum-cof-ski (ph), they say it™s Heim Rum-cof-ski (ph). A: Yeah, his younger brother. Q: What was his function? A: He was in charge of the health department of th e hospital. Wasn™t he the chief of the hospital in Nwad-ya-gin-skie (ph)? A: I think so. A: Stefan would know, Bertie. Q: So you never heard about this speech...? A: Never heard it. A: No, the first time I saw... Q: Did you know about the official chronicle being written? A: Yeah because Josef came to us. A: He came to us and spent a whole Sunday with us.

A: This is Rabbi Fine. 29 A: This is very important because he was a wonderful gu y, this Rabbi. Q: And what was this meeting? A: Shick-a (ph). A: Throw up the boards, the rods , because they had from all walk s of life people from every, doctors and the Rabbi was here. A: Was it the Rabbi Finer or was it Mienster (ph)? A: Rabbi Finer. Q: There are a couple of people here that you don™t have. Th is is Rabbi Finer. A: Rabbi Finer. Dr. Shicker (ph). Q: Which one is it, yo u mean in that hat? A: Yes. From the health department. Q: Does the name ‚Frances ™ mean anything to you? A: No. A: And there™s Josef again. A: No. There were so many people. Q: I know, I know. Someti mes we shoot in the dark.

Dr. Vee-der (ph), he™s still alive, Dr. Kin-la-roos (ph) is the head of the Survivor™s... A: This is not Bebof (ph). It says here that he talks with Bebo f (ph), that™s not Bebof (ph). Sorry. A: Bebof (ph) was a handsome man. Q: There™s another photograph that says that. A: Yes. We identified that yesterday. Yeah, th ey are identified.

A: No. We went to Sa chsenhausen Regensburg. Q: Directly? A: Directly. A: Yes, so they let the men go. A: Yes, we were separated. All men out. Q: How did you know that you were suppose to be going to Auschwitz and somebody changed their mind? Because you just said that. A: Yes, but I don™t know how we know it because everything was rumors. Q: When are you starting, soon? okay, let™s take this stuff out. Mark that. A: [Inaudible]...and she was with me at the table to be interviewed. And they were talking about what she said to _________ ___ for instance. Why c ouldn™t they do in Lodz the same as in Warsaw, the uprising. So I said I™ m sorry you are complaining. 30 A: Yeah, she was obnoxious anyhow. A: I said first of all the people in Warsaw ghettos they had _______ with the outside. So they were able to exchange someth ing for weapons and ammun ition. We had absolutely no contact with the outside world. We were absolutely isolated and wh at could we do? To fight the Germans with bare fingers? It would have been suicide! Q: You shouldn™t feel defensive, it™s ummm... A: Yeah, but I mean, she said it in front of the camera. A: She was so arrogant. She said something that I was very, very up in arms, what was it? And this young editor from th e For-vert (ph)... A: There was a Jonathon Rosen. So, he asked me, tell us what or how did you feel at that time when you had to collaborate with the Germans? A: I could have killed him. A: So I told him, we had to work to eat and if Rum-cof-ski (ph) would have been not able to negotiate with the Germans, to give us materials, raw material s, and we would manufacture and would deliver the completed goods to them in exchange for money and food. Whatever we needed in the ghetto and if he would have been successful in that negotia tion the Lodz cater (ph) would have been liquidated in 1943 completely. A: 1942 already... A: In 1942, I™m sorry. I meant ‚42. Completely. No body would have left at that time alive. They would have had to find a solution at that time. A: There was a young man, an edit or of the For-vitz (ph), Jonat hon Rosen. Very lovely young man. So he said, who are we to judge if we didn™t live there? A: And everybody had their individual experiences so who are we to tell them or to judge of what was good and wh at was bad. Q: To what extent at that time, not today, but at th at time were you aware that the Lodz ghetto is so different from others? A: No. We didn™t have any knowledge of that. A: We found out after the war. We didn™t know it. A: We didn™t even know that ther e exists other ghettos in Warsaw. Q: You didn™t know? A: No. Because all from this, from the little vill ages and surrounding towns, they sent it into the Lodz ghetto. What was the two brothers that came from the Warsaw ghetto to us? A: Cone (ph). A: The brothers Cone (ph). They came from Warsaw to the Lodz ghetto and they told us about the Warsaw ghetto. A: And this is when we found out. This was to wards the end. And she could tell them, one of the daughters is alive in Fairlong, New Jersey. Q: I hear that people in Lodz before the ghetto was sealed... A: Closed. Q: Closed. They figured that it™s better to go to Warsaw because this is not going to be annexed to the Reich as opposed to Lodz which became part of the Reic h and so they were afraid... A: Who knew that they would annex th e Lodz city...? Q: Wasn™t it right away announced? A: I™m sorry. I have to butt in because I lived through it. My father, when the Germans started to invade, to come into Lodz, my father and my brot her went to Warsaw because every patriotic Pole 31 went to defend the City of Warsaw. And my father came back must be a week later, his feet were bleeding and he looked, he wa s a shadow of a person, they tried to walk towards Warsaw. End of Tape 2. 32 Tape 3 Q: Jumping to 1944, did you feel or know or consider yourself in some way privileged that you were in the last transport? A: We were privileged. We were definitely privileged in the last transport. A: You were only around 300 people? A: Because they were already... A: There were a few young doct ors, a few doctors and people that use to work close in the administration. A: At that time we did not know that already are other people like Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that we would not be staying in Sachse nhausen. That we will be going somewhere else to work, in other words, it™s like slaves, like going into slave labor, okay? But we didn™t know that, only when we came to Sachsenhausen we were to ld we are not staying here. Afte r two weeks we went to Kern-eswoo-sen-hausen (ph) because the barracks were not ready. But in the mean time when we came in they were just about ready to be occupied. And then we got the straw mattresses and stuff like this. A: Wasn™t Stefan V ee-ter (ph) with you? A: Sure he was with me. A: Was he working in his profession there or what? A: He was a doctor, but... A: This is the Dr. Vee-ter (ph) I told you lives in Tel Aviv. He was with him on the transport. A: He was with us and there was another doctor with us and he wa s also on the circus saw and he lost... A: Oh, I know who it wa s. Dr. Tennenbaum. A: Tennenbaum. He lost three fing ers. He also was th e same as what I did with these big plywood plates on a circus saw. And he did the same thin g and he got his hand too close, the right hand, got to close to the circus saw and cut off three fingers. And he was a su rgeon! So afterwards he could not operate anymore because he had lost those three fingers on his right hand. Q: Could you describe the co ntrast between what you expe cted while on the train, on the transport...? A: Which transport? Q: To Sachsenhausen. And after your arrival and realizing what is going on? A: Well, until we came to Sach senhausen we were together with our women in the cattle cars. A: Cattle cars, strangers, I don™t know how many people in one, couldn™t sit down. A: Everybody knows already how the transport took us in the cattle cars. A: No, not everybod y, no. I don™t know how many people but I know we couldn™t sit down. A: Wall to wall. Shoulder on shoulder. A: I know they put with us a pail. You had to do something in front of everyb ody, you did it, strangers. Men and women. A: It was a long trip. Q: How long? A: I think it was a day and a night. A: I think it was more like two days and we didn™t have windows to look out. A: I think two days and one night, something like this. And then the train stopped. All men out! A: I will never forget th is moment, this was the worst moment in my life. A: I didn™t even say good-bye to her. A: Here was my father... A: My father, her father, her brother... 33 A: My brother! He left the train when they took them out of the train, he never looked back. He never said good-bye to me, he never looked. This picture... A: I remember! I didn™t want to say good-bye because I didn™t want to break down. I had to be strong. I knew I had to be strong. Q: What did you know, what did you think, why...? A: I had to be strong because... A: We separated, that was all we knew. A: This was the only possibility because we were separated. We were only married... A: Few months. A: No, we were married... A: We married in ‚43 Be rt and this was ‚44. A: Yes, we married in June and this was ‚44... A: About a year later. A: Yes, a little over a year. So we basically were still on our honeymoon. If you can call that, you know. First of all, I was frustr ated. Not knowing what happened ne xt, okay? And second of all, I didn™t want to see that I had tears in my eyes, I didn™t want her to se e that, so I just left out with the transport. A: And this is when I saw the last time my father. A: And we lost he r father because... A: He was about 40 years, not even 40 years old. A: And I was met at Alan Yakov obitch (ph) because he was the nu mbero uno on this transport. And one day, I was told to go outside, the outsid e commando, because they were always building tank traps because the H itler youth comes always with the ta nks over there were shooting against the Russian over our camp. One day, later on, I rea lized why he had sent me out. Because when I came back late that afternoon seventy people had left. A: My brother and my father. A: From our camp and amongst th em her father and her brother. They were amongst the seventy that were sent out and Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that if I would be in the camp I would never let them go because I would have told them that if they go, I go too. A: But he liked you and he wouldn™t... A: Well, he was like family beca use my sister was married, well , no, they were not married, but they went together, they were a pair. So, they were very close to each other. Aaro n was ever close to Dora anyhow. Q: So Bolic and Dora we re not actually married? A: No, they were ma rried after the war. A: They married in ‚45. A: But he knew, Aaron knew, that I would never, ever have allo wed my father-in-law and brotherin-law to go. Q: Where did they go? A: They went on a march to the North Sea to be put on a boat and bound out. It™s Final Solution. And he couldn™t walk anymore. So they shot him, all right? Was on May the 3rd, while my brother was able to escape. A: They told my brothe r, too, run for his life , not to hang around. And my brother survived. A: Since then, I was very, very mad. And as you say in Turkish, broy-gus-with-in (ph). A: But we are in touch with his son, would you believe it? 34 A: His son called me. They lived in Brooklyn and he called me at that time to tell me that his father had passed away. A: And he wanted us to go to the funeral. A: And were we in Scranton or were we already in... A: We were in Connecticut and th e next thing we left for Europe. A: I had to leave for Europe so I told him, I™m sorry I cannot co me to the funeral. And every Christmas I get a post card... A: Not a post card a regular letter! A: Yeah, with their family printe d on it with a long letter of what had transpired during the year of what they had done and what they had accomplished and where they go. Q: So you felt that he is aski ng your forgiveness for sending yo ur father-in-law and brother-inlaw...? A: He didn™t ask forgiveness, no. A: No, this young man, it wasn™t his fault. He™s not responsible for his father. Q: No, no, no. I am saying that you felt that Alan Yakovobitch...? A: I absolutely, absolutely. He sent me out that day because he knew that I would never allow my father-in-law and brother-in-law to leave! Q: How did Yakovobitch know that they are going to be sent on this march? A: He must have known because he was in t ouch with the German camp, with the Germans. Q: Had he worked with Bebof before? A: Sure! On the __ ___________. Absolutely. Even very close, I must say. Q: Right. So he wo uld possibly know, people would tell him things? A: Oh, sure, sure! A: He would know because, as I mentioned to you, Zi-fed (ph) from the ghetto Fuf-eitel (ph), he was also with us in Kernet-woo-sure-hausen (ph), in that factory. As a German _____________. And they were very close and I was very close with Zi-fed (ph). He was a nice guy. But, he did not know that that was my fath er or my brother-in-law. Q: He didn™t k now who it was? A: No. Q: So he was simply trying to protect you? A: But he didn™t have to protect me. Be cause I was working and I was, you know. A: So was David and Dad. A: Yes, but I mean, I was working in side the factory on a circus saw. And this day I was told to go away, okay? And then later on it happened that I got the rifle in my back, that I told you, on one of these outside commandos. Q: Can you describe that during th is day and a night or maybe two days and a night on the train, what, and you were al l from Lodz, right? A: Yes. Q: Was there any talk, any...? A: It was frustration. You were so embarrassed, you know. A: You tried to comfort each other for once. Saying to all, what will happen to us? Where will we go? A: We had to accommodate ourselves because you have to get along in this place. A: And you were actually occupied with yourself. Q: Did you think you were going to die> A: We didn™t know what to think. 35 A: We didn™t know. The po ssibility existed everyday. A: We were sure that... A: The train was stopped by the, bo mbs were falling. So we could ha ve died right there. Not from the German end but from the Allied bombs. So, we didn™t know whether we would survive or not. Q: Yes, I mean in terms of this specific policy of the Germans at th is point. Here, everybody™s left the ghetto except these 800 people? A: They told us were are going to be working. A: But they told us we were going into... Q: But did you still believe this was a real possibility? A: No, no, we doubte d it. We didn™t know what to believe. Q: No body talked about the specifics? A: No! A: No, because nobody knew! Q: When Teresa asked you whet her you felt privileged about being on the last transport, did you feel privileged in terms of your whole ghetto ex perience, given the position that you had in the ghetto? A: That was one part. In another part, that I was Dora™s brother. This definitely was a privileged. Q: Did you get more food? A: We got a little bit extra, yes. A: When we were getting, I told you, the _______ of food, it was a small portion of meat, but Bert sent it to my parents. We never saw a thin g of it! My father looked like a skeleton. A: And he was a tall man. A: Over six feet tall, six-four. A: Tall and, he needed it, definitely more than I did. Q: Did they other heads of th e departments have a barber? They were all men, right? A: I had my barber. Q: Yes, I know that. Did they all have a barber? A: Everybody had this, th is fellow, this barber , he made the rounds. A: He went, he went, he had quite... Q: To all the heads of the department? A: Pardon me? Q: To all the heads of the departments? A: To all, I wouldn™t say, but he had quite the amount of privileged people to go around and shave and cut their hair. Q: Was this in your life, prior to going to Lodz, was this a traditiona l male thing to do if you had a certain status to have somebody shave you? A: You couldn™t shave yourself. You went to the barber to be shaved. A: I went everyday to the barber. Q: When you were a kid? I mean, once you got a beard or when you grew up? A: No, no. Before, I am talking about the general life without, I am not talking about the ghetto. A: Everyone went to a barber. Q: I™m curious because it ™s not something one necessarily sees today. A: Yeah. They couldn™t do it , cut their hair. They went to the barber ever yday to shave. A: When father had this ___________ after we came back, we ha d a barber come here. Father and I to shave us. 36 Q: So this really had nothing to do with your positions in life, th is was what one would expect for the male population. A: No, no, no. But he had this circle of people around him. Q: Did your sister have a hairdresser? A: I don™t know. A: I don™t even know. Q: I was wondering if the women had an equivalent? A: You know, I couldn™t even answer th at question because I really don™t know. A: I didn™t have a hairdresser, I can assure you! We didn™t take advantage... Q: Did you ever get your hair cut? A: No. In ghetto , I had long hair. A: You started off with short hair, like now. A: Yeah. Q: But then you said before you le ft together you shaved your head? A: I shaved. This is what happened. After we left the ghetto, I had the shor ter hair than you, very crew cut. This is why they didn™t actually... A: I forgot to mention to you. I was honored by the SS in the camp. The little caps we wore, the cappies, right? And every time we passed a German... A: You had to salute him! A: We had to take our cappies off. And this gu y, he was one who was in charge of us, so called, okay? And he liked the way I salu ted him when I took off the cap. So he took me out, turned me around so I faced our people and he said, show them how to salu te! So I took my cap off, and he said, that™s the way you have to do it! And he allowe d me to let my hair grow. A: No, he was bald like now. A: My twenty-two and a half hair , I had, you couldn™t know if I ha d a haircut or not because there was nothing left. So he allowed me to have my hair cut, that was my reward. Q: To have your hair cut? A: Not cut! Everybody ha d shaved their hair off. A: In the camp. They didn™t want to ha ve the lice growing all over the place. A: And I was allowed to le t my hair grow because I knew how to salute him. A: Yeah, there were funny moments too. Q: Did you have a lot of meetin g with your staff, these forty or fifty people who were...? A: Almost every morning. Q: All of them together? A: No, not all of them. Q: Parts of them? A: The ones who are very important to me. Q: And who would that have been? A: Bel-laf-sky (ph) was one. Then that girl from Ha mburg. The German girl. A: Would you believe my governess was work ing for him? She wa s with us for the... A: Sorry, Darling, I don™ t remember their names. Q: And what would the meetings be like in the morning, what woul d you be discussing? A: Whatever was, had to be done. Q: Like what? A: Like a program. There were different occasi ons which I couldn™t tell you the details, no. But, there was always so mething which we had to do. They had to report to me. 37 A: There were so many factor ies, resorts they called them. A: They had to give a report of what they did and how it was done and so on. There was always something going on. Q: Did you have quotas for what people had to produce in each of these...? A: No, no. Q: You didn™t. So when you would go to a factory a nd look around and talk to people and, if you would criticize something, what would you criticize if something was going wrong? What would be the kind of thing th at would be going wrong? A: The cleanliness. The way, their condition s at the working places. A: He would go to the kitchen and try the food. If they don™t cheat, the workers of the food. A: I would go to the kitchen and look at the soup, which the worker s would receive, okay? Then I would make my comments, whether it was good or not good or whet her there is somebody and if I found somebody, he was fini shed with the kitchen. Q: You mean if they were stealing food? A: They were stealing. A: And we went to the factory, all right? And somebody from th e factory needing a little bit repair, would send in his place to the kitchen. Q: Did I understand correctly that you were in the first period, one of the two people that were in charge of employment or labor? A: Yeah. Q: And then you became the head of the labor? Q: No, it was the other way around. A: I was called and I was told to organize the de partment of labor because all people had to be registered to receive an ID card and without th e ID card, nobody would get the food coupons. Q: That was in the beginning or...? A: That was when I came into the ghetto. A: I have the papers still. Little pieces of paper when he was nominated to start the department. You want it? I have the original. It was lying in the little calendar. Q: I will copy it, I will only copy it. Q: That was November, ri ght, of ‚42, of ‚40? A: Yes. That was 1940. And I interviewed a lot of people for the job, for the office. A: I went with David to you, too, and I was staying in line with Dr. Kin-ee-roos (ph), he took me to you. A: Well, in any case, to answ er your question, I wasn™t no minated to organize and run the department of labor, which I did. Q: But there was another person, ri ght, that was like a co-director? A: Later on. Not originally. Q: And then, in the beginn ing of ‚44 it changed again, that yo u were the only one in charge of...? A: No, no, Shin-nit-skie (ph) was with me the whole time until the end and we got in 1943 from Czechoslovakia a transport was... A: Andres was his name. A: A 100% gentleman. A: Professor Cas-par-ee (ph) was, this is a proverb. Q: I want to know about that, that™s later, tell me about the _____________. A: He was a micro-biologist. A: And he wanted the favo r of Rum-cof-sky (ph) and he was give n to my office to be the third man. 38 Q: His name was Anders? A: No, it was Andres, A-N-D-R E-S. And he was with me also until the end. Q: And how did you divide the duties? A: With Andres I shared the office. Shin-nit-skie (ph) had his own office. But I put Andres in my office. Q: Did you get along wi th Shin-nit-skie (ph)? A: Yes, oh yes. Q: Did you have to write reports directly to Rum-cof-ski (ph) or who did you report to? A: Yes. To Rum-cof-ski (ph). Directly to him. Q: And did he have comments? A: Well, naturally, but in general he was satisfied with the way I handled it because in the beginning since it had to be organized we were three days and three nights, I got maybe two or three hours sleep, because I want to be with th e people. I have to wo rk sixteen and eighteen hours and then I let them go and I meet them, somebody else would work , so we registered day and night. Three days and three nights. Q: So people stood in line? A: Yes, stood in line. A: There were crowds of people. Q: To get their ken-car-ta (ph) or ous-vise (ph) or what? A: Sure. It was like a ken-car-ta (ph) and this ken-car-ta (ph) they were getting their rations every week. A: The ID they get later on from the archives, from Shun-dul-dom (ph), no, from Nef-tall-en (ph) who was in charge of it too, for ID cards. So he made out the ID cards afterw ards but the people had to be delegated to the various factories. Q: And how did you make the decision about the, were the factories already set up? A: No, they were in the process of setting up. And we had to select the people to go there. Q: And did you know how many pe ople could go into each factory or you made an approximate? A: Well, they gave me a demand. I can take now twenty, I can take now fifty, I can take now a hundred, I can take now five. So, whatever the demand was. A: He™s head of the workers or the factory... A: They had to come to me an d tell me of what they wanted. A: A paper assault, we can have a hundred people working there. Q: But, three days and three nights that you were re gistering people, are you at the same time as you registering them designating them for a particular factory? A: Yes. Q: So how long from the time that Rum-cof-ski (ph) hired you for this until you began to actually register people? A week? Two we eks? I mean, it had to take you some time to figure it out? A: It took me about 10 da ys, if I remember right. Q: To organize, to figu re out how to organize? A: Yeah, to organize my office. Q: And your talk ing about 1940? A: 1940, yes. Q: And then, when people started there were demands for deportations and so me of the people were your workers from factories, right? A: Yes. 39 Q: And then people came and said, I hear there is a free space in the comb factory, or paper assault or...? A: No. A: There was no choice, they were assigned to where ever there was an opening and if they fit in, you had to know something. A: You see, don™t forget that a lo t of people volunteered to go out of the ghetto. Forty-one, fortytwo, their still volunteers. And then came the demands. We want 1500 people, we want 1000 people, whatever. And then, where were the peop le? Everybody had to work so naturally we had given, like old people, I had made out maybe 500 or 600 papers to go to the straw resort, for instance. They were sitting there, there was nothing to do because there was that much work and that much places but people had, that they were delegated to the straw aut-tie-lum (ph) where we had old people, sick people. I must have made a few thousand people like this, you know. So, to answer your question, it took me ab out ten days to organize the staf f and I added as we went along and naturally after we were not through with the registries because, but three days and three nights it took to get the bulk into paperwork so they could get to the kitchen to get some food or get some, or where ever the food was distributed. Q: So you registered ov er 100,000 people in th ree days and three night? A: Yes. You cannot image what it was like. Q: I think I™m right. 1 20,000 at that time? In the beginning, in 1940? A: Oh no, it was more. A: When the ghetto was clos ed we had over 200,000. A: Over 200,000, almost a quarter of a million people we had in the ghetto. A: But then, very shortly the fi rst transport was organized. Wher e the rough element was sent out first. And then a lot of volunteers came to be out of the ghetto. Q: Did they send a lot of very, very poor people? A: By what do you mean, very p oor people? Everybody was poor! Q: What I am wondering is , was their a hierarchy in the ghetto in terms of the population? Some people came in wealthy, right? Some people came in with things, other people came... A: But they had to give everything away. There was a special place . Jewelry first... Q: But did everybody gi ve everything away? A: No, no, you are absolutely right . Some people came in with some valuables. Then they started later on if they needed, and everybody was trading some valuables for food. A: Bertie, we didn™t turn in our jewelry until the last day. Q: But that™s what I mean. A: That™s what I just said. That everybody who had something could bring it in because nobody, they didn™t have to undress, like when they went to the camp in Auschwitz, they had to completely strip and everything was taken aw ay from them. So, naturally, pe ople came into the ghetto with whatever valuables they had. But they did not hide. Q: Right, but there would be some people who might not have had anything? A: Absolutely. Most of them. Because let™s not forg et that there were a lot of poor Jews in Poland. Q: Were they more vulnerable? A: Vulnerable in what sense? Q: Well, vulnerable in terms of the amount of food they would get, their inability to barter or...? A: No. They were better equipp ed to withstand these environments than the higher class of people because they were poor people. They were always in need for something so they could adjust to these bad circumstances and conditions much easier than like, people like my father-in-law who 40 was a very affluent man. He had everything he wa nted because he was a big owner of a big factory, okay? So naturally, he suffered much, much more and had much more trouble adjusting to these conditions than the guy who was poor. A: When you see the pict ure from my wedding, he looked like a skeleton. A: So also, on the survivor list, when you look at the survivors toda y, I would say th at about 80% of the surviving class were poor people. A: Bert, be careful. A: Today, if you talk to them, everybody was a big man with their factories and had a big working staff for themselves and everybody was rich and we know that they were eaten up by the lice. So you find that the element, or the class of people wh o were in that conditions before the war adjusted easier to the bad conditions in the ghetto than the better class of people, if we want to classify them. Q: Was that true for y ou? You didn™t come fr om a poor background. Q: For me I would say that sin ce I became right away in an upper position where I would get a little bit more than others I could easier adjust to the condition than most of them because as I said I was in terrific physical condition. Because I was a sportsman all the way through. I think that because of my physical condition I was able to survive and adjust to the conditions. Q: In terms of your work, what wa s the hardest thing you had to do? A: The hardest thing I had to do? That is a tough question. Q: We talked about that yesterday. A: Yes. Q: What was it at that time that made you say, I don™t want to be doing this anymore? Was there a specific incident or was it a set of incidents that happened to you? A: No, the demands which were set forth to the ____ ____, to the department of labor, which I could not combine with any of my philo sophy and my characters. And wh en we actually were forced to support the committee who had to make lists of deportations, I just coul dn™t digest that. And that™s why, also with the influen ce of Irene, that I finagled myself ou t of that and let my other partner do this job. That was the time I would not, I would have loved to ge t out of it, out of the position I was in. Q: And why do you thing, I know that Rum-cof-ski (ph) threaten ed you, but that was different. Why didn™t he say to you, you™ve got to do it? This is part of the job, you can™t do part of the job and not the other part of the job? Do you have any idea? A: No. Q: Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-sk i (ph) or just other heads of departments questioning or thinking about phi losophy and moral aspects of the work and the ch oosing and...? A: I am sure such conditions, such c onferences and discu ssion took place. Q: Do you recall any sense of, more theoretical conversations? A: Certain occasions, yes. We could discuss personal th ings and personal ideas. A: When the Rabbi came, he was playing chess with the Rabbi. It was then that they had some discussions. Because Bert had a dilemma you know. There was a lot of nepotism going on, there was a lot of, like, my own cousi n. They came in, they wanted to bribe you and Bert would take them by the neck and throw them ou t. He was the heavy one. But he just couldn™t believe that you could put a price on a human life. Q: So what did you talk about with the Rabbi when you played chess? A: Various things of what his experiences because he had much more contac t with the people than I had. To him they came with al l their complaints and all their he adaches and conditions while they did not have, my door was not open to the general population be cause they had to go through 41 various instances before they coul d come to my office. You could not just walk into my office because otherwise I would have never been able to do anything. Q: What extent did you feel as tools? A: What? Q: As tools, used by the Germans by how impossible your situation and position, yours and Rum-cof-ski (ph) and others? A: Well, I must say thank heaven that I never had anything to deal with the Germans. My dealing was directly with Rum-cof-ski (ph). Q: But in general, they built a certain structure in which the Jews in the ghetto had to do things that otherwise maybe they had to do, the Germans? A: I couldn™t think of anything they asked us to do what they should do because they just... Q: Well, like they assign people to factories and produce thing for them? A: For themselves, for them personally? Q: No, not personal ly. For the good of the Reich? A: Well, that was the purpose of our existence in the ghetto. A: Of our survival. A: We survived because of that. Q: So you didn™t see yourselves as being manipul ated by them in some sense, you thought, Rumcof-ski (ph) in some way fe lt he was manipulating them in order to save people? A: No, we were just doing what was in that condition, we were put in that condition by the elders of the Jew in prolonging our lives by working for them. This doesn™ t make any near collaboration. Q: No, no that™s not what I meant. What I meant is to what extent you felt that the Germans forced you to be in a position which felt so uncomfortable as to the point to say to Rum-cofski (ph), Ok, I don™t want to do that anymore. A: The Germans did not pu t any demands on myself. Q: Not personally, but in general? A: The put demands on their own... A: They put demands on the ghett o. And the spokesman was Rum-cof-ski (ph). Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Yakovobitch (ph), these two people. These two people were the liaison people between the ghetto and the German ghetto fo-vert (ph). They got the demands and they had to give the orders on down to the other people of what has to be done. Q: I mean, one instance of it is the Germans could have said, we are going into the ghetto and we are going to take 15 00 healthy people... A: They did it. Q: No, I know. Bu t they also said, you choose them. A: Yes. Q: You bring the, you make the deportation decision. A: First they did. First they said. And if the demand was not met, then they came in and did it themselves. Q: So, one could have made the choi ce, we™re not going to do it? That is a choice, that it could have been made, I don™t know what that would have meant? A: Yes. The result was that they did it themselves. Q: There is a description in th e chronicle again, mayb e in the Polish book, in which there was a demand for 1500 healthy me n in February of 1944. A: Yes. Q: In which Rum-cof-ski (ph) asked for the heads of the departments to come and... 42 A: Yes, and they had to be hea lthy people and they had to be ex amined by the doctors, you know, that they are healthy. Q: And people tried to get out of this meeting and he said, if we don™t do it then they will do it. A: Right. And they did, they did. Q: Now you, in the chroni cle™s description of that meeting, it starts saying he asked you to do something but for better or worse Clinger or some other man did it, but it doe sn™t say you refused. But from your description of yourselves... A: Bert did not refuse. Q: You refused and then it says, for better or worse this other man did it. A: Your talking about Bert, he didn™t refuse, he just manipulated Rum-cof-ski (ph) because he was sick. He couldn™t go sick... Q: No, because there™s an empty space in this report where it goe s from you being asked to do something and it™s saying, for bette r or worse, so-in-so did it, it doesn™t say anything about how it happened. A: okay. A: No, because, are you talking ab out Lut-sek (ph) in Lut-sek™s (ph) book, Dr. W. Lu t-sek-ies (ph)? Q: Yes, the chronicles of that meeting. But he didn™t write the chronicles, he translated what had been written before. A: No, he collected all th e data from the Archives. A: Now, but, I was ab le to get out of it. Q: Right, right. A: okay. It wasn™t easy. It was not easy to get out of it. And people still thought that I was involved. Q: To what extent were you aware that there wa s hatred towards Rum-cofski (ph) and the whole Jewish Counsel and to what extent was their admiration that, yes, you saved our lives by giving us work? A: There were I think a much smaller percentage of the ghetto people who felt favorable towards Rum-cof-ski (ph). Why, the mass, the bulk of the people hated Ru m-cof-ski (ph) and put him in, thought of him in such a way that he was a demagogue, that he was a tyrant and that he did mean well for the ghetto. We know better . We who saw everything an d were involved in almost everything know better. That he was the man who really manipulated the Germans at that time and was able to convince them to let us do what we had to do so that we can survive. Q: So what did he have to offer that it was so valuable to the Germans? A: The work. Q: That was so valuable to them? A: We had tremendous talents. Yes, we had talents in every pha se of the human being, whatever there is to do. We had the intelligence, we had the workmen for it, we had the architects. A: We had the brains. A: We had everything. We ha d everything in the ghetto. Q: But you also have Bebof who wanted this, right? A: Bebof? Well, he felt that he has something, a force which he can use. Q: Right. So, it was... A: And he was able to convince all the leading people to have the ghetto provide _____, so what they intended to do. Q: Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops, that they ran quite differently. 43 A: Absolutely, but the only thing is that they were able to communicate with our sites, able to buy weapons and arm themselves. Q: Their work was not that valuab le, it was the same work they were doing now in Warsaw or in Kov-now (ph)? A: Yes. But what finished it? The riot. The uprising. A: No, Bertie, before that they were n™t as organized as the Lodz ghetto. Q: No, the deportations are before the uprising. Q: In 1942, there were 330,000 people deported. A: So they could not satisfy the Germans as we could. Q: So you think that it was the quality of their work or? A: Probably. Because if they would have satisfi ed the Germans as we had, they probably would have also been left alive. Q: That™s very interesting. Q: But, of course, Warsaw is not in the Reich, it™ s in the general government and was in a different situation. A: It was the symbol of Poland and the Germans hated the Poles. Do you realize that we had factories, you name it and we had it. Metal, everything. Q: Would you like to l ook at some of them? A: This is the comb factory. I don™t know this one. A: The comb factory? Q: Was there a comb factory? A: Not that I know. A: Not that I know of. And this ________ is indubitabl y the comb because he has a Bunsen burner, what we call the Bunsen burner an d he has some metal here too. Q: Do what do you think it is? A: This definitely will be the metal resort. A: They had a fake metal resort. Q: How did they get combs from this? A: You made combs in con centration camps. The Lodz ghetto pa per resort is what it was, so it wasn™t a comb fa ctory, it was a paper resort. A: These are grinding tools, gri nding and sharpening the tools. Q: So you think it was all metal resort, right? A: Yes. A: The same thing here. A: Here they have, you know, combs is very easy to make. A: Iron horns at the comb fa ctory again, comb factory. A: Here you see combs. Q: Did these factories have names other than the name of the kind of work? A: Only the kind of work, like metal resorts, clothes resorts, shoe resorts... A: I don™t even know that we had a comb factory. A: No. Q: And you were head of the labor department? A: That™s news to me! A: Yeah, to me too. A: We didn™t have a comb factory. A: Yeah, mother did my combs. Comb s are very easily made, you know that? 44 A: Here they are grinding them, but... A: Yeah. Jack-o-vich (ph) made for me in the concentration camp a comb from metal. He made it, it was easy. Q: Well maybe there were metal combs to be made? A: okay. It has to be metal comb because there was no plastic at that time. Q: Of course. So, maybe part of a metal factory was making combs? A: It had to be that, it had to be th at because they had to be metal combs. A: ______________, he was in charge of the metal department, he lives in Cleveland. Q: How big were these factories? A: Big. A: The metal factory was big. Q: But some of them woul d be smaller than others? A: Yeah. The hat factory was small. Q: The hat factory? A: Hat factory. They had a hat factory and lingerie and... Q: Did people come asking for protection? A: Oh yeah, oh yeah a lot. Q: What did you do? A: What Bert did? He __ ____ ____ _____ ____ _______, and he made enemies. Q: They come to you to ask for protection to come back to your boyfriend or husband at that time? A: Yes, yes, yes. Q: How did it make you feel? A: Awful, awful. But I had an influence on him a nd he always made the right judgment because he is a very honorable man, I have to say it in front of him. He had integrity, this is what drew me to him. Q: And me, God forbid y ou shouldn™t say it in front of him. [Laughter] A: Yes. Q: The rubber factory wh ere you were working? A: Yes. Q: Was that large? There we re two hundred women working w ith you. That was large? A: Yes, it was large. Q: Was there more going on in that fact ory than just the coats you were making? A: No, coats. Rain coats, rubber coats. A: This here, it was metal, pots and pans. A: The same here. No, here they could dress, or tailoring. Q: Pots and pan was part of the metal factory? A: Yes. A: What is this? A: Shoeing workshop. Yes. That™s correct. A: Yeah, this is manufacturing. A: Pop-e-nich (ph). Says there Po p-e-nich (ph). Th at™s the scale. A: Yeah, they weigh something. A: Feather resort. A: Oh, no, you know where we we re collecting the feathers? In the church were I was working. A: That™s a scale and the feather resort. 45 A: We had the whole church, it was piled with feathers and we had to put it in containers. And it went to Germany, you know.

He had all kinds of acquaintances. A: Head of the bakery department. Q: Well maybe what I should do is call you when you get home next week and you sit with your telephone book and give me the na mes and addresses of people you think would be interesting to contact. A: No, Betsy, Bertie. A: This is Ed-lisa-ro-vich (ph) brother? A: Yeah. This is the baker, Bert. This is the one, he passed away. Q: What was his first name? A: That™s a good question. Head of the bakery. A: I don™t know. Q: Why are the children wearing the hats? A: The children were wo rking too in resorts. A: Electrical service. A: Stosh-strum (ph). A: So they were apprentices? A: Yeah. Q: Was the hat a sign of something? A: Probably, but I don™t know. A: Any more? Q: So much more. My head is exploding. I can imagine that your head is exploding too! A: Come and visit us in Connecticut. Stay over the weekend. Q: I would like to make sure th at you will send photo graphs, documents that you will get them all back within a week. A: All right. Q: Within a week yo u™ll get it back. A: All right. Q: So why don™t we gi ve them th e Fed Ex? Q: No, will you send it by Federal, please don™t send it by regular mail. A: Yes. Q: Give them a Fed Ex... Q: What you do is on the form, it says, b ill the recipient... Q: No, no, no, we™ll give it to them. Q: The whole envelope? Q: Not just the envelope but the form so that we can write in... Q: Our address and... Q: Yes, so all they have to do is put the photographs in an envelope, so th at you don™t have to do anything. Q: I never did that, I don™t know. okay. Q: Yeah, that would be easier on her. Q: okay. 59 Q: Somebody gave me this, Bert. In Polish. This is from that book. It says some things about you and I™m wondering what it is you think about this. A: Henry Grubin. Q: Do you know who he is? A: No. A: Could be _________ _ Dem-yetz-kof (ph). Q: He says some not nice things about you an d I thought you might wa nt to respond to it. A: Should I read it out loud? Q: Can you read the Polish? A: [Speaking in foreign language - reading] A: Oh My God! A: [Continuing to read] A: Oh My God! Q: He™s never seen this. A: All distorted! If Bert wa s that brutal then all the... A: [Continuing to read in foreign language] A: Oh My God! A: Ignore it. I want to tell you so mething. Do you know what it is? Q: I know some of it. A: [Continuing to read in foreign language] A: Ech! What a lie! That Bert was a brutal fellow, that he was beating people in the face and that he was a floor dancer... Q: What does that mean? A: A floor dancer? A: A Gigolo! A: And that he was appoint ed to this position... A: By Bebof. With a f our week trying period. A: And because of his sister. And I have to prov e that he wasn™t appointed by Bebof because I have the proof from Rum-cof-ski (ph), I have it at home. This is a paper. And they are all, and that he use to be from Lodz and was m oved to Germany! Bert is bor n in Germany and educated in Germany. And then, that he came back to, how does he know? We never heard of this man. And how did he know Bert™s private li fe? Nobody knew it be cause we had a very low profile. He was exposed. Q: Well, I don™t k now who he is... A: I don™t know who he is either. Q: Somebody found this here because they knew we were going to interv iew you and they found this. I thought you should respond to it. A: This is, this is, you know, this is so awful. A: Yes, it is. A: How can you resp ond to anything? A: [Reading again in foreign language] A: Oh God! Q: Now what is he saying there? A: That they took away, he didn™t have to, to be responsible to Rum-cof-ski (ph) but to be both. One on one. And this ma de him even stronger in power. He was more brutal. How do you answer people like that? It is somebody very ignorant. 60 Q: He apparently, in this book, is very supportive of Rum-cof-ski (ph) so, I don™t know exactly what™s going on in his book. I don™t know what his point is. A: I wish I could read this book, I don™t have it. I never knew it exis ted. But, as I told you, he made enemies because when people came and wanted to bribe him he w ould take them by the neck and physically throw them out. He was furious! He said, he woul d come home and say, would you believe this? A: Should I read this piece here? A: Which? A: This here. A: [Speaking in foreign language] Q: Can you translate for me? A: I said it™s lies! We never say, we never, that Bebof wanted to, for them to, started to, the action to send people away and that they wrote to Mrs. Bebof and she an swered. We never saw her! I don™t know how this woman looks! A: We didn™t know th at he was married. A: He had two daughters, Bertie , I know he had daughters but we never saw a wife. He always came with another woman. Q: I™m sorry, I™m not so good in the bureau [to translate]... A: [Possibly reading from, speaking in foreign language] Q: Well, we™ll do this late r. Continue here. We ar e going over that Ruben... A: What can I tell you! It™s ju st, I am flabbergasted. Because all this is a lie. It never existed. Q: And there™s many other mistakes... A: Who™s he? Q: I don™t know who he is. A: Everything here is a lie. A: He doesn™t know hi s head from his toe. A: And there are people... Q: I wonder if we have informat ion on this book? You have this book, that was that yellow... Q: Yes. A: I never heard it, I never knew it existed. And you know what? There are people still alive, this is why I say you shouldn™t listen to what we have to say, you should contact people that were with us and to hear their part of the stor y, you know? Because na turally we would like to smell like roses... Q: No, no. I am not showing this to you because I believe it. It™s just that since they found it I wanted you to... A: It™s all together, we never saw Mrs. Bebof! Q: I wonder if Gruben (ph) knows who that is because he lives in Sweden too. A: He lives in Sweden? Q: Yes. Hand-ela Gruben (ph). A: Where in Sweden? Becau se here Herr En-nat-tica (ph) is in Stockholm. Q: I don™t know. A: Didn™t Nat-tic (ph) mention some time ago that somebody wa s spreading stories about you? A: Yes, he said something. As a matter of fact, I remember... A: But you know it went in one ear, it went out the other beca use, you know, when you know you have nothing to do with it. Q: What the difference w ith Sweden, five hours? Q: Well, Brussels is six hours. 61 A: So it must be six hours. Q: So, that™s not too late. Q: What, are you go ing to call him? A: You call Nat-tik (ph) and you talk to him! Q: Yeah. I™ll call him. Q: Floor dancer means gigolo. Q: Oh really! I didn™t kno w exactly what it means. A: Gigolo. A dancer, floor dancer. A: Look at me! I™m a Gigolo! Q: I thought that it wa s like a professional dancer in a dance hall. A: No, no, no, no. As it happen ed he is an excellent dancer. Q: Who? A: Bert is an excellent dancer! [Discussing Federal express mailing and what/how to do it] A: I have to call Nat-tic (ph) and find, he will find out. He mentioned a few years ago, this goes on for about two years. Because when he was last in New York, he went to see Lud-stick Rod-o-schitski-to-evil (ph)... Q: Well, it™s interesting. I mea n, these things come up all the time about all sorts of people. And when you find out that there™s so much wrong information... A: Everything is wrong! Q: But people don™t know it . People who don™t know... A: How can you, how can you make it right? Q: Well this is the que stion, what does one do in situations like this? A: What does one do? Q: I have it with all so rts of situations where pe ople write things and... A: Where ever we could we fought it. Like the Rabbi Stein helped us and so. Because you have to look at facts. Bertie threw peop le out when they came with bribery and stuff like that because he believed that everybody has to have the same right to survive. And he coul dn™t believe that you can die, your death time in ghetto where we were all together. But, this is unbelievable! Q: Listen, this is half a sent ence in a book of 600 pages... A: I don™t care! Q: But then we don™t know what ™s on the other 600 pages! A: Teresa, don™t forget one thing. Me. I am being with him almost 53 years old. He™s the biggest push over and he is such a softie. Q: Is that true? A: He is such a softie! Q: Would you like some orange juice? Some cold water? A: Yeah. A: I™m completely out of the _______ now. A: Don™t get excited about it, Bertie. A: I am up in arms already. A: How can people be so, you see, this is a case of jealousy. Probably was th ere and then... Q: But we don™t know if he was even in the ghetto. A: We don™t know. Q: But we can look up the list of ghetto residents and see. A: Unimportant. 62 A: If I would have been like he describes I wouldn™t be here! A: And we are in touch with all the Lodz survivors. Q: They would have gotten you? A: We are belonging to the Mes-ada (ph) which is a Zionist organization of only survivors. We meet twice a year. A: As a matter of fact next we ek we are going to be with all the Lodz people from the ghetto. Q: Where do you meet? A: We meet in Koo-chers (ph) in the Catskills. In a hotel in the Catskills, Koo-chers (ph). Q: And how many people come? A: It depends. We use to be an awful lot of pe ople but now... Q: When are you going? A: Pardon me? Q: When? A: Next week. We go next Thursday. Q: There™s another reunion of Nu remberg people then, end of May. A: I wasn™t in Nure mberg, but I know... Q: No, right. Then we are getting another... A: But I know people that were in Nuremberg and now live in Israel. A: Oh, thank you so muc h. Thank you, Darling. Q: You will not forget that? Q: No, no. I™ll ma ke them remember. A: I put it together with Bertie™s pictures. Q: And I will make a copy of your father™s picture. A: Bertie, don™t get excited. Q: Well, I™m sorry, I didn™t... A: He takes it very hard because. Don™ t read it even, it™s not worth it, Bertie. A: Well I want to know what I did! Q: I™m just wondering if he, well, I don™t know. It™s so outlandish. A: As I told you, the fellow that informed on Bert, he wa sn™t even from the ghetto. Q: No. A: He just heard he was a shish-ka! You know what a shish-ka is? A big shot! Q: Yes, but he was accusing Bert not of what, being Jewish in th e ghetto, but he was accusing him of being the Nazi, right? That ™s who they thought he was. A: They thought that he was the Chief of the Gestapo, I guess, I don™t know! As it happened, by coincidence... Q: The same name. A: But you have it in the chronicle so you know it. Q: Right. A: They didn™t do anything derogatory, they didn ™t write about Bert beca use what they say... Q: No, no, no. But if this man thought that Bert, that was obviously what the g overnment thought. That he was going, that he changed his first name, right? A: He didn™t change his first name. Q: No. Fuchs, th e Gestapo, the SS... A: Was Glinther (ph). Q: Right, was Glinther (ph). So, the government, when they were questioning Bert, obviously thought that he had changed his first name, kept his last name and thought that he was just... 63 A: But I have his birth certificate. Q: No, no, no. Of course! A: Don™t, don™t get... A: I don™t know what this guy did that he thinks he is so, and e-tag-n-scron-ig (ph). I don™t know what he™s referring to! A: London, it wa s in London... Q: It was published in London? A: Yeah, in Polish. A: Contra, London. A: So he couldn™t, he probably didn™t have a publisher he probably did it on his own because otherwise it would be in th e English, in London, the English language. It doesn™t matter, I am not going to... Q: What does it say in the fron t there, does it say anything? A: Wait a second, wait a second. A: May I see it Bertie, please! A: One moment! In 1988, co pyright Henry Gruben, 1988. A: Suddenly everyone became a painter and a writer and a poet... A: [Speaking in foreign language] A: [Speaking in foreign language] explain later. [Continuing to speak in foreign langua ge]. So, she is writing about, he got a stipend to publish this in the amount of 3,000 fune -sted-ling (ph) and he returned it and when you read the book you will know wh y he returned it. Q: That™s all it says. So it doesn™t say anything about him? A: Yeah. Q: As to who he is or whatever? A: No, no. [Speaking in foreign language]. I am surp rised that they don™t write anything malicious about Dora! I™m surprised. Q: Well, he doesn™t write anything from, apparen tly, from what somebody sa id. I haven™t read it, about Rum-cof-ski (ph). So... A: Bem-po brut-ania (ph), he was a brutal person, he writes. To repor t, after he became, after he got his power, oh my God, he started to... Q: No, I am sure nobody is reading this, but... A: He started to beat up people in the face with a horse whip. I ha ve to laugh! He was from Lodz, but for many years he was in Germany and he was deported in ‚39 and by profession he was a Gigolo. The same day that he came, Bebof sent him a nomination on this position with four weeks auck-ses-brun-dna (ph). Q: Trial period. A: I can™t believe that. A: Unbelievable. A: And that Bebof gave him an order to exchange everybody that worked for him over forty years for younger people. He had old people, he had all kinds of people working there. A: The whole thing is unbelievable. Q: When you said, the Eidelson (ph) film, that you didn™t like it at al l, either one of you. What did you find troubling about his film? A: A lot of discrepancie s. I told him. He was very upset with me. Q: Do you remember anything speci fic about what was bothering you? A: No, no. 64 Q: It doesn™t happen often that people come and say something th at, did you hear it before...? A: Oh yes, we... Q: Because you said that if you would go to Auschwitz th ey would wait for you like... A: Absolutely! A: By the same token they waited for Rum-cof-ski (ph). A: Don™t forget there was a lo t of jealousy in the ghetto. Q: Go on. A: Well, you see, because in my position people didn™t understand and they, first of all, a lot of people thought that I am the Gest apo Fuchs. When I arrived in this country I had this in my interview that, when I arrived, befo re, when I asked for my first pape rs to be able to work they denied me the first papers an d I was interrogated every single week for a year and a half. Q: Oh my God! A: Only to find out later on... Q: That it was a mistake? A: When they finally called before the last time that people accused me of being th e Gestapo man. That I sent people to death and wh at else? And that™s why I was... A: That he was a really... A: A war criminal! Q: And who wants to serve Fuchs, the Gestapo man? A: Commissioner Fuchs. A: They got him on the street in Hannover a few years ago, after so many years, somebody caught him. Who caught him, Bertie? A: I don™t recall. A: What is the fellow, that en-ropa (ph) en-ropa (ph), his brother told you that. Q: Harold? Solomon Carroll? A: Yeah. Pearl told us when we were in Israel three years ago. He was telling us that they caught him in Hannover. That Pear l caught him in Hannover. Q: And for a year and a half he was interrogated and they made him stand up. Every time they brought him in to ___________. A: And there was over ther e a chair to sit down. And always th e same questions. So finally, finally they say... A: They apologized. They were very polite and... End of Tape 4. 65 Tape #5 A: They will do it at th e same time when they give me, when they give my first papers. So when we drove home then , Irene saw in her movie ho use Rhonda Fleming, she said, that™s a good name. Q: They didn™t have to change their initials. [Laughter] A: So Bernard Fuchs became Bert Fleming. A: And we had other incidents li ke that. Like this woman in Fairfield. She didn™t know us in ghetto... A: She was a ______ child. A: Yes. And I said, how do you know somebody? After her father told her. What did he tell? When he had to lecture at the Masons, they called hi m, this and this ha ppened. What was she telling them? That Bert sent, my first name was Ya kovobitch (ph), my first husband. That he sent him to and let, get rid of him so he could marr y me, first of all. He lived and he was in a concentration camp and he, then, what was the other one? That we changed the na mes because we were hiding out. You see how we hide out? And what else was the third one? A: I don™t know, three things. A: Three things like that. And then she calls me up and tell me... Q: Very ___________. A: Absolutely. I went immediately to my Rabbi. A: He wanted to sue. A: And I wanted in Torah. A: So the Rabbi said, sue... A: The Rabbi investigated. He even called Europe and he called the Lodz Society, the Lodz survivors, and they called a meetin g and they talked. Is there some body to talk against him? So they came back to the Rabbi and said, no, absolutely not. He is not the war criminal and he didn™t do any atrocities. A: They said if many peop le would be like Bert more people would have survived. A: So, if the Rabbi calle d that woman and said, you better keep your mouth shut because he can sue you for everything you have. And that was it. A: This was two weeks before my daughter™s wedding. This is wh en Lud-zig (ph) was here, that Sunday, and two weeks later was th e wedding. Then, the woman had the nerve to call me and say, oh, you have such a lovely mother. You are so lucky. I said to her, Fren-ia (ph), how could you do such a thing? Q: Did you know her before? A: Yes, I was working in a Depa rtment store and she was friendly with our friends. She played cards with them so once I came to her house to meet our friends and then she was calling and she wanted to be friendly and I had nothing in common with her. So, she would call me, you know, I should buy her this and that. Bert was away. I had on my lunch ti me to take care of my shopping and then run home to cook his. I didn™t have the chance to buy for her, she wanted to be friendly. I had nothing in common with her. She passed away a year later. Q: What did she say to yo u when you asked her why, what were you doing? A: She heard it from her father. That Bert, I don™ t, three things. Now it™s really slipped my mind what the third, it™s going to bug me. Q: But if she was... A: She was working, going around to a lot of people and bad mouthing Bert. So we wanted to sue and the Rabbi said, a Jewish perso n, to sue a Jewish person and so on and he says, I want to find out 66 on my own and he, we didn™t give him names of people where to g o. He went right away to the Jewish, to the Lodz Jewish Survivor and they had an emergency meeting, they discussed this matter. Q: Was there any statement that th ey wrote, the su rvivors of Lodz? A: No, the Rabbi Stein, our Rabbi talk ed to the President at that time and he was, as a matter of fact, in Florida, he specially flew in from Florida to make an emer gency meeting. And the people said it was nonsense. Q: Has this happened to you, I mean, where other people have come up to you and accused you of things? A: No. Q: So their isolated incidences? A: Yes, their isolated but painful... A: As I said, we are belonging to the Mes-ada (ph) which are only survivors and a lot of them from Lodz, who went through the Lodz ghetto, and th e best of friends and they would never have accepted me if I had been that brutal floor dancer, gigolo. Q: Well, life is tough, huh? A: It™s very, very painful you know, to know that you have to fight such lies. And this is for posterity, it™s a book, it™s a printed book. A: He writes here on Herman Geri ng, on two, four, six, eight, maybe twenty pages. He writes about Gunter Fuchs. A: What does he know about him? Most of the people in ghetto they didn™t know a thing. Only a few people that were clos e knew, nobody knew anyt hing that was going on. A: Gerber Josef in two, four, six, in eight pages. What has Gerber to do with Jews after the...? Q: Well, I don™t know what the rest of the book is. It may be about policy from German... Q: It would be interesting maybe to... A: Herschel Greenspan, he write about Herschel Greenspan. Q: To get a written statement, you know, and publish it? A: You know, we should ha ve done that right after the war. To have statements from people that Bert saved them. Q: Well, it didn™t occur to you. A: What for? A: Bert always felt very st rong about it. He said... A: What did I do? A: I didn™t do anything, I know I am fine. So this is why we never reached out. A: Hannah Hovich. A: You know who that is? A: She _________. A: Gi-za (ph) is Hannah Hovich. Q: But this is also why I think your diary is im portant. Even if you prim arily want your daughter... A: No, this is the diary fr om the concentration camp... Q: No, no, no, I understand that. I am sure it™s... A: Rudolph Hess. A: Let™s forget ab out it, all right? A: Heinriech Himler. Look at it. A: What do you care? Q: This is just a name index, you know, whom he mentions. A: Adolf Hitler. Look how many pages! 67 Q: But I am sure he™s talking about policy, German policy so he has to mention the people who created policy. He™s not, I mean, we don™t even know if he was in the Lodz ghettos. If you doing a history... A: I will tell you all frankly I wouldn™t even atte mpt to read the book. It™s garbage. A: I am surprised, I would like to know whether he was in the ghetto or not. Q: I will go an d skim it now... Q: But this may not be his name. Q: I will skim the book which maybe he says, do you have his phone number? A: Who™s number? Q: Nat-tik™s (ph). A: Nat-tik™s? At home, yeah. Q: Oh, at home? okay. Maybe I will have a... A: We have Nat-tik™s home number. Q: I™ll go and chec k, I™ll go and check. Q: Oh, you need the chronicle? Q: No, no, no, it™s just the phone number for __ _______ and we could, you know, call. Maybe he could, maybe he know s him or something. A: Maybe, probably! He knows the whole world. Q: And especially since it™s in Sweden. A: You know, Nat-kit (ph), he knows everybody. He was a good guy. He is a good guy. Q: Did your sister write anything down? A: No. Q: Dora never wrote anyt hing down afterwards? A: No. Q: Did she talk much to you after the war or did you just not speak very much about it? I mean, I don™t want to know about the situation... A: No, she was with me in the Ca nnes, she never, never. She avoi ded the situation because I asked her many times very intimate questions and she, we never, she would start cr ying. Burst out crying. A: [Speaking in foreign language] A: This is the same thing as before. [Speakin g in foreign language]. Q: What is nien-ya-kego (ph)? A: Somebody, someone, like you talk about a nobody. A: That he came very irate to the central office and asked every woman that was wearing lipstick and powder on the face to come to the office. Q: He™s saying that about you? A: No. Q: He™s saying that about who? A: No, he said he ca me to the offices... Q: This man? A: Bebof! Q: I will be back in a fe w minutes. I will skim the books and try to get the information and I will call maybe... A: Oh, that would be nice . No, they say that he came, that Be bof came to the liais ons offices, there was a no-man™s zone on a market... A: The central office. A: And there were German offi cers and the Jewish officers. 68 Q: They were in the same area? A: No. Bert was someplace else. A: No, the central office. They were special [marketplace], all right? And it was completely, you couldn™t go, anybody couldn™t go in there, you had to go through procedures. A: I can™t believe it! Q: So that Rum-cof-ski™s (ph) offices and your sister Dora... A: They were in my office and in the ghetto, the ghetto ______ also had their own office also. Q: In the same building? A: No, separate building. Q: But in the same marketplace? A: Yes. Q: So when you talked with Dora and asked her questions she began to cry all the time? A: Yes. Q: And she never... A: This is why we assume that she had very personal bad experience. Q: With Bebof, your talking about? A: Yes, with Bebof . Right, Bertie? A: I mean, she could have written a book, you know, with all this information, but she didn™t. Q: Oh, ab solutely! A: She wanted to forget I guess. Q: Yeah. And no one came to try to interview her? A: No. She passed away in ‚62. Q: Yes, I know that. A: Nobody spoke about anything until the last few years. Q: Did she talk to you about, I keep thinking of Churn-yok-of (ph), Rum-cof-ski (ph). Did she speak to you about him? A: She knew that he knows me. Q: I know, but did she speak to you about what she was doing? Forget the Bebof thing because clearly there may have be en some incident that was very uncomfortable. A: No. She never said a word ab out her work or the co nditions in which she was working. No, she never mentioned it. Even after the war, she was clamming up, she wouldn™t talk. A: It™s amazing. A: It is amazing. Because every little word here was a page, was a horse whip that he was, who had in the ghetto a horse whip and who would dare to horse whip anybody! Q: No, I thought at leas t you™d want to know... A: Well, yes. A: Oh yes, oh yes, absolutely. It™s just, I don™t understand. A: Bert? Q: Do you think the other secretaries with whom your sister worked might still be alive? A: Yes, as far as I know. A: ______________, she™s in Israel, in Tel Aviv. Q: So we should think when I call you, we should try to think about the different people... A: I think I even have her address. Her sister gave it to me, Rosa. Q: Do you think she might, I mean for all I know she™ s been interviewed in Israel, we™ve had a project there, ____________ had a project, but it would be very nice if that was th e case to get... A: It™s so painful, it™s painful! 69 Q: Well, of course, it™s painful but it™s also re ally important historical ly because those women probably knew more than a lot of other people did. A: Absolutely! Q: Secretaries alwa ys know a lot. A: Oh yeah. And so did Schel-mek-bertie-feldon (ph), he was on the Bous-kein-e-neck (ph). A: Schel-mek-bertie (ph)? No he was not. No, he was in the ___________ no? What did Schelmek do, I don™t know what he did in the ghetto? A: How did he have the connection when we gave him the jewelry to exch ange, how did he have the connection with the Germans? A: He isn™t over the hill from the Germans, I don™t know where he got the stuff, but where was he working? Wasn™t he wo rking at ____________? A: Nat-tik (ph). Nat-tik (ph) was giving us the meat for the do g, don™t you remember? Q: You had a dog in the ghetto? A: Yeah. I got it from the head of the fire depa rtment. A puppy. And then we had to give him away, I don™t know what happ ened, Bert? With the dog? A: I don™t recall. Q: That™s the second dog you had to... A: No, we had one dog. This is the one, the first one in my house. A: And then at my home town I ha d a German Shepherd, from the bord er police. Very sharp dog. But he was one man dog. A: He didn™t like me. A: When I was away, he wouldn™t ta ke food from Irene. I had to give him away when we left for the... A: No Bertie, he became vici ous when he jumped on me... A: Wait a second, I am just going to point out. I had him until the la st days since wh en we left on our foot to go to When-toff (ph), to the camp, before we came to this United St ates. So I gave him to Is-peski (ph) on the Oar-stousch (ph). A: No, to Tren-ka ( ph) you gave him... A: To Tren-ka (ph). And when we came to say good-bye, Tren-ka™s (ph) son had the dog, and we came to say good-bye and so... A: The dog jumped me. A: I said good-bye and we left. And then he came back and ripped her fur coat. A: On my neck. A: He was mad that we, he felt th at we are leaving him, you know? A: Jumped on my back. Q: Now this is the dog you had when you... A: In Hannover, in Germany afte r the war. A beautiful dog. Q: Did you have dogs in the United States too? A: Always. A: But since I started traveling so we could not have a puppy becaus e, every time to give it to a kennel, you know... A: I don™t know if I shou ld be sad that we came or not becaus e this really was the last straw, you know? Because it™s such a lie. I wish you wo uld meet the people... A: If I would have really, that gu y that he describes here. We are living now in 1996. Liberated in 1945. That means 50 years. You would think so mebody wouldn™t have come and would have done something to me? 70 Q: Sure. A: If I would have really... Q: No, of course you are right. A: I would like to know where that guy is. A: Nat-tik (ph) will tell you if you call him. Q: I mean, I don™t know what he™s saying about other people. Appa rently he™s supportive of Rumcof-ski (ph) but I haven™t read it so. It sounds a little strange. A: I don™t, why? I mean , Rum-cof-ski (ph), I told you, I was objective. Q: Yes, but in writing this way of Bert, why is he writing...? A: There was a lot of jealousy about Bert. He was a young man, 24 years old and in such a powerful position. Q: Right. A: But he didn™t explo it it. It™s not him. Q: Right, right. A: You know, I know so much about him I don™t wa nt to convince you... Q: Well you don™t have to, I believe you. A: [Speaking in foreign language]. A: He was from Lodz but... A: He was a Lodzer, but lived a long time in Germany and then was in 1939 deported. Q: Which is not true. A: First of all I was born in, and I wa s not deported in 1939 only in 1938. A: He writes and he take s a lot of freedom here with the wr iting because he doesn™t know! How does he know? Nobody knew his background. I was his wife and I didn™t know his background. A: It was for ________ ___. I was a gigolo. Q: Yeah, right. A: That™s something. Nobody called me that. A: So. I called you a Casanova but... Q: That™s different. That™s better than a gigolo. A: Well, it™s sad. Very, very sad. Q: Now tell me, when your children have aske d you, I mean, you™ve said at least your older daughter has wanted more inform ation. When she aske d you questions you didn™t want to speak with her or? A: No, we did, if she asked we answered. Q: Was she hesitant to ask you? So that™s why she doesn™t know so much do you think? A: We didn™t talk much about it. Such things that happen ed, two weeks before my daughter™s wedding. Naturally they both knew it. And they know their father. Q: No, I understand that, but yo u said that they di dn™t know the story in detail. Right? A: Details? Nobody knows. You are the only one that knows. We never to ld anybody anything. Q: But what I™m wondering about is , is it because sometimes people do n™t want to talk. Other times they want to talk and their waiting for someone to ask them a question. And I™m just wondering if your children, because often children with their parents, no matter what the past is, you know... A: She never came w ith direct questions. Q: That™s what I mean . I think children... A: Oh, but Bert. You know mother told her plenty. My mother was very vocal. A: She might have talked, she might have discussed it with her grandmother. A: And they were very, very close with their granddaughter. 71 A: But she never asked me direct questions about it. Q: Was your mother more vocal about it without so mebody asking questions? A: My mother... A: My mother lived in the past. Mother-in-law, she lived in the past. Q: And so she would... A: And she was telling her feelings and her though ts she was telling my daughters. They were very, very close, very close. And they knew a lot from my mother and my mother knew a lot and she told them as it is and they looked up to her. Q: That™s interesting that children don™t often, there is a shyn ess about asking their parents about their past. No matter what... A: Well, you see when they were young growing up we had our life to live, she had a hard time. Because we always went so mewhere else or she never had really to be able to socialize and have a circle of friends. A: Not because we were hiding out, it™s because his job took him. A: In my profession, traveled. An d at that time we did not have a chance, or it never came to an occasion that she came to ask about this. Later on when she grew up and knows and she has her own child, she came around to be interested, more interested in what happened. And some she knows, some we told her, but sh e would like to know more . And when we get this tape now with your interview... A: When she didn™t know everything. A: She will know a little bit more. Q: Has she read about th e Lodz ghetto? Did she read the chronicle? A: Yes. She has and she also has the film. A: And you wrote your obse rvation on the margin, reme mber, in the chronicle? A: Yes, yes. A: Because there were a lot of di screpancies also and Bert wrote... A: Why does the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto in which I appear, why didn™t they write about this like this? Q: Bert, they don™t at all. A: They would, if it was true, they would! A: And they researched everything , I think very carefully because this is all documented what they have in the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto, is it not? A: Yes. Q: Yeah. A: So is this really, if this would be the case, it definitely would have been written. Q: No, it™s clear that it™s not...right, no question. A: Somewhere. Q: Right. Can I ask you somethi ng? Today, in some ways, and I don™t know if it™s because we were going through the pictures, th at you were more, and maybe Teresa ™s questions were better than mine, that you were able to talk more about some things? Or is it because we™ve now been doing it for two days? A: No. Because it was laying still for such a long time and today we were faced with the facts, we saw the pictures so... A: If you have orange juice from the concentrate and you let it sta y. If you have everything down there and the water is up with things, and you have to shake it. And we now stirre d everything up, okay? So now everything is again... 72 Q: Going? A: Going, and it™s fu ll. It™s all, it™s not any more sepa rated. It™s solid from the shaking. Q: So it™s possible th at it would have been better if we had known this, to come to the museum first and look at the pictures and then do the intervie w and on video? I don™t know, I am trying to figure out... A: Maybe yes, maybe no. Q: We don™t know? A: We don™t know, we don™t know. Q: I mean, I™m very glad that I decided that we would tape the conversation today because... A: Yeah, I wanted to have it out of th e way. This is the purpose we came. Q: Because you were able, I mean, it seems that the more we talk the more comes out. But I think the pictures are very help ful because they trigger... A: Yes, well, we were able to id entify for them qu ite a few people. Q: Right. Absolutely. Are you glad you did this? A: In a way yes, in a way no. A: Yes and no. I™m glad because we can live with ourselves. We are not the kind of people we, we would never benefit from so mebody™s misery. This is not the type, listen! If we went to the flasten-tralen (ph), the ghetto, and yo u had a witness, and Nat-kit (ph) who was working there and he was giving us portion of meat that the dog should be havi ng and we shared it with the dog. And I had a witness. But you see, we didn™t tell the Rabbi Stein to call him, we didn ™t tell him to call anybody. He went to the Lodzer people and they gave him names and he spoke to some people. But, boy do we have already people that I know will really cheer us. But we never gave names. But the two survivor girls we told you about it, I want you to talk to them. They are very sharp women. Very nice. Q: But when I was asking you about whether you ar e glad you came here an d talked about your, is it difficult to live with it because now we™ve shaken up the glass? A: This is difficult to live with because it™s a big lie. A: Well, first of all, as I said I had a very restless night and... A: Eight o™clock, quarter after eight we were in bed already. We were so shook up. Q: Yes. A: I was exhausted. Mentally. And for some reas on I was very restless and I couldn™t sleep well. I napped then I was awake and I napped. A: Cat napping. I don™t know, I feel so much sh ame that such a thing can surface now. I can™t believe it. A: Somebody says something, is something different but written do wn in a book and, I don™t know what kind of, how many boo ks are printed or in how many bo oks were sold an d how many books were read, right? A: Anybody that reads it, it™s just awful. A: Somebody who really doesn™t kn ow reads this. My God, what kind of monster was this guy? _________ says you become such a powerful guy. Q: But does it become important to you even in light of that, that you were ab le to tell part of your story? And that it is documented? A: Certainly, certain ly it™s important. A: But listen, when we talk about ourselves, we want to smell like roses, right? A: Yeah but we still state only facts. A: It wasn™t a thing that we wanted t o defend ourselves beca use there is nothing to defend. 73 Q: No, I didn™t bring you here to defend yourse lves. I brought you here to tell your story. A: But we said it as it is and there are still living people that can witness. A: Mmmm, interesting. A: Yeah. So many _______ should have taken testimonies from all these people but this should be going back 40 years ago when ever ybody was alive because Bert had a lot of people that called him and thanked him. That they are alive. He™s responsible for it. A: Well. You know that I mentio ned it to you that I made an enem y and a friend at the same time. A: Maybe he™s one of them? Q: No, but you were in a situation where you couldn™t do for everybody. It was impossible. Nobody could. So, there™s... A: Nobody could. I am only human. A: Do you think if he co uld do something, he wouldn ™t do it for my father? That my father would be alive if he would have the power? Q: Right. But what I™m saying is th at in situations of, ev en not situations of di stress. All kinds of situations where people have some power, some auth ority. They can™t do ev erything for everybody. A: No. Q: So, you cannot ever satisfy people. A: I™m guilty. Q: And in this situation it™s particularly difficult. It was diff icult for you. You di dn™t even want to do it in some ways but it... A: okay. Then you can say I wanted something from him and he denied it. He didn™t do it. okay? All right, so he disappoint ed me. But bring up lies? Make such statements? A: Bertie, do you remember a fellow that use to be your family so me distant relation and you were so helpful to him? A: Yes. A: He was always in your office whenever I came. A: A cousin. A: Some distant cousin and he had a wife. A: No, you remind me, yes. A: I don™t know his name anymore. And whenever I came t o, happen to come over to his office this was, he was always asking Bert for something and I said to Bert, my God, he™s always asking you for things. He survived and his wife survived. And you know where we met him? After the war in Hamburg it was a Schmelling match, boxing match. And he said to him, yes you are a good guy. And turned away. A fellow that had always, alwa ys asked for things and always, whenever Bert could he always did it. Probably once he had to deny him, he couldn™t. Q: You know it can al so be people sometimes get very a ngry at people who have control. A: Absolutely. Q: Even if they do good thin gs for them. B ecause it means... A: Jealousy. Q: Well it™s not, I don™t, it™s sometimes more complicated than jealousy. Sometimes it™s because you don™t have power yourself. A nd you have to rely on someone else. And that™s not an easy, human situation. A: But still to make such statements. Q: Well this is different. We don™t know what, you know. 74 A: And you know, now it da wns on me. When I starte d to read it I remember that Nat-tik (ph) told us somebody™s bad mouthing him. But we didn™t pay any attention. We did not ask who it is and where it is. Now... A: I couldn™t care less. A: Now it came to... Q: You mean you th ink this is it? A: Could be. Because he lives in Queen s and in Sweden too. And Stockholm. A: Probably. Q: Well, we™ll see what Teresa comes up with. A: It™s unbelievable. Q: Well, it™s a very complicated se t of circumstances. And it brings out the best and it brings out the worst, right? I mean, I™ m sure you sa w it there? A: Yeah. But I just, I just, can™ t digest it. Can I have this? Q: Yes. A: Thank you. Put it together with the envelope. Is the Federa l Express, does it have room in the envelope. No? In there. Try it now. Q: Now, do you want to go and see the permanent exhibition for a little bit or are you too tired? A: I am tired. I™m tired and I™m exhausted me ntally. Very upset. Q: That™s what I thought, th at if you didn™t go earlier. A: I™m very upset because this is unbelievable. Q: Well, now I feel terrible, I... A: No, don™t feel terrible. I™ m glad that I learned something. A: We didn™t have an inkling about it. Q: Well I had no idea yesterday. Amy said that somebody had found this just this morning so, I thought, you know, that we would show it to you. A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it™s very interesting because otherwise how woul d I know that something like this exists. All right. You will excuse me? Q: Absolutely. You want more water? A: No, that™s why I take the candy now so, I get a little bit more saliva action. A: I™m just, right now it bugs me what fry-ana (ph), you know, the th ird thing that she said to the Rabbi. A: Yeah. One was that I sent Mentak (ph), that I sent him on to th e ghetto so that I can marry you? A: No, that you got rid of him. A: Oh yeah. That I got rid of him. So that I could marry you. A: Then we changed our names because we were hiding out. A: Yeah. A: And the third one, I don™t know. It was three things, I remember. A: Yeah. A: I don™t know. Q: Did... A: Yes? Q: I was just thinking about your temper and I wa s wondering if you thought that, in a way it™s a stupid question. If you had every had to have dealings with the Germans that you actually could have survived? Would you ha ve been furious with them? A: I didn™t unders tand the question. A: I don™t either. 75 Q: Because it™s a conditional question, it has no reality. I was wondering that if you could have, remember we talked abou t your being a hot head? A: Yes. Q: And that with Rum-co f-ski (ph), you held your temper beca use he was also a hot head so it would have been impossible. A: Yes. Q: And I was wondering if you had dealing with the Germans wh ether you could have, not that nice guy, but Bebof. A: No, the nice guy had no thing to do with it. Q: Right. Whether you coul d have kept your temper? A: He would have to control his temper I guess. Because he never blew his top with Rum-cof-ski (ph) just out of respect fo r an old man. Bert knew wh en to loose his temper... Q: Did you every loose y our temper? Either alone or with so meone, I mean, out of frustration? A: I™m sure I did. A: I know with Sche-b it-ski (ph) when they came and wanted... A: I almost killed the guy. Q: What? When they wanted to bribe you? A: Yes. A: Nobody buys me. A: Then I wish Abromic Kud-meric (ph) would be available, Bert? A: Well, Eddie Kline? A: No, Eddie was living with Dora so he doesn™t know how it conditions. A: He came, every time he came to me he play ed something on his harp. A: You want to call him? He™s the adopted son of his sister. Whenever he had problems, he was a little boy, he would come to me... Q: It would be very interes ting to talk with him, sure. A: He always came to me, he said, you are the only one I could talk to. Q: How old was he then? A: He was a boy of 14. A: No, 12 or 13. A: Or something like this. A: I know about, a young boy. Very lovely young boy. A: Today he™s in his fiftie s, close to sixty, huh? A: Yeah, I think that he must be in his sixties, Bert. A: In his sixties, yes. Q: Do you see him? A: Oh yeah, whenever we have a chance. A: Yes, oh yes. Q: And where does he live? A: In Montreal. A: Yeah. I told you that his da ughter is an international lawyer and his son is a professor. A: And he himself made himself a fortune by inve nting and customizing sanding machines, like for pig pens? The automatic assembly machines where certain parts are coming together and out comes the end, the fixed product, the finish ed product. So, he made a lot of money with that. And he is an ardent surfer rider. And he lived now for four month... A: A surfer. 76 A: A surfer for four month or five months in a lot. A: So he can surf. A few years ago he was su rfing in Australia, on a surfing trip. Q: Do you think he remembers a good deal about the ghetto? A: I™m sure he did, I™m sure he did. Q: Well, when I call you, includ e that in one of the names. A: He lives next to Pierre Trudeau. Your looking from his window your looking to... A: On the balcony of Trudeau. Not that I need witnesses, okay? Q: No, I wouldn™t, I™m not doing it because of that. A: I™m just saying. Q: But it™s always very in teresting when you can ha ve a group of people... A: To hear two sides? Q: It™s not two sides. But to h ear different people talk ing about the same situation. And people who had relationships with each other because it makes it a much richer view because what... A: You can average it out. Q: Yeah, but you learn a great deal from having, when a friend of mine did interviews with four or five women who were in th e hospital in Auschwitz... A: Talking about this Rabbi Stein, he even called Kin-roos (ph) in Israel. A: Dr. Kin-roos (ph) was the pr esident of the Lodz survivors. A: And he wrote us a letter telling us. A: Yeah, I too wr ite the letter. A: Yeah but I mean, he wrote us a letter telling us that Robert Stein contacted him. So, he met, not just throughout Europe but he went to Israel. A: He called Israel, he didn™t go there. Q: Now, you see, you were in such a unique position and you prob ably are, I don™t know if there™s anyone else who was in, I don™t mean in the job you had, but in a similarly high administrative position anymore that can talk with the survivors... A: Well, no one else is alive. Q: No one has survived, no one is al ive. So, it™s a very special set of understanding that we can get from you. And to then have people who knew you, and also talk about their own lives and their relationship with you, it simply make s the story, it™s like talking with all members of the family not just with one member of the family. A: Bertie, let Joan call Mala Ordner (ph). She knew a lot. She was a doctor in on e of the resorts, in one of the factories. Sh e lives in Spring Valley. A: No, what for. Q: Are any of the doctors from the hosp ital alive? A: Dr. Ved-ger (ph) in Tel Aviv. Dr. Kin-e-roos (ph). A: Oh, no, he wasn™t in ghetto. Dr. Jin-ski (ph), he wasn™t in ghetto, no? A: He wasn™t in ghetto. Q: What happened to Rum-cof-ski™s (ph) wife, second wife? A: They killed her too. A: They finished in Auschwitz too. A: The whole family. Q: But, the Germans, they went to the gas chamber or th at they were killed. A: They went to the gas chamber. A: No, Bertie, they were killed when they arrived in Auschwitz. A: Heim and Josef, but I don™t think the women. 77 Q: They separated the men from the women? A: I don™t know, I can™t tell you because... A: I don™t think the women. A: This is what we heard, we don™t know details. Q: That they separated them so if he had gone to a barrack and was killed she would have not been there? A: We don™t know details. A: Many people told me that they know that ther e was a girl... A: Oh, your talking ab out Lucia Szymanowicz. A: She went to so many men from hand to hand. A: She was working in Bert™s office. A: And she couldn™t, you couldn™t st and it, that I did not, that I i gnored her. That I didn™t make a pass at her or something like this. A: Bertie, but she was stea ling cards. She was stealing people™s food cards. Q: In the ghetto. A: She was in his office. And Rumcof-ski (ph) sent her out, they caught her and he sent her out on a transport. She went to Auschwitz and became a madam there. She was walking, while others were working, she was walking around in negligées and robes and stuff like that. A: And she was waiting for me. A: And we found out. Q: In Auschwitz? A: Yeah. She had a lot of pull, she had a lot of men that she had, she survived. But nobody knows where she is, where she lives. A: She had something to give. A: And she said it. A: Yeah. She didn™t make anyt hing of it, on the contrary. Q: I don™t know how she did that in Auschwitz. A: Oh yeah. In Auschwitz? There was a lot of it going on. What are you talking about. Q: Well, there was some but you had to be in special places. It was not so easy. A: She was there. People did what she wanted to do. Wh at she wanted them to do. And I was told she was waiting for me. Q: To do what? A: To kill me. Or to have me killed. A: Yeah. She was a very vindicti ve person and Bert had nothing... Q: What was her name? A: Lucia Szymanowicz. Q: And when did she go to Auschwitz. A: I don™t know the date. Q: Well, I don™t mean the exact date. A: 1942, 1943? 1942. Q: Shim-a-no-vich? A: S-z-y-m-a-n-o-w-i-c-z. A: They said she was a kappo , you know what a kappo is? Q: Yeah, but what I don™t understand is those early transports, I thought they went to Helm-no (ph)? A: Not all. Maybe this was afterwards, I don™t know. A: I don™t know where they went. I really don™t know. 78 A: I don™t know when they started to send the troops to, the transport to Hel-no and I remember... Q: As far as I know all the 1942 transports went to Hel-no (ph), not to Auschwitz. A: I doubt that. A: I don™t know, so how could he survive... A: There were people that went to working camps. A: And they live. They are alive. A: And they live. From that period. Q: From those 1942 transports? A: Yes. A: So not all of them went to Hel-no (ph). And I don™t know when they started transporting them to Auschwitz. Q: As far as I know it was later. It was very late from Lo dz to Auschwitz. A: We don™t know becaus e we had no contact. A: I have no idea. Q: And Giertler is alive? A: Was. He died in Munich a few years ago. A: He died in Munich. Q: Did he ever write notes about what he was doi ng or was he ever interviewed, do you think, by anybody? A: No. A: I don™t think he would divulge anything because he was a little bit shady. He was working with the Gestapo. Q: Right. But for that reason... A: And what he did with them I don™t know but that was not kosher that he would admit to it in an interview. A: But he had a big following of people that really would do anyt hing for him. He was a good guy by nature. A: He helped a lot of people. Q: Then why do you think he went back to Germany? He lived in Germany after the war the whole time? A: Munich. A: He never was in Ge rmany before he was... A: After the war. A: After the war he went to Germany. A: He married. A very nice wo man and has a child, a son with her. He™s a lawyer . We saw him a few times when we came to Munich. Q: And he never divulged things to you? A: Nobody ever talked anymore about it. It was a chapter in your life that you didn™t want to talk about it. A: It was like a pack or an agreement amongst the pe ople not to discuss it for one or another reason. It was a period you really liked to forget. The only reason you talked about it is to give the message to the children. A: But lately when we get together, lately, we always wind up talk ing about it. Before we never did. 79 A: Because we are so much involv ed in teaching the young people no t to forget because, after all, slowly we are leaving. Nobody left to be a witness for it. So now we have to take the last few years we have to live to make sure that it is being spread out. A: I want to tell about it to Rabbi Stein. To show him that, to read it to him. Q: Does he read Polish? A: No, I will translate it for him. Q: Well, what would you like to do? Would you like to go back to your hotel, do you want to walk around at least the firs t floor of the museum? A: Don™t we want to wait on what Teresa comes up with? Q: Oh, yes, sure. Why don™t I call her. Conclusion of interview.
