So, I™d like to start with some of the things that you know about your parents. A: Yeah, so, my mother, she came from a family living in Œ in Latvia , and Œ not in Riga, she was Ventspila(ph). That™s a different city, it™s a ha-harbor in Latvia . And she had two brothers, and t-two sisters. And they owned a Œ a farm of cattle, a cattle farm up there. But Œ and of course in Latvia there was a Œ a certain amount of Jewish population. And that way Latvia also was a Œ belonged to Russia, but before it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany. And the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian occupation, or beca Œ the Russian got the Œ got the territory. And she Œ her Œ they were selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere. But then the Œ the tsar of Russia had a brother and his name was Peter. And when they went Œ they went in war with Germany, a Œ a [indecipherable] there were Œ he Œ he was afraid of the Jewish population because in those days th e Jews were friendly with the Germans, Interview with A. Zalc, L. Ragin, J. Mizrachi July 23, 2009 4and they spoke Yiddish, which is an Œ an old German. It™s a dialect of Germany from Œ from 500 years ago. So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia, they decided to Œ to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the I-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea , by Azrahan (ph), by Baku, Azrahan (ph). And they were sent there. And up there they Œ they started a new life, with different businesses to survive. And the gr Œ the grandfather, my mother™s father started because there Œ up there is a lot of fish. The Œ the caviar comes from there, and the Œ and the best fish. And the oils from the whales, too, which was like, very important in those days. So he start the factory of smoking fish, and he was very successful with that because in those days , in the first World War, the Russian army had no C-rations like today, and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a piece of bread. That was the food of the Russian soldier. And Œ and he couldn™t produce enough smoked fish for the government, so we™re Œ the government wanted they should produce more fish, they™re working day and night. So he complained about it. So they told him, don™t worry abou t it, if you™re short of labor, we give you workers. So they gave him Turkish pris oners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War, and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish. And Œ and tw o prisoners fell in love with my aunts, and they married my aunts, and when the revolution of Russia started, the war with the Interview with A. Zalc, L. Ragin, J. Mizrachi July 23, 2009 5Germans and Russians stopped, because the Germans made the Russian revolution, I don™t know if you know th at, yeah. Because they got Lenin in Switzerland, and they gave him money and they send him back to Russia to make the revolution. And when they made the revolution, th e war stopped. So those Œ those two prisoners took their wives with them to Germany, and then went to United States. And one uncle Œ an aunt went to Belgium. And my mother, she was young and she wasn™t married, so she stayed with Œ with her folks, and the two brothers went to the Russian army. And after the war, my mother was the only daughter home with the Œ with the two brothers. They went back to Latvia from Azrahan (ph). But the parents died in Azrahan (ph).
